<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I join previous speakers in congratulating you on your re-election and wish you continued success in your high and demanding office. It is appropriate that I begin my response to the Governor-General's Speech with an expression of thanks to the voters of the beautiful electorate of Robertson for bestowing on me the great honour and trust of representing them in this Parliament. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge the support and contribution of my wife Marilyn, and my sons, Michael and Sean, who, having endured the slings and arrows of eight election campaigns, somehow found the strength to back up for a ninth. Their love and courage have always been an inspiration. My gratitude is also extended to that small but indomitable team of local branch members who worked night and day to ensure the success of Labor's campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to express on behalf of my constituency warm appreciation for the efforts of my predecessor, Barry Cohen, who represented the electorate for 21 years. It would not be sincere for me to personally eulogise Mr Cohen because we are not friends. However, Barry has made many friends on the Central Coast and on their behalf I thank him for his two decades of public service and wish him well in his new career as a developer. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one has ever been moved to suggest that I am a traditionalist. However, on this occasion I am comfortable in following the true and tried convention of maiden speakers putting on record their personal political philosophy and indicating the great national and local issues that would engage their energies during their parliamentary careers. I have always been a social democrat and the recent people's revolutions in eastern Europe have served to reinforce my passionate commitment to parliamentary democracy. For the sake of those people tasting freedom from the yoke of a totalitarian regime of the Left, we must hope that they can now resist the pressures of nationalism and bigotry that half a century before saw them in the hands of the Nazis and their fascist puppets. </PARA>
<PARA> I share the vision of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of creating a fairer, more compassionate society, with opportunities open to all. It is that vision that bonds members of the great Australian Labor Party and so starkly distinguishes them from the representatives of wealth and privilege opposite, whose vision is so often clouded by motives of greed and sectional interest. </PARA>
<PARA> My Labor Party colleagues well know me as an uncompromising champion of civil liberties and the rights of underprivileged minorities. It was the cause of Aboriginal land and civil rights that first involved me, as a teenager on the north coast of New South Wales, in the political process and led to membership of the Labor Party. My strongest ambition is to be part of a Labor government that finally delivers land rights to those long suffering and oppressed people. </PARA>
<PARA> In my maiden speech to the New South Wales Parliament 20 long years ago I saw environmental protection as society's highest priority. I have not changed that view, and must say that I have derived great satisfaction from watching my own party change over those two decades from a position that environmentalists were extremist ratbags standing in the path of jobs and progress to having a well researched, principled and courageous environmental platform. Senator Graham Richardson deserves great credit for that metamorphosis which now distinguishes Labor from the redneck policies of the National Party, which still proclaims its God-given right to rape and pillage our natural environment whenever there is a quid to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> To complete this political snapshot, I should say that I am an unswerving supporter of the trade union movement and an unrelenting critic of laissez-faire and monetarist economics. With that background, no-one would be surprised to learn that I took a jaundiced view of the Government's decision to totally deregulate Australia's financial markets. One of my fears in that regard was that Australia was putting at risk her economic sovereignty and that future governments would find themselves at the mercy of decisions made in boardrooms in New York, Zurich and Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the first of four important issues that I propose to canvass in this speech. I refer to the Australian electorate's deep-seated fears about the extent of foreign investment in our primary industry and real estate. During the election campaign I was constantly assailed by constituents who were deeply angered by media reports of foreign purchases of vital assets such as coal mines, grazing properties and prime realty. The complaints were widespread and covered the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA> I have often found the need to take up the cause of oppressed ethnic minorities suffering the abhorrence of racism and I am particularly sensitive about dealing with any subject that might be interpreted as racist. However, the real issue I am talking about here is economic imperialism, not race. Foreign investment has been the lifeblood of our economy in recent times, but it is an undeniable fact that many Australians have a perception that things are getting out of hand. Their most common fear is that we are selling out our children's inheritance. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we have a Foreign Investment Review Board, but the message is pretty clear from the electorate that we had better give some thought to substantially tightening the guidelines. Our most important trading partner, Japan, would understand such a position, because Japan has always imposed severe limitations on foreign investors. The Japanese Government carefully reviews any investment in key industries, notably agriculture, forestry, fisheries, petroleum-both refining and marketing-and mining. The Japanese Foreign Exchange Council is empowered to set shareholding limits to preclude the possibility of a foreign takeover in strategic industries. Only after investment approval is granted can foreign companies purchase land or buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an extremely sensitive debate which is greatly impeded by a dearth of publicly available information on the true nature and extent of foreign investment in Australia. A public register of foreign interests would greatly assist in sweeping away some of the myths and prejudices and allow us to concentrate on the real issue, which is ensuring that sensitive industries and classes of assets remain firmly in Australian hands. </PARA>
<PARA> The ever worsening problem of drug peddling has received a high priority from the Hawke Government. One particularly upsetting aspect of the war against illegal drugs in the electorate of Robertson is the infiltration of drugs into our community from foreign vessels dropping caches to speedboats operating out of the Hawkesbury River and other waterways. I have long held the view that, if we are truly to be involved in a war against drugs and if we really regard drugs as a national emergency, then it is time that we involved our defence forces in that war. Illegal drugs find their way into Australia on ships, boats or aircraft. That is why I am convinced that we need a fully fledged coastguard service and that our Navy and Air Force ought to be given emergency powers to run that service. </PARA>
<PARA> Military aid to the civil power has always been a contentious issue. The Australian Constitution and the Defence Act permit the use of our defence forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth. However, the armed forces have always been quite commendably wary of extending military aid to our civil authorities. Problems as to the legality of such action and the extent of the military's right to use force have occasionally arisen, notably in the cases of the Hilton bombing and Cyclone Tracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless there seems to be no constitutional impediment to our armed forces providing a coastguard and, indeed, the Navy already provides such a service in the case of illegal trawlers, immigrants and the like. Of course, there clearly would need to be detailed underpinning legislation establishing the nature and extent of a military coastguard's powers and incorporating safeguards, such as the primacy of the civil power and the use of appropriate force. In recent years there has been an increasing pressure on the defence budget as cuts in government expenditure have occurred. The electorate would be much more amenable to the purchase of sophisticated and expensive aircraft and vessels were they to be put to use in the war against drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important local issue in Robertson is flooding. The central coast plain in New South Wales has for some years been suffering endemic flooding problems. They are mostly caused by local councils allowing uncontrolled filling of nature's retention basins, the coastal swamps, for residential and commercial development. Many areas in my electorate, including Woy Woy, Umina, Avoca Beach, Erina, West Gosford, Kariong, Horsfield Bay and Yattalunga are subjected to devastating floods, sometimes as regularly as three times in the year. This flooding can be particularly heartbreaking in the unsewered suburbs, where septics overflow and houses are inundated with effluent. </PARA>
<PARA> We all feel for the courageous people in Nyngan, Charleville and Cunnamulla. However, their problems occur once in decades not three times every year. My constituents and those of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) are the forgotten flood victims. They suffer the same horror but because of the regularity of their problem, it detracts from its newsworthiness. They receive no visits from Premiers or Prime Ministers with bags of money. They get no official sympathy or special relief. No mayor's charity concerts, telethons or appeals are being organised on their behalf. I am not suggesting that they are alone. For example, there are plenty of residents along the Georges River in Sydney who suffer almost identical problems. The worst aspect of the situation is that there is no hope for relief on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> Gosford City Council has the responsibility for drainage in my electorate. The current works backlog is $50m. Proposed development could double that indebtedness over the next decade. Yet, council's annual public works allocation for drainage is only $2m. In other words, there are residents in my electorate who at current rates of expenditure can expect to be flooded 75 more times before their drains are fixed. This impossible situation has led to a great deal of political buck-passing. The Gosford City Council blames the State Government; the State Government blames the Federal Government; and everybody blames the greedy developers and the careless engineers and planners who allowed the problem to be created in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituents' problem, however, is simply one aspect of a much wider issue of funding rapidly developing areas. Unfortunately, Australia has not yet shown the maturity to break away from the parochial States righters style of politics that plagued our founding fathers and now besets the Grants Commission as it divides up the tax cake between the States each year. The only sign of statesmanship or rationality on this issue came during the Whitlam years when Gough successfully sought to provide a share of taxation revenue to local government areas. Mr Whitlam, of course, represented a rapidly developing area and knew well the impossible pressures of providing infrastructure such as roads, sewerage, drainage and welfare services. I hope that during my time in this Parliament I can contribute to the movement to undo the current system of State grants and replace it with a modern system that gives the lion's share of taxes to the areas of greatest need notwithstanding State boundaries. In the meantime, I serve notice on the Ministry that I will be beating at Ministers' doors seeking justice for the forgotten flood victims of the central coast. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) remarked last week that there is nothing like defeat to concentrate a politician's mind on his own and his Party's shortcomings. I was fortunate enough to undergo the searing flame of the electorate's wrath and have the opportunity to spend two years contemplating just where we are going wrong. My road to Damascus turned out to be the railway between Woy Woy and Sydney. As a commuter I was able to listen for three hours each day to ordinary Australians expressing their views about politics, politicians and political parties. I was traumatised at the widespread cynicism, contempt and despair that I listened to and learned about on those journeys. Both politicians and their parties were seen to be out of touch, arrogant, unconcerned and incapable of understanding ordinary people's problems. There was an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The constant themes of complaints were that Australians had no real say in the decisions that were affecting their lives; that political corruption was institutionalised; and that faceless party bosses made all the real decisions. Opinion polls and qualitative research confirmed what I learned on that inter-urban express. The truth has long been staring us in the face. For some years in New South Wales the number of electors voting independent has been rapidly rising. In the 1988 State election seven independents actually won seats. The major political parties and their machines have been brushing this phenomenon aside for too long as a passing fad or aberration. The returns in the recent election demonstrate that naive viewpoint to be potentially politically suicidal. The reality is that the only safe seat in this House is now held by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack). </PARA>
<PARA> What do we, the people's representatives, do about this state of affairs? The first thing is to acknowledge its existence. Unfortunately there are some political ostriches who will not accept that the major parties have a massive problem. They will go the way of John Spender. There is a second group who, while acknowledging the problem, are convinced that it can be resolved with cosmetic surgery. They think that if we clean up our act in the Parliament and pour conciliatory messages into the ears of the disaffected, then they will come round and the independent revolt will go away. Those politicians do not understand the profound nature and extent of the electorate's alienation with the party and parliamentary system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the electorate would prefer us not to use unparliamentary language or behave like larrikins; but the gravamen of their criticism is that the party system has made Parliament a charade. The independent voters are not only looking for more open, accountable government; they want to be able to genuinely participate in our democracy. They want not only to be regularly consulted about major changes in the system but to feel that they have some say in the decision-making processes of the legislative and executive arms of government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I have reached the conviction that we need to completely review the mechanisms and procedures of this Parliament. Mind you, it is about time, because our current procedures were set in concrete in Tudor England. The passage of Bills in this place faithfully follows the forms of both Lords and Commons in 1510. Surely the time has come to break away from the thinking of the days of Cromwell and Henry VIII. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what has occurred in other Western democracies. Our American cousins have found ways to make their democracy more meaningful to their electorate. Many States have provisions for citizen initiated referenda, the right to recall public officials, more generous freedom of information laws, and meaningful consultative mechanisms. The time is ripe for politicians in Australia to begin to listen to those angry voices in their constituencies and to deliver some truly participatory democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that any such moves will present a terrible headache for us all. There could no doubt be embarrassing and enervating referenda on issues such as abortion, the death penalty, gun ownership and immigration. There will also be more constructive debates on issues such as road victims' rights, wildlife protection, nuclear power and cigarette smoking. However, all these problems and effort are preferable to the anarchy and instability of a parliament full of independents pursuing single issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an honour to represent the people of Robertson in this Parliament. It is a great pleasure to commence that service in the historic fourth term of the Hawke Labor Government. As a child of the Menzies era, it is for me a wonder and a joy to see Labor firmly entrenched on the treasury bench in Canberra with a decisive mandate and I look forward with enthusiasm to this Parliament implementing the ambitious but achievable agenda outlined in the Governor-General's Speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, firstly, may I congratulate the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) on his maiden speech in this House. Also, I join with others who have complimented you upon your election and wish us all good fortune in your deliberations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have noticed over the years that every newly-elected member of this House has claimed to represent an electorate so productive, so industrious and so full of potential that, were we to put merely one-third of them together, we would surely outproduce the Common Market, Japan and North America all at once. I can assure honourable members that my electorate is no different. </PARA>
<PARA> Before making this address, I would like to express my gratitude to the people of Barker for giving me what some of them regard as a narrow victory. I thank them for their trust and I can only hope that my efforts on their behalf will enable me in the future to turn it into a more respectable margin. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate of Barker is caressed on the northern and western sides by the gently meandering Murray River. It is battered and threatened on the south by the magnificent southern ocean and bounded on the east by the Victorian Labor Party. These contrasts of quality must be unrivalled in almost any equally irrelevant comparison. To make matters worse, the explorer and surveyor Captain Collett Barker was speared to death while swimming the mouth of the River Murray many years ago. There were no witnesses and there is thus no guidance for future incumbents of the seat which follows his name and which I now occupy as to whether he came to his doom trying to get into or out of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the catchment that refreshes our greatest river, the Murray-Darling Basin, is, as we know, an area of great seasonal contrasts-wild and unpredictable and, incidentally, very nearly the size of western Europe. Very few times in history do we have the chance to see such a clear painting of this enormous flood plain as the last few weeks have graphically, photographically and, in some cases, tragically depicted. The skies opened and filled the flat lands to the north with oceans of muddy water which will finally flow through the Darling and Lachlan river systems to the Murray and thence, of course, to the sea. It is a salutary thought that some of the water that is still in Queensland today will probably put the finishing touches to the wicket, which will put the finishing touches to Her Majesty's representatives, on the world's loveliest cricket ground, in Adelaide, some time next January. </PARA>
<PARA> This vast area, which currently provides Australia each year with $10 billion of valuable income, has been doing that for many years and that figure is an ever-increasing one. Over two centuries millions of people have been fed by its grain and clothed by its wool; sustained by its animals, its fruit and its wine. It is part of the resource which has enabled Australians to produce more food and fibre per farmer than anyone else in the world, and produce it cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to declare myself a countryman, a landsman affiliated to and essentially part of the farming and country community. I am, of course, not the first countryman to leave his farm and represent an electorate. However, I hope to make a somewhat more enthusiastic contribution than one of our great pioneers of last century, James Tyson, whom Banjo Paterson has immortalised in a poem that goes after Mr Tyson's name. He was persuaded at the age of 70 to accept a seat in the Legislative Council of Queensland in recognition of his contribution to Australia. Only once did he open his lips in that chamber. It was on a subject upon which he was an expert-the provisions of the marsupials Bill. He gave the House an exposition of the habits of pademelons and kangaroo rats, but the uncomprehending reporter transposed the names of these animals and Mr Tyson in disgust refused to run the risks of printer's ink again. There is, as some will know, a `single speech Hamilton' known to British history. In Australian politics Mr Tyson has gone down in posterity on the back of a single speech, misreported. </PARA>
<PARA> So one might ask: What is a countryman these days? What is a farmer? He belongs to a diminishing race in Australia, conservative by nature and less influenced by outside pressures than those in the cities. Perhaps that is because of the time it takes for these pressures to reach him and perhaps because much of the time he is working by himself. He is essentially a labourer who seldom votes Labor. He is, however, voluntarily a member of a farm organisation and, therefore, a member of a union of farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Until a few years ago he felt threatened by the size and apparent power of some trade unions. That threat is now somewhat diminished. He perceives that union leaders do not necessarily carry out the wishes of their members but sometimes operate a much more arbitrary decision-making process, and he therefore agrees with the 87 per cent of all Australians who want voluntary unionism today and the 82 per cent of unionists who want the same thing. He likes people to do things rather than talk about them and therefore he does not approve of some trade union officials and most politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> He no longer wants subsidies. He has watched with dismay as the Europeans and the Americans subsidised almost everything that moved, with the obvious result that quite a lot of it eventually did not. He realises that if he is being held up by public money he finally becomes inefficient and cannot compete. In any case, he knows that considering the size of the Australian Treasury today it cannot hold him up for long. He joins with the ordinary thinking Australian who wants to know why it is that since Federation a complex web of protection was developed in Australian manufacturing industries and why great disparities have evolved in the levels of protection between industries, which now favour some industries at the expense of others. </PARA>
<PARA> Together he and his thinking city counterpart wonder why this is still so when so many studies have shown that the cost to the community often far outweighs the benefits to the particular industry. Together they know that we have not done well in this discipline, in this international game, and they are looking for the reason. They want to know why we are inefficient, by any international measurement, on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> They are, however, somewhat reassured that now at last others-a few at least-are beginning to worry about the same things. Together they are starting to recognise, as the farmer understood some years ago, that no-one is going to pay for their mistakes, that Australia cannot be expected to nor can it pick up the cost of other people's failures regardless of whether they want it or not. They simply know it is not going to happen. The community, especially the agricultural community, knows that wonderful opportunities to provender a new Asian market will result if we can deliver our products there, high quality and on time. </PARA>
<PARA> The community knows, too, that the Murray-Darling Basin's enormously rich myriad of resources can yield some of that additional wealth and they worry that others seem to have lost sight of that fact and opportunity, confused by that much travelled debate on the environment. Indeed, other people-not the wise, but other people-are now debating, for example, a farmer's right to be on his land at all. Perhaps in the stampede to lock it up and leave it, some have overlooked entirely the evolutionary process of conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> These people hope that an increasing number of city and country people alike will at last become aware that there is a subtle but vitally important difference between preservation-that is, the process of protecting things from harm-and conservation, which is an evolutionary process, always changing, as ecology is always changing. It might, therefore, be properly defined as the management of an improving and evolving system which satisfies our needs and leaves the world in a state which will satisfy the needs of future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> If we accept this definition, conservation becomes the means by which we can choose to balance and manage this boundless country of largely unspoiled beauty. Quite simply, the community is just beginning, I believe, to understand that at the end of the day, when we have finished luxuriating in the debate, it will not be some centralised administration-for they have failed the world over-but rather those who have the greatest vested interest in conservation who will be its most vehement protagonists. </PARA>
<PARA> May I elaborate with just a few examples. Thinking people today want to know how it is that when conservators lock up our national parks they fail to deal with the greatest national soil care menace, the rabbit, that feral flora assassin which is estimated to be somewhere in the hundreds, if not thousands, of millions in this country today. They wonder, too, how it is that we profess to be so concerned about the management of our desert and dry lands but we fail to allow into Australia one man who has done more work on and probably knows more about the edible desert plants of the world just because he happens to be a white South African. How is it that others can talk about preservation of the environment and the malevolent damage that agriculture and mining are supposed to be doing when we have a burgeoning population to our north which in 40 years time will total between five and six billion people, have half the world's income, will require to be fed and provided with those raw materials and will not understand if we simply refuse to meet those requirements?</PARA>
<PARA> A growing number of people now want to know how it is that others can talk in this way when they must realise that to solve our environmental problems, for example, we actually need equipment made from the very minerals that those resources provide because, mundane though it may be, it is bulldozers, lasers, lime, tree planters and improved irrigation systems that will provide the answers. These same people are now having to reassure their perplexed children that, contrary to the opinions of some who would have us believe that our ecological doomsday is nigh, in fact the world will be here in 50 or 500 years time; that mining, farming, manufacturing and harvesting are good things to do and will still be generating a great deal of our nation's wealth for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> They say that if we can continue to manage the River Murray and this enormous system leading to it, using the best available technology-in the same way as the Americans are now managing the mighty Colorado-production can be maintained and improved at the same time as the quality of water, the soil and the riverine environment are conserved. If we can do those things, at the same time we can conserve much of Australia in the evolutionary sense that I have described today. </PARA>
<PARA> If those people happen to be lucky enough to live in the electorate of Barker they will know that, while our great river-the lifeblood of Barker-is not perfect, it can and will be repaired. It will not be repaired with biodegradable conferences of megapleuric dimensions, but with actions; not by turning a blind eye, but with vision. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not realise that it would be possible during a short election campaign to meet so many fine Australians of all ages and backgrounds and so many interesting people who are vitally concerned for the future of this country. Two special people remain particularly in my memory. Mrs Florence Patterson of Mount Gambier, who is now 93 years of age and was one of Winston Churchill's wartime secretaries, not only discussed in detail the affairs of this nation but also was able to recall with clarity her depressing task of reporting daily bomb damage to the British Prime Minister. As well, I had the great pleasure of talking to Mrs Alice Roberts of Singleton, New South Wales-a year older than Mrs Patterson and an equally concerned Australian whose husband, Trooper Jack Roberts, fought in the Boer War and was taken prisoner at Bloemfontein. Whichever way one looks at it, one can be assured that Trooper Roberts was a good deal older than his wife. They both talked about the individual freedoms and accomplishments of those early days, despite the hardships of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that liberty does not work as well in practice as it does in speeches, but most Australians are well aware of the great deal of basic freedom we have in this country. After all, we have our Australian version of freedom of speech, where anyone can call the highest in the land a fool. That particular freedom is not attempted many times by the ordinary citizen in public, but equally it is not ignored in private conversation-and I understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it would be totally inappropriate in a maiden speech. Fortunately, freedom of speech has been with us for a long time. It has its variations and it has created completely new categories of commentators; for example, some with whom we do not always agree. The American journalist Westbrook Pegler once observed, back in 1925:</PARA>
<PARA>Of all the fantastic fog-shapes that have risen off the swamp of confusion since the big war, the most futile and at the same time the most pretentious, is the deep-thinking, hair-trigger columnist or commentator who knows all the answers just off-hand and can settle great affairs with absolute finality three days or even six days a week. </PARA>
<PARA>The science has developed since then. Freedom of speech is perhaps the single greatest privilege which can be bestowed upon the citizens of any country, for it allows those citizens to transcend fear itself. Whilst I think the remembrance and the later remembrances of Gallipoli have restored some appropriate sanctity of the tragedies of war, we have, I would delicately suggest, lost many of the freedoms which our Gallipoli veterans and their families knew so well. It is not the basic freedoms so much that we have lost, but rather the lesser liberties which the ordinary citizen is losing-those liberties which people once assumed as normal, which today have been somewhat taken over by the crowd. </PARA>
<PARA> Have we lost, for example, the liberty to manage one's own affairs and not be overwhelmed by governments or government paper? I feel strongly about this issue, having been in this House for seven or eight days. Have we lost the liberty to have a feeling of belonging in our State or region and not be told those loyalties should disappear? Have we lost the freedom to work 60 hours a week and not be told we cannot, or the freedom for the young to be allowed to work at all and thus derive the satisfaction in those early days of walking home at the end of a long day, knowing that they can do it? Have we lost the freedom to export our goods unhindered, without someone else deciding for us whether we should be allowed to or not? Have we lost the liberty to remain a private citizen, or to walk the streets at night, or to grieve in private when things go wrong? And have we still got the freedom to join or not to join any organisation as a precursor to employment; the right to work or not to work, but not to complain, lest it interferes with the freedom of others. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise these matters just as an odd example of the way the crowd can steal the game; it is easy to justify-all in the interests of the team, they say. But if we fail to get the balance right, we take away the individuality, that early decision-making practice that is so essential, which enabled earlier Australians to conquer impossible odds. They did so because no-one had suggested to them that they should do, and no-one had suggested to them that they should think, otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> We can deal with these challenges best by allowing the natural ingenuity of our fellow Australians full rein. We can solve the challenges of the desert. We can deal with the inefficiencies of the workplace and the waterfront. The instruments of State must set the rules and the collective abilities of millions of Australians will carry us through. We will not be able to do these things if we take away the decision-making process of young Australians early in life. If you take away the liberty of making a decision, it is a removal of those basic liberties, freedoms-call them what you will-which I believe has stultified this country for far too long. Give them back and we will be on the way to success in the next millenium. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Address-in-Reply debate is one which enables members of the House to comment on the programs of the Government into the next three years as announced by the Governor-General and also deals with matters of concern without the limitations of second reading speeches or other forms of debate. The message delivered on behalf of the Government by the Governor-General sets out a program which, while difficult and ambitious, is also achievable. It continues a program of real action, of real achievement, and of actually tackling the problems in this country. This has been a hallmark of the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In congratulating the previous speakers, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), on their maiden speeches, I think it is essential to say that many of the problems that confront us now are problems which were developed by short-sightedness, opportunism and lack of any conception of the future by governments which remained in office too long and became tardy and lazy. Most nations which had the same level of advancement as Australia took great advantage from the developments immediately after World War II. Australia did until around 1950. A wool boom and the view of easy income without having to take hard decisions took over this country. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who believe, as the honourable member for Barker quite correctly pointed out, that a good deal of the structure of protection, taxes, and other aspects of our society are an ad hoc hotch-potch, they are correct. Anyone who believes otherwise might read the Coombs report on Government tax concessions and subsidies which was prepared during the period of the Whitlam Government. It showed just how widespread, ill-planned and irrelevant many of the assistance measures which had been introduced and forgotten about were. It shows that in many instances the assistance measures which were adopted had damaged rather than assisted the industries for which they were supposed to provide assistance or protection and, in fact, endangered whole industries. </PARA>
<PARA> By the mid-1970s, when competition was real and aggressive, many Australian industries had no capacity to compete. Whilst it is reasonable to suggest that in many areas padding, protection and, to some degree, the comfort of monopoly control has caused us material damage, the reality is that they developed at a time when people believed that all we had to do was shear sheep, kill cattle, dig holes in the ground, and then all of our economic problems would be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, running alongside that was the Leader of the Australian Country Party who was the greatest protectionist in the history of this country. Some of the measures, while popular with his contemporaries, proved disastrous in the longer term. By the end of the 1960s the 90 per cent car plan had developed an automobile industry in Australia which was uncompetitive. There was so little flexibility in the plan that it could not compete with the marketplace changes that swept the world. Australian manufacturers could not get into the four-cylinder car market because of the manner in which the 90 per cent plan was structured. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been remarkable change in that area, but it is slow. I think it will continue to be slow because of the high levels of investment that are involved and the time over which that investment has to be recovered by those making the investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The early days of this Parliament and, in fact, the colonies, saw the major political differences between protection and free trade, between New South Wales and Victoria. I do not think much has changed. The real political debates at the moment are over protection and free trade. Free trade is currently popular. However, there are not many Australians in the community who have had explained to them-nor has anyone really attempted to explain to them-what the benefits of reduced tariffs are if they work in a car factory or textile mill or, more importantly, if they used to work in a textile mill. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that there are benefits but I suggest that anyone who walks around any city in Australia which is dependent on protected industries and asks people in the street what benefits they will achieve if tariffs are halved or wiped out will not get many answers. There will be no answers because no-one has taken the trouble to explain what and where the benefits are that we are seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another factor which is equally important and totally ignored. For instance, if we determine that we will manufacture fewer motor vehicles in Australia-and I only use that as an example because my electorate has one of the biggest motor manufacturers in Australia, and it is not an unreasonable example-and if we reduce the cost of motor vehicles to consumers by one-third, by reducing tariffs and opening up international competition, what is to be the source of the increased foreign earnings to meet the cost of those imported vehicles?</PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we spend $550m a month importing television sets, videos, stereo sets and related equipment. Most were, at one time, manufactured in Australia: none are now. We spend nearly as much on items such as microwaves and refrigerator and washing machine motors, which used to be the basis of the South Australian economy-the whitegoods industry. We have not met the cost of those imports with exports to pay the bill, so we lose $1 billion a month, in round figures, buying goods which I am not sure are any cheaper, and which we used to manufacture in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries do not have a laissez faire policy or a free trade policy. Probably the most fraudulent trade policy in the world is that of the United States of America where total protection is the result of its inward looking Congress-even to the extent of almost dishonesty-whilst in the public forums of the world the United States says it wants trade opened up. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, there is no evidence of free trade in respect of Japan, the biggest trading nation in the world. Protection there may not be at a government level but it is certainly exercised by the trading companies that control the Japanese economy. How long has Australia battled to get its meat into the Japanese markets and how often have we had problems with access on technical grounds which are basically irrelevant? What is our prime beef classed as? Hamburger meat?</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the old trick of using quarantine, health and other forms of technical protection is not new to the Japanese; it applies between the Australian States too. But when we make decisions and decide that micro-economic reform means that we reduce tariffs, we ought at least to tell the people who run the risk of the total loss of all of their income and support without the prospect of replacement income or employment what the benefits will be in the longer term and how they will be achieved. At the moment we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear high sounding phrases from people who may or may not understand what they are saying but we very rarely hear someone told, `Your job will become redundant'. It happened to half the textile industry in the Geelong area between 1962 and 1963 and in the mid-1970s. People were told, `Your job will become redundant'. The lady who worked in those textile factories as a weaver supplementing the family income, which was low anyhow, stayed home when she became redundant. There was nowhere else to go. The industry disappeared. The income of the family was halved. No-one has yet explained to those people what the benefit was. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the reasons in the conventional wisdom for those plants closing was the correct one. I think there are all sorts of restrictive practices, and not the least of the problems was that we had a cosy arrangement whereby initiative was not required of management to compete in the marketplace. When competition arrived many of our plants were obsolete in the extreme and were unable to adapt to the change that took place. Many of the work practices which had been accepted by both sides did not allow for high levels of investment to modernise. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, it is not very long ago that we still had conditions where women were not allowed to work shift work. People cannot write off the cost of modern machinery by running it five days a week between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the afternoon. That problem ran into the 1970s. It is not a problem now but the places where those people worked do not exist now. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next three years Australians will face a difficult time. There are no easy or quick solutions to the problems that confront us. We are not earning sufficient to pay for the goods that we require. At the moment more than 50 per cent of the goods on the shelf in an ordinary supermarket are imported, and a good percentage of those available are no longer made in Australia. If that situation continues-and I think it will-we must make people understand what change is necessary, what benefit is available to them. It is not good enough to say that change is necessary because change for change's sake means nothing. If someone is asked to give up everything, as has been suggested in some policy pronouncements, without any guarantees that he or she will gain in the long term, then I think people are being asked more than they are entitled to be expected to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> The community is entitled to a little more than just superficial debate. It is entitled to a little more than a few high sounding phrases using economic jargon. What do we hear on our television sets almost every day? We are told that the dollar has gone up .1 of a cent or .2 of a cent, or whatever it is. That is on every news bulletin. They will soon get a glamorous young lady to do it because it is now as much a part of the news bulletin as the weather report-and they have blokes doing that now!</PARA>
<PARA> However, what relevance does this have for the ordinary Australian? For most Australians the movements between 76.4 and 76.5 are just numbers, like the temperature. They have very little relevance. Equally, we get stock exchange reports from Australia, New York, Japan and elsewhere on every news bulletin. These are not the things that Australians really need to know about. It would be nice if just occasionally the superficial was dropped and the real was set out-and that applies to all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the couple of moments I have left, I want to deal with one other matter-reform. I congratulated the honourable member for Robertson on his remarks, and the honourable member for Barker made similar remarks. Australia has a parliamentary system entrenched to model the British experience, with some modifications-the Senate being one of the more unfortunate ones; we would have been better off with a House of Lords. Australia has a political institution which is set in concrete at the stage of development of the British Parliament in the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA> Change requires that today's Australians have to vote for that change. The rate of success in this regard is not awfully good. Only two or three significant referenda have been carried since Federation, and there have been a number of minor technical changes. One was as to whether senators should take office on 1 January or 1 July. Another one was on the means by which we prevent another Field exercise. The significant changes involved the Loan Council arrangements, health and social services, and Aboriginal affairs. We have had two or three goes at having the election for the two Houses of Parliament on the same day. We have never yet managed that. We fail on two altars: State rights and senators' egos-or the egos of the Senate staff; I am not sure which. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that, if we are going to change significantly the way this Parliament operates and the way it presents itself, it will not be done by referenda. The State rights issues will not go away. They are as strong and vigorous-and as negative-as they ever were. They are a fact of political life in Australia. Those who talk loudest about change six months before a referendum usually turn up on the election hustings and oppose such change. </PARA>
<PARA> We can change the way this Parliament works, for the better, and I believe that we should radically change the internal arrangements. Parliament is remote from the majority of the population. It does not debate policy matters anywhere nearly as much as it should. The average member rarely participates in major debates. There was a time when it was different. There was a time when Federal responsibilities were far lower and therefore the pressure of Government business on the Parliament was much lower. I believe that the problem we have is that Government business dominates the Parliament. There is no way around that, unless we change the way in which we do business. The community has not had properly explained to it the manner in which we operate and the difficulties which confront us. Change can take place, but only if everyone is willing and, one might say, if some of the moss can be taken off some of the immovable stones that seem to dominate this place, even though the bodies change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me begin by congratulating you, sir, on your election. I also put on record my congratulations to the Speaker on his re-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The late Sir Arthur Fadden, the very first member for McPherson, said these words in 1937:</PARA>
<PARA>We are living in quickly changing times which demand considerable modifications . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As he spoke of changing times Australia was poised on the brink of the Second World War. The situation has changed and these, thankfully, are peaceful times, but the message could still be the same. We face different threats. Australia is poised precariously now between a future of prosperity and a future of mediocrity, or worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Many speakers in this debate have already alluded to the serious economic problems we face: record high interest rates; inflation; overseas debt out of control; rising unemployment; low labour productivity; and so on. I do not intend to say more. I simply make the observation that no-one on this side of the House-and I suspect very few outside-takes very seriously the assurances of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that everything is on track. As one of my constituents observed the other day, `How can Mr Keating appear to be so pleased that I am going broke?'. The soft landing that the Treasurer has referred to so often increasingly looks like the elusive J-curve that has not lived up to its expectations. </PARA>
<PARA> The first member for McPherson, as I mentioned previously, was the late Sir Arthur Fadden, a man who became a legend in his own time. With the founder of our Party, Sir Robert Menzies, he was co-architect of the conservative coalition. His political record is virtually unsurpassed. The first and only Queenslander to become Prime Minister-an office he held for 40 days and 40 nights at the height of World War II-he was Treasurer for 11 Budgets, Deputy Prime Minister for 10 years and Leader of the Country Party for an incredible 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Arthur Fadden's successor, Charles Barnes, held the seat for 14 years and was Minister for Territories for five years. Following Mr Barnes was the first Liberal to represent McPherson, Mr Eric Robinson, who was also a Minister for five years. Eric was a successful businessman who believed in liberalism and was highly respected within the Party. We are reminded of Eric every time we step off the tarmac upon arrival at Coolangatta Airport and we enter the Eric Robinson terminal. Finally my predecessor, Peter White, who was shadow Minister for defence and previously sport, recreation and tourism for a number of years. Peter was elected in 1981 upon the untimely death of Eric Robinson. Peter has gained an enormous amount of respect and esteem from constituents, Party members and colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> These, Mr Deputy Speaker, are former members whose public concern was the hallmark of their long service in parliament. I hope while I am here to emulate both the quality and the longevity of their terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to all the Party members and supporters who dedicated a great deal of effort to my election campaign. To my family and especially my wife Judy, who is in the gallery today, I would like to say a special thank you. Public life makes great demands on families as well, but I am confident in the knowledge that my family supports me 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> McPherson currently has the largest number of electors of any seat in Australia with 88,000 voters and a total permanent population of over 140,000. In the past five years the population has increased by a staggering 32 per cent. Added to this is a visiting population which exceeded two million visitors in 1988-89. The last figure, of course, is not so surprising when one considers that McPherson encompasses Surfers Paradise, the heart of Australia's tourist capital, the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the tourist industry is the life and breath of the Gold Coast and it, along with other places, is still trying to recover after the crippling airline dispute. At the height of the dispute Gold Coast hotel operators were losing $1m a day in cancelled business conventions alone. Small business proprietors and especially retailers suffered the worst trading figures in many years. It is a travesty that an industrial dispute of such magnitude was not resolved sooner. The effects are still being felt and I fear that many businesses will never recover. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the greatest asset that the Gold Coast tourist industry has cannot be measured in dollars. It is its beautiful environment. The electorate is physically framed by the best and cleanest beaches in Australia, clean air and the unique hinterland of the Springbrook National Park which covers 2,695 hectares. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic threat I referred to earlier almost pales when we consider the other great challenge of the 1990s which has been referred to so often in this House recently, that is, the preservation of the increasingly threatened environment. I believe I share with most Australians a burgeoning awareness of the fragility of the environment and as the father of two small children I am deeply concerned, especially with the preservation of the environment for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales Premier Nick Greiner's Earth Day statement provides what has been acknowledged by many to be a workable blueprint for dealing with the tension between safeguarding environmental interests and economic growth. The Gold Coast is certainly threatened by the prospect of over-development. I believe it is important that this does not happen. Fortunately, I believe we have a number of responsible developers who realise they risk spoiling the very thing that makes the Gold Coast so attractive if the environment is abused. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that I am not telling you anything if I say that the Gold Coast is beautiful one day and perfect the next and I would like it to stay that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to note in the eloquent maiden speech last week of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) a glowing endorsement of the contribution small business makes to the creation of wealth in this nation. While extravagant entrepreneurs and media barons make the headlines as their fortunes tumble, it is the thousands of small business and retail operators who provide employment for 50 per cent of the nation's private sector work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General in his speech referred to the recent House of Representatives committee report on small business in Australia, the so-called Beddall report. I was particularly pleased to note His Excellency's statement that the Government is giving high priority to developing a full response to the report's recommendations. I would like to congratulate the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) on his appointment. He now has the unique opportunity of implementing legislation to follow up the very good work that his committee did. </PARA>
<PARA> As National Director of the Shopping Centre Tenants Association of Australia, I made a submission to the inquiry and I am now pleased to note that the committee in its wisdom saw fit to adopt many of the suggestions that I made to it. Chapter four of the committee's report deals with trade practices and tenancy matters. The committee has recommended that the provisions of the Trade Practices Act concerning unconscionable conduct, that is section 52A, which currently applies to transactions involving consumers, be extended to include small business transactions including retail and commercial tenancy agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee has also recommended the provision of greater resources to the Trade Practices Commission so as to ensure the services and support it is able to provide to small business are strengthened and not diminished. I know that the Opposition supports this course of action. The committee has also recommended that the Treasurer and the Australian Taxation Office undertake an immediate review of taxation compliance and reporting requirements with a view to reducing and simplifying these for small business. </PARA>
<PARA> One taxation matter which is of vital concern to small business is the committee's recommendation that the capital gains tax be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another. I shall be watching with great interest to see whether the Government acts on these and other practical and sensible recommendations outlined in the Beddall report. </PARA>
<PARA> As a private pilot, I am aware of many of the concerns of the general aviation industry, particularly of a number of operators at Coolangatta Airport. The past 12 months in particular have been very difficult for this small business sector. The Civil Aviation Authority has an extremely difficult task, as it endeavours to move to full cost recovery in a shrinking market; but it cannot look to the general aviation industry to prop up unwarranted and inefficient services. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of airports, I might say, as a commercial passenger who has frequented Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in recent years and will continue to do so in transit to Canberra, what a fiasco that has become. Delays into and out of Sydney have become endemic. Not only is it wasting millions of dollars of fuel but also it is wasting an enormous amount of time for busy people sitting in aircraft holding around Sydney or on the tarmac. Some delays are no doubt due to the antiquated equipment that the air traffic controllers are forced to work with, but there is no excuse, in my view, for the inordinate amount of time taken to complete the environmental impact study into the third runway proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue of concern to both the people of McPherson and me is the question of foreign investment and the extent of overseas land ownership. I find myself, quite surprisingly, in agreement with the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker). Having known him during his career in the New South Wales Parliament, I do not expect to be in agreement with him on many occasions, but I am today on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has relied on a massive inflow of foreign money to sustain our living standards. A substantial part of consumption and investment activity since 1983 has been financed by foreign debt. This debt has generally not been used to establish new wealth producing industries, particularly export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party believes that foreign growth has been essential for the Australian economy to grow. However, I suggest there is a greater need for stricter controls and guidelines, especially in respect of investment which flows into foreign ownership. In my view, we should not allow the sale of freehold property to overseas investors. If we continue to do so, we will further mortgage our children's future. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Robert Birrell, senior lecturer in the Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Monash University, makes some very interesting comparisons between Australia and Sweden. Sweden has achieved a high standard of living under a welfare state system. It is a small country with only 8.3 million people which has flourished in a competitive international environment. The Swedes appear to have taken seriously the policies which the Australian Government now gives lip service to. Labour productivity in Sweden is at a much higher level than it is in Australia. In Sweden, neither politicians nor unions have been afraid of structural adjustment. The Swedes are also heavily committed to research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, is a world renowned research body which is constantly seeking increased government funding and struggles to meet the private funding quota. We have the technological acumen right here in Australia. What we appear to lack is the aggressive business sense and the necessary labour market reforms to make Australia competitive as an international trading nation. Australia's low per capita growth performance is largely attributable to its poor record of growth in labour productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's enthusiasm for the proposed multifunction polis (MFP) is further evidence of its preparedness to allow a further build-up of Australia's massive foreign debt. I believe that we should be looking at what we can do for ourselves as a nation, rather than what others can do for us. One of the sites for the proposed MFP borders my electorate. The MFP, as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, was first proposed by Mr Tamura, the former Japanese Minister for International Trade and Industry, at the Australian-Japanese ministerial committee meeting in January 1987. Senator Button expressed great interest and has on a number of occasions since in advancing the proposal. There are in my mind many unanswered questions about the MFP, such as who will really live there, who will pay for the extra facilities needed to service a community of 200,000 people and, more importantly, what benefits will be derived from it for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor David Yencken of the School of Environmental Planning at the University of Melbourne, in his social issues study on the MFP commissioned for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, sets out the implications and considerations for MFP planners of the social effects of a new town development and a mixture of cultures which would occur in an international city. Professor Yencken observes in his report that the Japanese, as instigators of the polis proposal and as the dominant economic group in the region, are likely to have a more prominent place in the polis than any other international group. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, Professor Yencken says that Japan and Australia are likely to have different primary objectives for the polis. I believe this was strongly brought out last night in the Four Corners program. Professor Yencken also observes that there could be serious obstacles to Japanese adaptation to Australian society. Further, the treatment of foreigners inside Japan is far from generous and there is a need for reciprocal arrangements for Australian nationals in Japan to match any arrangements for the Japanese in the polis. Understandably, the Australian Government is not particularly pleased with Professor Yencken's comments. As I understand it, it was originally reluctant to publish his findings. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), as Leader of the Opposition during the election campaign, rightly, in my view, expressed concern about the MFP, both because of its potential to be an enclave and also on economic grounds. My own careful reading of the economic assessment of the MFP carried out by Anderson Consulting also leads me to the conclusion that on the figures presented the MFP would have a negative impact on our trade balance for the next 20 years. There is, in my view, an important need for the whole MFP concept to be given much greater detailed consideration before it proceeds much further. </PARA>
<PARA> His excellency, in his Speech, also make mention of immigration and ethnic affairs and of the Government's commitment to ensuring that its immigration policy remains relevant to Australia's needs. The same Professor Yencken in his report on the MFP observes, correctly I believe, that most Australians would prefer a lower level of migration, but they tolerate migration as a seemingly necessary part of Australian development. I am pleased that immigration is back on the political agenda, and this has been confirmed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time here to develop the debate at all, except to say that there are clearly two sides to the question, and the important thing is that the issue of immigration, which has very real economic and social repercussions, deserves to be thoroughly analysed and debated at this time. If one criticises the proponents of immigration, one runs the risk of being branded as anti-immigration or worse. The important thing, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we must decide what is in the best interests of the future of Australia and Australians and not merely stand by and allow things to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to conclude by putting my remarks in this speech into a personal context. My own ethos and political philosophy have been shaped by two main factors. Firstly, my late father was a director of the Australian subsidiary of a large American multinational corporation. He got there and stayed there by working hard, and he set for me and my brothers a very fine example. </PARA>
<PARA> The second factor that I would like to mention here is that I became a Christian at a very young age. My parents were not at that time regular church attenders, but they did me a great service by sending me to Sunday school. Nothing in the intervening years has caused me to doubt that step of faith I took when I was 12 years old. For me, the prayers which are said at the beginning of each parliamentary day are significant and meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am proud to be Australian and I am proud to have been chosen to serve my constituents and my country. I want my children to grow up as I did, realising how fortunate they are to live in this wonderful country, but not being complacent about it. I conclude where I began: these are changing times and they demand considerable modification. I am looking forward to playing a role in shaping the future of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to reflect on and advise the House in relation to the financial position of the State of Tasmania and also to advise the House in relation to conduct of the previous Liberal Administration which I believe has placed the good management of the State of Tasmania at severe risk. It is important, in terms of responding to the Governor-General's Speech, to look at lessons that can be learnt from other jurisdictions, other States, because when we look at Tasmania we see reflected in the way the Liberal Administration conducted its affairs over eight years, before it was defeated by the Field Administration, an object lesson in how not to manage the affairs of a State. It reflected a complete disregard for the good stewardship of the State, a contempt for the people and a willingness to bleed Tasmania of much needed resources to keep funding levels and expenditure high against the hope of winning an election, but not looking to the long term and to the long term interests of those who live in Tasmania. It also showed a complete disrespect, particularly in the manner of its leaving office, to constitutionalism and the rule of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer firstly to the economic circumstances. We are now facing a situation in Tasmania where the net debt accumulated over eight years by the previous Liberal Administration will present such an enormous problem for our State that major initiatives will be needed in terms of savage budgetary reaction by the new State Government. It is a problem not of the Field Government's making, and it has been brought about by a change in financing of the State's ordinary operations, from revenue collected through mechanisms such as revenue generation from its own tax base, to funding ongoing recurrent expenditure from borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the total State debt which is the most alarming statistic-that itself is large, $1.5 billion at 30 June 1989-but rather the way in which the components of that State debt were changed by the previous Liberal Government. We have seen essentially a transfer of borrowings from those areas which had a capacity to repay-for example, the Hydro Electric Commission and other State statutory authorities-to support merely for the general administration and ordinary running of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem with that is that it has replaced a set of borrowing prescriptions which had a capacity to generate an income stream so that the borrowings could be repaid with mere Budget support to the State itself. If one looks at the effect, the difference is that if there is the positive income flow we get offsetting recoveries, whereas if we merely support direct government expenditure, we do not. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1979 and 1980 two-thirds of the total State debt was held by statutory authorities-90 per cent of that by the Hydro Electric Commission and water authorities and one-third by the Tasmanian Government. Ten years later the situation was turned around. As a result, although there was a small reduction in total State debt, that was possible only through massive real term reductions in the debt held by statutory authorities. At the same time, there has been a real terms increase in the debt held by the Tasmanian Government. The effect of that is that there has been a reduction in interest recoveries-money coming back-and a real terms increase in the interest payments going directly out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund on behalf of the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is this so? Why did that happen? The simple answer is that the previous Liberal Administration mortgaged the future. It was unprepared to take the hard decisions that needed to be taken to adjust the Tasmanian Budget to reflect the changed economic circumstances it was facing. It continued to spend money which it knew was not available in the long term and ran itself into an election which it hoped to win and then turn around and impose massive cuts later upon a bemused and bewildered public that had been conned by this massive confidence trick. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in that strategy was that there was a turn in public opinion in the State, unanticipated by the Gray Government, which, having provoked some domestic areas of controversy, was itself taken by surprise by the results of the election. As a result, Tasmania is now governed by a Labor Administration, but crippled with the legacy of the Liberal mismanagement of the State's financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The net debt servicing cost, as a percentage of total recurrent receipts, has risen from 4.7 per cent in 1980 to 9.8 per cent in 1990, from the Treasury estimates, and without remedial action it will grow to 12.5 per cent in 1992 and around 14 per cent in 1995. Obviously, this simply cannot be sustained. The magnitude of the State's debt, left to it by the politically opportunistic manoeuvrings of the previous Liberal Administration, is only now becoming fully known to the people of our State. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Treasury reports, which reveal the magnitude of the debt, are the first insight that the people of Tasmania have had into the way in which the previous Gray State Government was unprepared to respond to the necessities of reducing its expenditure-cutting its cloth to meet the money available. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is true that Tasmania, like all other States, has suffered real term reductions from the Commonwealth. That, of course, is the base root of my criticism because, notwithstanding that Tasmania had special treatment from the Commonwealth, which injected many millions of dollars into Tasmania by way of specific project grants, some of which I have had the pleasure to be associated with over the past 2 3/4 years-notwithstanding many such special projects that the Commonwealth has involved itself in to assist Tasmania-and notwithstanding that at the Premiers Conferences the Prime Minister has repeatedly given Tasmania greater assistance than the Grants Commission had recommended, the Gray Government failed to grasp the nettle of financial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Field Government fully accepts the rationale for Budget restraint the Federal Government has taken over recent years and accepts that expenditure cuts will need to be made in its Budgets; but what it naturally finds difficult to accept is that it will have to achieve in the next three years expenditure cuts which should have been planned for and gradually introduced over the past eight years. We have been left with a decade's work to be done in three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would imagine that in ordinary circumstances that would lead to the total erosion of confidence in the former Administration. The fact is that it has now been publicly revealed that the management of the State's Budget over the period of the Gray Government was so deceitful and so politically opportunistic. I would have thought that in most political systems that would have led the leader of that system-disgraced and now leading the Opposition-to contemplate resignation; but not so in Tasmania, where people are made of tougher stuff, at least in the case of the hide of the former Premier, Robin Gray. Not only was he surprised by the timing of his going; he surprised us by his contempt for the democratic process in the manner of his going. </PARA>
<PARA> He had already demonstrated a disrespect for constitutionalism with respect to the operations of this Parliament by refusing to replace a Labor senator with a nominee of the Australian Labor Party. Senator Devereux, who subsequently won an election, was initially refused nomination to the other place in this Parliament by reason of Gray's intransigent opposition to what he held to be the views of then Mr John Devereux, but now Senator Devereux, in relation to the environment, views which are now taken as mainstream and accepted right through the political community in both parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding that first display of contempt for constitutionalism, during the period following the election, when it was plain that the Liberals no longer had command of the House of Assembly and held only 17 seats out of a 35-seat parliament, Gray's behaviour demonstrated contempt for the processes of constitutionalism and what we would normally regard as the rule of law. He sought to whip up extra-parliamentary opposition to the pact that was negotiated between the Labor Party and the five Independent members of the House of Assembly to bring pressure upon the Governor to reject the properly proffered constitutional advice from the Leader of the Opposition, who informed the Governor that sufficient members would give him support in the Parliament so that he might form a government. </PARA>
<PARA> The defeated Government sought to subvert the ordinary process of constitutionalism, which of course is that the side which wins the greatest number of seats in the election is entitled to govern, by seeking to bring about all kinds of direct actions by front organisations to stir up an overhead atmosphere of political controversy and at the same time spent large amounts of taxpayers' moneys seeking advice from any constitutional lawyer that might conceivably be tempted to put something in the way of a caveat on the basis of the proposition that he ought to tender his resignation to the Governor. </PARA>
<PARA> We still have not seen published the advice so obtained. Of course, no respectable constitutional lawyer could have even toyed with the kinds of propositions that Mr Gray was seeking support for. I say `no respectable lawyer'; I understand the former member for Denison toyed briefly with support for such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the situation then emerged that the climate of opinion in our State was so overheated that obviously people took steps which in ordinary circumstances they would not have. If I can turn to what I think is one of the greatest tragedies and most salutary lessons that we can reflect upon-that is, the attempted bribery of the member for Bass in the State Parliament so that he might cross the floor and continue to support a Liberal Administration-I note that in the speech in mitigation delivered by his counsel following Mr Rouse's plea of guilty, Mr Hedigan, representing Mr Rouse, said, `Mr Rouse looks upon the events of that time with something of an air of disbelief as to what it was that possessed him to seek to achieve his ends in that way'. So do we all; but, of course, in the climate of those times, that overheated atmosphere, whipped up in complete contempt of the process of democracy and the obligations of parliamentary government and constitutionalism, it is hardly surprising that those kinds of actions were provoked. I say `hardly surprising', but it is always a surprise when we are faced with actions which seek to subvert the course of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that now arises in relation to the Rouse matter is what should now follow. It is plainly too early to take any step by way of a royal commission or a commission of inquiry into those events, because two trials are yet to be decided; that relating to Mr McQuestin and that relating to Mr Aloi, both of whom were charged in relation to those matters. Of course, each is entitled to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. It seems, however, that there may be issues which are left unresolved even after those trial processes. Already the Hobart Mercury has called for a royal commission.</PARA>
<PARA> In a very provocative article headed `Gray areas in bribe case need clarification' in the Weekend Australian, Tasmania's leading political commentator, Bruce Montgomery, pointed to a series of questions which need a response. In particular, Bruce Montgomery points to a series of answers which were given by the former Premier, Robin Gray, to the media at the time the bribery attempt was first made public and contrasted them with statements he has made recently in public in relation to those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In interviews with the media recently, Mr Gray has confirmed that he had four conversations with Mr Rouse prior to the matter of the bribery attempt becoming public. Of course, at the time he made no mention of those conversations to any of the journalists that interviewed him. As Mr Montgomery says, the June 1989 and May 1990 statements paint a very different picture of Mr Gray's level of awareness. Why did Mr Gray not mention to journalists in June that Mr Rouse had been in touch? Why did he never ask Mr Rouse, particularly on 21 June, the identity of the defector? We have to remember in relation to this matter that the evidence before the court was that the offer of money to Cox had been on the basis that he would approach Gray himself. </PARA>
<PARA> These questions obviously are still very much at large in the Tasmanian community. It seems peculiar that a man who was desperately hanging on to power, who was prepared to spend taxpayers' money to obtain legal opinion of any kind to support his failing claims to the premiership, who had whipped up an emotional storm in the Tasmanian community, would not have asked, in relation to a conversation with the State's leading business person who had informed him that a member of the Labor Party was about to defect, who that member might be, not sought any further information, and indeed said, `I don't want to know about it'. That seems palpably implausible. </PARA>
<PARA> If we put it in the context of imagining a hung parliament at the recent Federal election and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) being rung up by someone who said, `Look, there is a Liberal who is anxious to cross the floor and join your Government; he may accept an offer of a speakership or a ministry', I would have anticipated that it might have passed the Prime Minister's mind to at least inquire who that person was and to say, `Look, let's talk about it'. No crime is involved in that; that is part of politics. There is nothing improper in that process. But Mr Gray made no such inquiries, sought no such information, did not want to know about it. It does not sound plausible. </PARA>
<PARA> After all these matters are looked at and the new trials are completed, if these loose ends are not resolved, I too will join with the chorus of voices in the Tasmanian community which say, `We need to get to the bottom of this matter; it is impossible to live comfortably with a situation in which we allow the attempted subversion of the State, the democratic processes of our parliamentary process, and leave loose ends hanging'. None of us would wish that and I am sure that the same would be echoed by honourable members on both sides of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of my sister, Mrs Rosemary Robertson, and my mother.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a great honour to have been elected as the member for Goldstein, and by the biggest majority for many years in the area now covered by the electorate. I want to record particularly my great pleasure at the support given to my campaign by migrant Australians who as individuals are deeply committed to the ideals of the family and freedom of enterprise which the Liberal Party supports. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to take this opportunity to reaffirm the commitment I made to the electors of Goldstein during the campaign: that I will do all in my power to be a voice for their concerns, and to bring about the critical reforms without which Australia must continue to decline relative to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of the recent election reveals Australians to be a troubled people, uncertain of where their country is heading. Australians are casting about for solutions to a mounting host of problems. In the public debate, the economic problems predominate; but in their turn these are feeding crises-whose roots are only partly economic-in our public services, health, education, provision for the aged, and family breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view these problems have their roots in a neglect of certain basic values and principles. They bespeak a loss of vision, a confusion of purpose-and they will be solved only when that sense of vision and purpose is restored. The values whose relevance we need to understand are values of freedom and responsibility, democracy and justice. They are values which inspire my own participation in politics, and to the greater achievement of which I will devote myself in the years ahead. These are not just abstract ideals. Freedom, responsibility, democracy and justice are the blood and guts of politics. They are what politics is all about. They drive Australian politics today, as in different ways their pursuit drives the politics of the world. They are always under challenge and always relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I start by referring to the relevance of those values for the way in which we regard and treat our institutions. This chamber, this Parliament itself, is one of the great achievements of the struggle to put those ideals into practice. We should always remember we who are here today did not create this Parliament; we inherited it. In its procedures and its rituals it records the outcomes of courageous struggles of the past to establish liberty and democracy, and the efforts of people whose names we should recall from time to time in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> If we in Australia have not suffered from domestic turmoil and tyranny as others in the world have suffered this century, it is not because we are wiser or cleverer than other peoples, but because we are the beneficiaries of the courage and vision of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Isaac Newton wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>If I have seen further than [other men], it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants. </PARA>
<PARA>In politics, too, we stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before. We should remember in this place the fight of Peter Wentworth and his successors in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for freedom of speech; of Chief Justice Edward Coke for the independence of the judiciary; of John Hampden and those who followed in the seventeenth century for the right of the people's representatives to control taxation; of all those who, in 1689, established the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. We record in the wording of our own Constitution the vision of Thomas Jefferson and his great colleagues in the United States who first wrote the words, `We the people . . .'. And let us not forget Alfred Deakin, one of the greatest of the founding fathers of our federation. </PARA>
<PARA> The traditions and symbols of this Parliament recall that history for us-and, because that is worth while, we should preserve those traditions. We need to care for our institutions, and hand them on to future generations so that they will become stronger and more vital than ever. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some emphasis these days-at least in some States-on teaching our children about the relevance of gender, ethnicity and class. We must never forget that the most precious things we have to hand on are our institutions, such as parliament and the judiciary, and principles such as the separation of powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The decline of standards in the Parliament has been highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The preference to speak in other forums and the decline in concepts of ministerial responsibility reveal a disregard for the institution of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The growing strength of the committee system of this chamber on the other hand is a development of great promise and, as those committees extend their independence from the Executive, the greater will their contribution be. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit that I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, to see that you do not sit in the chair which was given to this Parliament at its foundation by friends in the United Kingdom, because that chair is one of those symbols, and one that speaks clearly of the debt we owe, and should not be too proud to own. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not make the grave mistake that it is more democratic, more modern, to do away with reminders of the past. The world has suffered greatly this century because of the arrogant belief that we can dispense with tradition and rebuild societies according to current fashion, and democracy has suffered as a result of that arrogance. </PARA>
<PARA> This new Parliament assembles at an historic moment. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union exposes for all of history to come the great fallacy that the lives of the people can be bettered by re-engineering the social order according to the ideology and the limited understanding of a few. Never has there been an historical experiment which has revealed more clearly the limitations of central power to construct the good society. Let us be blunt: the fallacy of the socialists-their great error-was that economic freedom was only of benefit to the few, the powerful few. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth that is now revealed by the historic events through which we are living is that freedom is for the many. Freedom is the greatest possession of the people themselves. It is the few who benefit from the destruction of freedom and the many who suffer. As Hazlitt said:</PARA>
<PARA>The love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I am proud to acknowledge in this chamber the work of my father, Charles Kemp, who, through the Institute of Public Affairs Review, worked to keep alive the ideal of free enterprise at a time when the adherents of the centrally planned economy were at the peak of their influence. I regret that he cannot be here today because he is in hospital recovering from an illness. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure there will now be many on the other side of the chamber who would agree that Australia would be a very different-and poorer-country had the nationalisation of the banks succeeded. I hope it will never be forgotten in our history that the Liberal Party fought the good fight against socialism and its extremist version-communism. And let me say that in doing so it was fighting on the side of the people against those who would tyrannise over them. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert Menzies, at the foundation of the Liberal Party, identified clearly the reasons why socialism would fail when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Socialism means high costs, inefficiency, the constant intrusion of political considerations, the damping down of enterprise, the overlordship of routine. None of these elements can produce progress, and without progress security will turn out to be a delusion. </PARA>
<PARA>With the benefit of hindsight we can see that he was right. Socialism collapsed because it could not innovate. Throughout their history the socialist societies were parasitic on the West for technology. They could attract Western enterprise to establish steel and tractor plants, build hydro-electric installations and by industrial espionage draw on the creative powers of capitalism; but the laser, the micro-processor, the photocopier and the computer finally pushed the West into a new age which left socialism far behind. </PARA>
<PARA> Those whom Winston Churchill called the shamefully abused peoples of eastern Europe are now reclaiming the prized possession of personal responsibility for their own lives. The inevitable disruption of reform they have seen as preferable to the material stagnation, the demoralisation of the politicised society, the corruptions of centralised power. Their new leaders proclaim the necessity for the rule of law, constitutionalism, private property, free markets and representative parliamentary government. They are labouring to construct the institutions we take for granted. Because they do not have the history that we are fortunate to have, their task will not be easy nor accomplished in a short time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tempting now to turn on its head Edward VII's phrase that `we are all socialists nowadays' and to say `we are all liberals now'-liberals in the sense that it is now recognised on all sides of politics that government must withdraw from excessive intervention; that productivity and growth can be driven only by giving people the right to decide how they will organise the workplace, the enterprise, for themselves; that national prosperity is advanced by giving people greater freedom to invest their money, and to practice their trade or profession where they will. </PARA>
<PARA> I say `tempting' because there remain very substantial differences of view across this chamber. Too often the phrase `micro-economic reform' is used to justify any action of government publicly promoted as an effort to build economic activity, even if that action involves extensive bureaucratic intervention and direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate by reference to education and research. There is probably no field of human activity which shows more clearly the importance of freedom as a basic organising principle than scientific research. This is so whether we are talking about research conducted under the umbrella of academic freedom within universities, or under the umbrella of freedom of enterprise in the commercial or industrial world. </PARA>
<PARA> A very large degree of freedom to pursue research and establish property in its products is essential to provide researchers with the motivation, the incentive, to draw fully on their experience and training and to maximise the opportunities for creativity. There are few fields more competitive than science. </PARA>
<PARA> When the research effort is tightly constrained by centrally determined `national priorities', when the research environment is subject to constant uncertainty and disruption, when governments increasingly seek to determine how research will be managed, creativity can be stultified and innovation harmed. These risks are currently being incurred in Australia and I simply note the recent comment of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that the research infrastructure of higher education in this country is being damaged by unwise government intervention-intervention which is justified as micro-economic reform, but is in reality forced restructuring according to government whim. </PARA>
<PARA> Genuine micro-reform is not based on establishing systems where leaders in any field must compete for government favours, for access to government, for the power to influence government decisions. Genuine micro-reform means that government must give people the freedom within a framework of just laws and market processes to compete with each other in offering the best product and the best service. Genuine micro-reform does away with the need for government or its agent to be always at the table as the most powerful decision-maker. It brings government back to its proper role not as the biggest, toughest player, but as the maker of the rules, the adjudicator of fairness, the umpire of the game, and the guardian of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, there still remain in this Parliament clear differences on this question of the role of government. While government has thankfully given up on the illusion that it can, by central direction and minute regulation, produce prosperity, the illusion still persists that government can do this if it works through negotiation with a few powerful interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We must constantly be on our guard against democracy degenerating into rule by pressure group, and against confusing the voices of the leaders of pressure groups with the voice of the people. Excessive power for special interests damages both freedom and democracy, for the clamour of pressure groups is all too frequently for privilege, and privilege commonly means restricting the freedom of others, and gaining special access to government above and beyond what democratic principles could justify. </PARA>
<PARA> The voices we must hear, alongside the voices of those who organise on their own behalf, are the voices of the non-organised-the real taxpayers, the real consumers, the real small businesses, the teachers in the classroom, the workers on the factory floor, and the vast numbers of non-organised Australians who are concerned about a balanced position on the environment. These are the people who have carried the burden of Australia's decline. </PARA>
<PARA> So much of the regulation we now recognise as excessive is regulation introduced in response to demands from the regulated interests. Much of the regulation of trade and industry, of the professions, of education, and above all of the labour market, is of such a kind. Frequently this regulation is designed to prevent competition and sustain monopoly. Governments which are prepared to grant great privileges to some do so too often at the expense of those freedoms to which all are entitled and on which our prosperity ultimately depends. </PARA>
<PARA> The phrase that is sometimes used to describe what is happening now is `the corporate state'. The corporate state likes concentrations of power. It actively fosters them-in the labour market, in business, in education, among students-and every lobby or special interest is encouraged to nominate its national leaders with whom the Government can deal. But has it aided reform?</PARA>
<PARA> Corporatism has not dealt with reform of the labour market; it has run away from the privatisation of public sector monopolies and the prospect of giving workers the opportunity to become shareholders in their own enterprise. It is tightening rather than relaxing central controls which are damaging Australia's higher education, while readily supporting their absorption into the centralised industrial relations system, and allowing union pressures to dominate the needed reforms of our school systems. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fashionable view in some educational circles today that justice and equity forbid the recognition that some subjects are harder than others, that some students are better than others at these subjects, that parity of esteem requires minimising the differences in the results students achieve and that competitiveness as a spur to achievement is undesirable. I say it is unjust not to recognise the unique and different abilities of students, not to allow them to reach for the highest attainments of which they are capable, and inequitable not to record their success. False concepts of equity can only lead to the destruction of standards and the demoralisation of students. Students will hold in contempt any education system which does not provide them with worthwhile challenges. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issues are: How are we going to once more make teaching a profession of high standing which will attract, hold and adequately reward those of talent and dedication? How are we to ensure that the curriculum is one which will inspire and open new vistas for our young people and encourage them to excellence? How are we going to provide the best opportunities for the nation's researchers? Having worked with students for many years, I am convinced that an important part of the answer is to give much more weight to students' and parents' own choices in allocating resources, and much greater freedom to educational institutions to respond to these choices. The healthy competition between institutions which a stronger educational market controlled by the demand of students and parents would promote, would do much more to raise the quality and standing of teaching and research and expand opportunity than the current debilitating competition for bureaucratic favours. </PARA>
<PARA> No technique of government which is based on the view that the concentration of power is desirable, that big is better, that the key decisions should be taken by officials is ultimately compatible either with democracy or with prosperity. More politics is not the solution to our economic and social problems. The solution is in less politics and more direct decision-making by people themselves-more freedom for people to assume responsibility for managing a business, organising their school, establishing a training program or setting up a child-care centre. Democracy implies the right of people to govern themselves. It does not mean the right of everybody to interfere in everyone else's business. </PARA>
<PARA> It was Robert Menzies who said that in his view liberty had to be the fundamental organising principle of a civilised society. The new age of democracy that is coming will, I believe, prove him to be correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I apologise to the honourable member for Kennedy for not being in the House when he asked his question yesterday. I did not get into the House because I was too busy talking to the Chairman of the Wool Council of Australia. The honourable member is very interested in this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is that in recent years individual growers and Australia's wool exports overall have been doing well. But I regret to inform the House that, irrespective of the decisions that will be made over the next few weeks, the prospects for some growers in the short term will be bleak. In particular, the future circumstances of the small specialist grower may be specially difficult. Of course, the larger growers, as ever, will survive. That has always been the case.</PARA>
<PARA> What is facing wool growers who collectively make up one of our premier export industries-certainly, wool is always our first or second biggest export-is the real possibility of only a slow reduction in the total volume of wool produced, a large increase in stocks held in warehouses around the country, a massive increase in the wool tax, increases in the borrowing requirement of the Australian Wool Corporation and the risk that the international demand for our wool will deteriorate in the short to medium term. These are not cheering prospects-they are not cheering prospects for the small growers who will be most affected and they are not cheering prospects for members of this House. So it is therefore essential that the industry, in making decisions in the next few weeks, look at all the facts, all the options and all the risks. It is important that it makes the decision that will best advantage growers, not just for the coming year but also for the years after 1990-91. That is the course of action endorsed by this Government and I am sure it is the course of action endorsed by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been reticent up to this stage to put forward to the industry the need for full cataloguing of the facts for it to make that analysis due to commercial reasons. In fact, it has been harder to drag out information on this industry than to drag Senator Bishop out of a Commonwealth car.</PARA>
<PARA> Last Monday it became very important that facts be put out. The Wool Council and the Wool Corporation have done that with some combinations of figures. The Council and the Corporation will be taking decisions over the next few weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reject absolutely the whole premise and notion of the question. The Government has been the only government in the last quarter of a century to make fundamental changes in Australia. I have seen sitting in the Prime Minister's chair beside me and standing in this place a succession of Prime Ministers and Treasurers who were not prepared to make fundamental changes to the fabric of the economy. Of course, this is particularly true-naturally, more true-of the coalition than it is of the former Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now in a position where we are facing a set of indices. Let me record some of them. We have the first surplus on the public sector's accounts ever, that is, the Commonwealth recurrent budget and the Commonwealth authorities' borrowing program, with the same revenue to gross domestic produce (GDP) share as in the Opposition's last year: not through taxes but through cuts in government spending.</PARA>

<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not sensitive. I just like a little bit of order. We have the first public sector surplus, the Commonwealth recurrent budget and its authorities and the States' recurrent budget and their authorities-the lot-summing to a net saver for the first time in our history. We have a huge Commonwealth fiscal surplus delivered through cuts in government spending. We have a shift in outlays from 30.5 to 23.7 per cent of GDP-7 per cent of gross domestic product or, in today's terms, about $25 billion a year in reductions to Commonwealth government spending. Transposed into the public sector, that is a change in the public sector borrowing requirement of the order of nearly 8 per cent of GDP or approaching $30 billion a year. Honourable members should remember that the fundamental problem of the current account is a call on overseas savings of 3 3/4 per cent of GDP beyond where we can afford the level of investment in Australia. For a 3 3/4 percentage point savings problem, the Government has put into place an 8 percentage point change. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is that we now have unit labour costs and the wage share in GDP at below 1960-61 levels, and the profit share is the highest in the nation's history. We are just slowing an investment phase of such proportions that the current account could not even tolerate it. We have broadened the tax base by putting new bases in the system which make the tax system not only more efficient but more fair-capital gains tax, substantiation, the fringe benefits tax and dividend imputation, cutting the tax on distribution income from 78c in the dollar to 47c or, if it is retained in a company, to 39c.</PARA>

<PARA> This Government is making changes in the micro-economy by doing something about tariffs, for instance. Yesterday we were talking about motor cars. When we came into office the tariff on motor cars-the effective rate of protection under those opposite-was 250 per cent. By 1992, under us, it will be 86 per cent-and no quotas. In fact, the average level of manufacturing protection rose under the coalition Government between 1977 and 1982, despite the fact that a former Labor government actually cut the tariff by 25 per cent. Other changes include the total revamp of retirement incomes and superannuation, providing a savings nest egg for the nation of between $600 billion and $800 billion by the year 2000, with 4 per cent of GDP a year going into savings. Opposition members talk about remedial policy. The hide of them, to get up and juxtapose their puny, pathetic efforts against a change like that.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, there are two former advisers to the previous Government sitting opposite. One is the Leader of the Opposition, who sat there watching protection levels rise, watching the Budget imbalance run into a deficit of nearly 5 per cent of GDP, watching the punitive tax on dividend income at 78c in the dollar--</PARA>

All governments generate their own process of change-certainly this Government has-and the various impetuses to those processes of change. This naturally comes from the leadership of the Party and the Government. In this case it is the Prime Minister; and, in my case, as the senior economic Minister, as the Treasurer; and in the case of the various substantial portfolio interests in the Expenditure Review Committee of the Government including, I might say, my colleague Senator Button. I believe he has been the only Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in my memory who has actually presided over falling levels of industrial protection in this country-the only one. He did it on his own initiative and did not need to be pushed, prodded and dragged along as Opposition members were, and where they still fail. The fact is that we generate our enthusiasm, but at least we focus on real issues. What Opposition members have to do is focus on why they have been beaten four times. The Opposition has made a fraudulent appeal for tax cuts-as I said yesterday, the return to Box Hill, this great thing for change, `Hewson promises the visionary rule. Under his leadership he will tackle the tough decisions'. The front page of a newspaper indicates that those tough decisions involved giving tax cuts to those on middle incomes. Handing out tax cuts is a real tough policy, so why do Opposition members not get away from the sorts of questions that would not even pass muster at a Young Liberals meeting and get down to a bit of policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members will not ask a question on wool. In the first six months of the 1989-90 season wool exports to China were 60 per cent lower than the level for the corresponding period a year earlier. Similarly, purchases from Japan have declined by about 20 per cent and, because of the relatively high level of stocks held by Japanese processors plus a range of other factors, including the Japanese exchange rate, purchases are likely to be subdued during the 1990-91 season. Honourable members are aware of the recent request by the Soviet Union for credit terms on recent sales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are simply part of the circumstances which have given us a different form of a stock build-up in the wool industry. I could also nominate reaction to the higher prices two or three years ago. What has to be analysed by the industry in the decisions that have to be taken is price and thereby the spread of prices under the minimum reserve price scheme, the levy or taxation level on the industry, the borrowing requirement, and also marketing and promotion strategies, particularly centring on the middle level of micron in the wool sales. That is why I say that the industry and the corporation should be focusing on a package rather than just one or two parameters. They should also not be focusing just on supply and on just one year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the labour force figures for one are a reasonable indication that the economy is not in a severe downturn. I should have thought that the import numbers from last month's balance of payments give some indication that there is still a substantial level of demand in the economy. This is obviously not true of all sectors. Some sectors are languishing somewhat in relation to others but the judgment has to be what is the general state of activity overall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important point, I think, to understand is, unlike the episodes in the last 15 years, that is, 1982-83 and 1974-75, what has not happened has been the destruction of the profit share. What we have not seen, therefore, is massive lay-offs in industry, high unemployment and companies collapsing by virtue of the fact that their profits have dried up. This is not the case now. Senator Button is making a judgment about where he sees the current state of the economy, and this is all a matter of emphasis rather than a qualitative judgment.

Those opposite should hang their heads in shame when they know that after 30 years of office there can be only 4 per cent of incremental production whereas economies to our near north can do sixes and eights and, in some cases, tens and not see their demand spill into imports. That is because they were around in the 1970s and were not asleep at the wheel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of Senator Button's remarks in the Senate. I will certainly check them. But the point remains that the supply response of the Australian motor vehicle industry has been lamentable in this recent period. The fact that we have been producing fewer cars today than we were in 1985 when we have had a car plan in place and enhanced competitiveness, I should imagine, speaks volumes for the supply response which we have had from the Australian motor vehicle industry. That is not to say that there has not been substantial investment and that there has not been modernisation of plants and equipment and improvement in quality and design. There has. I for one am quite happy to go on the record praising the industry in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the industry had the capacity from 1985 to 1986 onwards to actually capture most of the market share which was going to imports. But those investments were not undertaken because there has always been a focus upon the domestic industry and upon the capacity of manufacturers to go to their boards and get new capital for investments which basically have been tailored to the domestic side of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> It is only more recently that we are seeing Ford produce a vehicle for export, but again any exports that are coming would not be economic, would be sub-economic, at the moment were it not for the complementary arrangements such as under the export facilitation programs, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA> But that said, we have seen a substantial reduction in protection. In 1985 the effective rate was 250 per cent. This year it will be 104 per cent. As I said, it will be 86 per cent by 1992. Senator Button is quite sensibly looking at the prospects for the industry post-1992, bearing in mind that he removed quota protection-which was established by the party of honourable members opposite-in 1988. So we are now starting to see, if you like, some of the more potent end of the car plan start to have its effect upon motor vehicle production and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA> But were we in the position that the motor vehicle industry could have supplied the cars which have been required by Australians over the recent period we would find that the current account would improve. Of course, there are vehicles which we do not make here, many of which are imported, such as four-wheel drive vehicles, higher priced vehicles, et cetera.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important, when we are talking about the PBRT, to think that we have in Australia a situation where the leaders of pharmacy,in different guises, carried out a campaign against the Government and are able, after an election in which the Government was returned, to put out information in their Guild bulletin which says, `Congratulations. We won'. That is a strange definition of winning. The point of the matter is that the Government is not interested in dealing with that issue in such a trivial way. We are consistently, as we have been over the years, going back to the PBRT and putting to the Tribunal that pharmacy remuneration should be based on objective data on the cost of dispensing pharmaceutical benefits scheme medications; it should not be based on the cost of providing other services that are supplied by pharmacists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think one important thing that needs to be noted in terms of this Tribunal's inquiry is that it was a condition of the PBRT that all parties should agree to cooperate. The reality is that the Government has always cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the PBRT. Let us hope that on this occasion, as the leaders of pharmacy in various organisations have failed their members by not providing a cohesive proposition and submissions in front of the PBRT and have also failed in their relationship with government, that responsible people in pharmacy, the more moderate people in pharmacy, will rise up and seek to work more cooperatively not only with government but also with the community and the PBRT. The grassroots pharmacists are sick and tired of having their money taken away from them and used for purely political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> In that regard, I think we have to look at the words of Mr Mathews, the national president of the Guild, quoted in the April issue of Pharmacy Review, the official journal of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, as saying, in relation to the Guild's own elections, `Vote for the person who will tell you the fight will never finish, because that person is both realistic and honest'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to his comment that Government Ministers should be `lifting their ambitions for a change, not just talking about it-actually getting it done'. As the Treasurer took responsibility for the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) away from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce and now has responsibility for the Industry Commission, can he please tell the House, firstly, what outstanding recommendations from the former IAC are yet to be acted upon and, secondly, when he will announce the necessary terms of reference for the remaining Industry Commission reviews announced in the forward work program back on 15 August 1989?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="494" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of those terms of reference have been decided upon. Let me just recap, for the benefit of the House, the very ambitious program which we have now given the Industry Commission and the various inquiries. They are: energy generation and distribution; railways; passenger motor vehicles; construction costs for major plants; export franchising and distribution arrangements; raw material pricing for domestic use; product liability; availability of capital; mining and minerals processing; commercial tariff concession system; statutory marketing arrangements; dairying; sugar; health services; education services; recycling; imported aids and appliances for disabled people; and implications for Australia of firms locating offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Beyond that, the Prime Minister, in the course of the election campaign, outlined a program of micro-economic reform which, of course, comprehends some of the products of those reviews. Let me again run through those by headings: general tariff reform; motor vehicles tariff reform; textiles, clothing and footwear protection reform; May 1988, agricultural reforms; foreign exchange market; the banking sector; non-bank sector; deregulation of foreign investment; termination of the two-airline agreement; international passenger charter policy; international air freight; grain handling reform; telecommunication reform package of May 1988; the company tax reform; reform of government business enterprises; the Industrial Relations Act; award restructuring; and the list goes on.</PARA>
<PARA> We are using the Industry Commission for economy-wide references of the kind indicated by terms such as `railways' and `energy generation and distribution in Australia'. These are all issues which were draining State Budgets back in the 1970s. State rail deficits have been an issue in State fiscal policy for years, but none of the honourable members opposite has the wit or the interest to do anything about them. All the Opposition ever did with the Industries Assistance Commission was give it tariff references, like the old Tariff Board, because it still had these high points of industrial protection, and it had the IAC focusing on those instead of on the broader industry issues.</PARA>
<PARA> Again, it just underlines the point that the only party in this Parliament looking to the broad issues for Australia-even beyond the macro-economy to these important areas in the micro-economy-is the Government, and the Industry Commission will play a vital, important role in shedding light upon those issues and disseminating information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his recent speech concerning a consumption tax. I ask the Treasurer: Is it correct that during the period in office of this Government the tax system has been made more progressive? Can the Treasurer detail the Government's intention to ensure that the progressive tax system it has in place will be maintained?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="494" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax system has become more progressive. We have broadened the tax base and cut rates. So, instead of having a narrow base of taxation with high marginal rates, we now have a broad base with lower marginal rates. We have broadened the base through things such as capital gains, substantiation, the fringe benefits tax, the prescribed payments system, audits and the rest, all of which were opposed by the current Opposition during the last half a dozen years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition is now complaining that the progressivity of the tax system has been greatly increased. This must be a first, in terms of a major party in the Western world. It is a complaint that the tax system is actually more progressive. In an article in the Australian Financial Review last week headed, `Hewson priority: cut tax rates on middle incomes' there is this very telltale line:</PARA>
<PARA> This is his priority-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Leader of the Opposition-</PARA>
<PARA>in taxation. Consumption tax is incidental to this objective.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we are starting to see the wimp-out already dropped into stories given to journalists-in this case, the senior political journalist of the Financial Review-by the Leader of the Opposition. Here we are, only a couple of weeks into the brave new world where big decisions are being taken and large initiatives grasped and we find that the consumption tax is only incidental to this objective. In other words, it was not really about a consumption tax or a change in savings; it was really about giving tax cuts to middle income earners. This was just a device.</PARA>
<PARA> Then there was former Senator Stone in this most revealing piece where, instead of relying on humbug as was his wont, he has come exactly dead clean to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is precisely because the consumption tax-cum-income tax cutting proposals are recognised as inegalitarian that all of them include various associated measures for ``compensating'' those adversely affected . . . . The problem then is that the more perfectly you ``compensate'' those . . . affected . . . the more egalitarian you render the overall . . . outcome-and, hence, the less you succeed in enhancing national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say, `Why muck around with a consumption tax? Bump up the tax-free threshold and use the money to cut the top rate'. In other words, tax low income earners more heavily and use the income to cut the top rate.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the consumption tax proposal was urged on the Leader of the Opposition by the honourable member for Bennelong at the first shadow Executive meeting.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not wrong. The Leader of the Opposition was arraigned against the consumption tax. I will not bother quoting at length his views about it. However, in a display of non-leadership he then picked up the option which was suggested to him by his new dry right-wing front bench. We have the former Leader of the Opposition outdoing the crusader number: the consumption tax, he says, is bigger than the rest of us, an issue that will not go away.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is from the sort of reformer in the wings. This is the fellow who had the tax base so narrow that we needed a 60 per cent marginal rate. This is the person who, as Treasurer, let capital gains escape through the system for seven years and who let the lack of fringe benefits taxation become a joke, a haemorrhage of the tax system, beyond the criminal evasion schemes, which he finally had to deal with when he was exposed by the McCabe-Lafranchi report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we are supposed to forget all that and say, `Oh, yes, John, we know that you are a great closet tax reformer and now you will unveil the issue which is bigger than all of us, the consumption tax'. He even suggested it to the Leader of the Opposition, to saddle him up with some lead weight in the saddlebags on day one of week one-when the Leader of the Opposition himself actually has the guile to understand that the Opposition cannot cut tax rates; unless one does what former Senator Stone said, penalise the poor at the expense of the rich. That is what it is down to.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Wrong', says the Leader of the Opposition-another anti-intellectual comment. The mathematics do not matter. He just throws a political word at you, `wrong', when in fact the truth of the matter is that, as I have shown, it is not possible to produce new proceeds from the consumption tax, for the various reasons that I gave, namely, that the wholesale sales tax has been expanded and the tax base is now bigger and requires more compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that, if the Liberal Party wants to proceed down the tax consumption route, it can do so only on the basis that it will disadvantage low income earners to the advantage of high income earners. We have seen from the Leader of the Opposition that the consumption tax is now incidental to his broader objectives. It is the first trickle, the first evidence of a wimp-out which will only rival the occasion when honourable members opposite had to escape their commitments to inflation adjustments to the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said last week, the former Leader was left off by the media and the public generally, because he was regarded as economically illiterate, that he would not know anyway. But that is not the claim the Leader of the Opposition has about himself or how he likes to see himself. So, if he wants to wimp-out he will do so in the full gaze of public scrutiny and, of course, the full vehemence of the Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Employment, Education and Training aware of the recently reported criticism of the Government's higher education policies by the former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Professor David Caro? Can the Minister advise the House whether these criticisms have any substance?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="496" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. At the risk of seeming a little sensitive to criticism, I indicate that I have noticed the remarks of Professor Caro. Frankly, I find them astonishing and unbelievable. The point is that Professor Caro has now been out of the business of running universities for several years, except, of course, he has recently been involved in the planning for the new university in the Northern Territory, a university only possible because of the policies that this Government has pursued over the last few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was interested to go back to a time when Professor Caro was a bit more involved in the business of universities as Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University. In 1982 he made some very trenchant criticisms of the then Government-of course, the then coalition Government-about the lack of any national policy for universities that could provide a basis on which the universities could plan with confidence for their future for the next three years or, as he said, the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA> He went on to make a particular criticism about the way in which research was funded, saying that there needed to be more targeting of research funding, that there needed to be a greater concentration of effort on our best researchers, rather than doing what was done at that time-spreading the research dollars very thinly. Yet now, of course, he says that these are just the things that the Government has got wrong; that we should not be proceeding with a policy that corrects distortions of the old binary system; and that we should not be targeting research. There is a question of consistency and I would have hoped that someone of Professor Caro's standing would have at least had the decency to recognise that the Government had in fact done many of the things that he urged earlier governments to do way back in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point about all this is that Professor Caro seems to be wildly out of touch with contemporary sentiment within universities at the moment. Indeed, a recent survey conducted by the University of New England finds that two-thirds of those who were questioned strongly agreed that larger organisations result in greater opportunity for student access to a broader range of courses. Moreover, 76 per cent agreed with the proposition that larger organisations provide more opportunity to shift resources between schools and faculties with shifts in student and community demands.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, academics now are saying that the results of our reforms are exactly those which we held out for them at the time we proposed them. They also say that the concentration of research, the competitive allocation of research funds, will in fact improve the quality of research being undertaken in Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only is Professor Caro out of touch with current sentiment within the universities, he is also wildly out of touch with what international observers are saying about what they are pleased to call the Dawkins revolution in higher education in Australia. I refer to the Times higher education supplement. In an editorial to that supplement what we have been doing is compared with the fumbled attempts of those in Britain who are tackling some of the same kinds of issues. The editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA> The obsolescence of the binary policy has been tackled-</PARA>
<PARA>in Australia-</PARA>
<PARA>and a new National Unified System created; in Britain binaryism has been left to fester to death.</PARA>
<PARA> The editor of this journal also points out that in Australia we have tackled the question of the viability of institutions based on their size whereas in Britain that issue has been comprehensively ducked. The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The building of a post-binary system is bound to be a delicate business, not only for universities jealous of their research reputations but for colleges which fear that their particular values may be overwhelmed by a donnish tradition. At least in Australia the issues are out in the open; there is no choice but to address the key questions; there is a robustness and an honesty about the futures debate that is still sadly lacking in Britain. The Dawkins revolution is a real revolution; the Baker revolution still seems half-bogus.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is quite obvious that international commentators, fair-minded as they are, recognise the important changes that we have been making. They recognise that, as a result of these changes, we have been able to massively expand access, equity and opportunity for Australian students and potential students and also ensure that we can respond to the contemporary demands of the Australian economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Flinders)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.19)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question that there is an absolutely urgent need for a fundamental change of Government policy to reverse Australia's dire economic circumstances. Distasteful as it might be for those on this side of the House, the fact is that Labor was returned at the recent Federal election; and I say to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the people of Australia are looking to him and his Government for the sort of economic management that will produce the results which will satisfy the many promises that they made about this country being better off under a Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of those expectations from the new Government was to see a sustained reduction in interest rates and a reduction in this country's debt. The people want to see policies that in due course will see higher living standards, not lower living standards, as a result of economic policy. I think anybody listening to Question Time today could only be disappointed with the pathetic responses that we had from the Treasurer on a number of occasions. On three separate occasions he failed to get up to the mark on questions that we very properly put to him. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Treasurer, it is just not good enough for him, as he did yesterday, to mount a premeditated attack on the third most senior member of the Government; to breach Cabinet solidarity; to go around referring to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as Old Jellyback as he has in the past, and as Senator Walsh has more recently; to take a swipe at the Prime Minister as he goes past; and then stand up in Question Time as he did today and effectively say, `Well, it is business as usual'. I have got news for the Treasurer. It is not business as usual. He cannot launch a frontal attack on the Government of the day and then sit back and say, `That was only yesterday, it is a matter of no consequence for the future'. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that there are two factors driving the in-fighting that we see from day to day coming from this Government. The first factor is, of course, the Treasurer's ego and his prime ministerial ambitions. I see somebody nodding in the gallery. If I were asked what is the most significant factor, I would say one can never go past the Treasurer's ego as being the biggest factor in any such equation. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the Treasurer took his baton out of his backpack. Honourable members have heard him talk about how everybody carries a baton. Yesterday he took his baton out and put it on the table for all to see. I say to the Prime Minister that he is kidding himself if he thinks that the Treasurer has retracted his 1980 statement, `The first leader I tear down is the one I replace.' Those were not mocking words. That was a statement of the Treasurer's philosophy, backed up by this classic Keating statement in Australian Business in January 1982. When he was asked about the leadership he said, `That is for my colleagues to determine. You have to keep moving up in politics and I will try to keep moving. It is a matter of whether my colleagues let me.' That is the Treasurer's philosophy. I say to the Prime Minister, `Watch out at your peril.'. </PARA>
<PARA> The second factor, inextricably woven with the first is, of course, the growing realisation that the Treasurer's economic policies are just doomed to failure. This Treasurer, for all his hard appearances, is very sensitive when it comes to criticism of his economic management. Why is he sensitive about his credibility as a Treasurer? It is because he knows every such criticism undermines his run for the top job. </PARA>
<PARA> What Senator Button said yesterday was just unexceptional. There was no news in what Senator Button said. Everybody has been saying it. I call them `Walshisms'. This is a post-election frankness-a post-election real assessment of Labor's economic and other policies. What Senator Walsh has said is what other Ministers have been saying. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give the House an example. Senator Walsh said that there is a severe downturn. The Treasurer knocked that one back today. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said that we are in a technical recession. The former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, said that the Treasurer had engineered a recession. That one hurt. Then there was the former Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), who said that we are sliding into a recession. Then there was the statement by the campaign manager-and this one must have hurt too-the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), that tough economic decisions need to be taken, and that not enough were taken last time. </PARA>
<PARA> I rather like this one from the new boy, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who said that he would resign if waterfront reform did not occur within 12 months. I say to the Minister that we have taken his resignation, put it in a brown envelope, it is sitting in the safe of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and we will open it in 12 months time. It is a very interesting statement. It really acknowledges the complete failure of this Government in the seven years to date. He is saying that if, after 12 months, we do not finally make some progress the game ought to be given away. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, many of these statements-these assessments-are made by people in the Government, former senior ministers, who are actually part of the decision-making process. They are not outsiders; these are the insiders giving us inside information as to decision making within Labor. Of course, for the Opposition's part, we have been saying many of these things for 18 months and more. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to put themselves in the position of the Treasurer-a person with unbounded prime ministerial ambition, who finds a lost of pressure mounting on him with these criticisms about his economic policies and economic mismanagement. I ask honourable members to put themselves in his position: alone and ambitious, prime ministerial ambition still to be satisfied and a prime ministerial ambition not to be treated lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy used by the Treasurer yesterday was a very simple one, an old strategy and in the past an effective one-and that is that offence is often the best form of defence. Why not attack as high as possible? Who did he pick as his target? He did not pick No. 1, as that is for later, and he is No. 2, so he went for No. 3. Who better than No. 3?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer made two announcements at the doorstop conference yesterday at half past 10. The first one was that he announced the problem. There is a superb irony in this. His thesis yesterday was that all our problems have been micro-economic problems. He has maintained, of course, that they were not his responsibility but the responsibility of someone else and that it was an absolute disgrace that he should have to get up month after month and explain why it was that the current account was such a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage honourable members to refer back to last year, because on micro-economic reform and its importance it was the same bloke who said that micro-economic reform was all a matter for the petshop galahs, that he was in charge of macro-reforms. He said he was working on the big picture, that he was the big puller of levers. Yet, this year he says that it is in fact micro-economic reform. I simply ask the Treasurer, `Who is the galah, now, mate?'</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's announcement yesterday was, first, an announcement of the problem and, secondly, an announcement of the solution. What is the solution? It is none other than the Treasurer himself. He really said yesterday that he has had enough, that bringing some of these Ministers into line is long overdue. That was the swipe at the Prime Minister. What he said was that he would show the way, that he was the big agent for change for this Government for now and into the future. He said that he would fix the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> What a most extraordinary statement. What a gall for the Treasurer to say yesterday publicly that he will fix the problems. He is the problem! He is the architect of the economic mismanagement which is about to see rising unemployment and continuing high interest rates. He is the Mr Recession of Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures about the national accounts that came out a month or so ago were very revealing. They showed the recession on its way. What did the Treasurer say? He said, `Beautiful numbers'. He welcomed them with open arms. He thought that this was great news. The climbing queues of unemployment was music to the ears of the Treasurer. Honourable members do not have to believe me: his former mate the ex-Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, let the cat out of the bag when he said that the Government's clear and deliberate policy was to engineer a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, of course, is well known for his turn of phrase, and when it comes to taking credit no man stands more at the top of the queue than our Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to some of his previous remarks about who runs economic policy in this country and who has responsibility for it. One could go back through every year, starting back in 1983. I have just gone back to 1987 and run through to 1989. A classic statement he made in September 1987 was:</PARA>
<PARA> This is the great coming of age of Australia. This is the golden age of economic change. </PARA>
<PARA>The questioner asked: `How much credit do you take?' and the Treasurer replied, `Oh, a very large part'. In his Economic Statement of May 1988 the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the measures I have just outlined represent another milestone in the transformation of the Australian economy and another chapter in the proud economic history of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>It is just amazing. In 1989, not being one to stand back when it comes to claiming success, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in presenting last year's Budget I said that Australia was on the way to a systematic restructuring of its economy, making it more dynamic and more able to compete in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer has to be joking. The economy is not more dynamic. We are going into a recession. It is time he woke up to that and realised the consequences of his economic policies. In the 1989-90 Budget Speech the Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, I can report that we are much further down the road of that fundamental restructuring than we were a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA>We are on the Argentinean road, and that is it. It is time that the Treasurer understood that. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the one which brings home the bacon. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the great economic and political failures of modern Australian politics was his one admission that he had to do something about inflation-to get it to 3 or 4 per cent. Inflation is now one of the greatest evils afflicting the Australian economy. This Treasurer said that inflation would be 3 or 4 per cent. Of course, we all know that it is at 8.6 per cent and rising. That tells much about his economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that yesterday we saw the Treasurer introduce a new element to economic policy and that was, of course, his prime ministerial ambition. He moved his own prime ministerial ambitions into a new gear. And what a good day he picked to announce his prime ministerial ambitions in the way that he did. Yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the Treasurer's comments that this country could end up as a banana republic. What interesting reading it makes to go back to the Treasurer's pronouncements of four years ago. Let me remind him of what he said then. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If in the final analysis Australia is so undisciplined, so disinterested in its salvation and its economic well-being, fall back solution is inevitable because you can't fund $12 billion a year in perpetuity every year and then the interest on the year before that, and the interest on the year before that . . . </PARA>

This Government wins the election and then thinks it is time for an economic holiday. It thinks it is time for a holiday when in fact what it is time for is some fundamental change to economic policy. The Treasurer went straight on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the only thing to do is to slow the growth down to a canter. Once you slow down the growth under 3 per cent, unemployment starts again . . . Then, you have gone. You are a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>Do not those words come back to haunt the Treasurer? The reality is, as Senator Walsh himself said, that this Government, facing a problem of excess demand, went for the traditional Aussie remedy for the Australian economy-put it into a coma; bring on a recession; increase the unemployment queues. It makes one sick to hear these people talk about compassion and the needs of the disadvantaged when they mount a deliberate policy to bring this economy into recession. They do so at a time when there is a long list of things that need to be done, as the Treasurer partly recognised in Question Time today, on the supply side. The fact is that it is the Government's deal with its trade union mates that stops it and prevents it from getting on and doing the things that need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I say, in conclusion, that this Government has got real economic problems. Those problems are a result of the Treasurer's economic mismanagement. It is time that he faced up to it and it is time that he delivered a statement to this House as to the fundamental changes required to address those problems. </PARA>

I know that a lot of people in public life write off the people around them, often on their own side, and certainly opposite. I do not. I never underestimate any of them and I invariably wait and see what they have to offer. This was the first foray of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in terms of a public statement either by way of a matter of public importance, a motion of the sort that he sought to move earlier to give me leave to make a statement, or the option, if he wanted to pursue it, of moving a censure motion. This matter of public importance was his chosen vehicle. The terms of that matter of public importance are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The urgent need for a fundamental change of Government policy to reverse Australia's dire economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>One should have thought that in what in effect is a maiden speech on economic policy we would have heard some recital of the fundamental changes that he in particular, as shadow Treasurer, and the Opposition in general, believe the Government should invoke in satisfaction of our economic problems. But we heard not one proposition; not even half of one proposition. What we heard was a speech one would expect from a member doing the rounds of the Liberal Party branches in his electorate-a sort of Monday night speech to a branch meeting about the Government. That was the quality and level of it; it had not intellectual force whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> As I listened to the speech I made the following notes: pathetic response at Question Time; derogatory references to the Prime Minister; the Treasurer's ego; my run for the so-called top job; Senator Walsh and Mr Dawkins' comments; my prime ministerial ambitions; quotes that he thinks are revealing and which were not; and, at the end, a half a minute in closing. That was the sum total of what he had to offer. It had nothing to do with the sort of change that he believes ought to be made. There was nothing to sustain his proposition. There was no substance whatsoever in his maiden outing in respect of economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all people in this House, I have waited to see just what the shadow Treasurer would have to say-what his proposition would be; what his gambit would be. It is what I thought it would be-nothing; an empty vessel in a navy blue suit. I can tell those honourable members behind him that he sold them all a pup when he said, `I was instrumental in defeating the referendums'. He claims credit-it is very dubious credit-for being involved in the defeat of the referendum for a four-year parliament which would have advanced the country, the parties and the nation. But the fact of the matter was that it was general conservatism with referendums and the nature of the multiplicity of the referendums which defeated it, not his sterling advocacy. But he has traded on that from that day to this. He has now actually got a real job. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member had opportunities last week and yesterday to get into substantial issues. Instead of that, he came up with an ill-conceived attack upon the Government in a censure motion. Let me quote some of the headlines and the comment in respect of the drubbing that he received from the commentators this morning. The Daily Telegraph referred to `a limp parliamentary attack'. The Australian Financial Review stated:</PARA>
<PARA>`. . . a failure of preparation and flawed tactics blunted the impact of the Opposition's attack . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Melbourne Age stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Hewson inexperience is showing in a lack of sharp tactics. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Times stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not a strong performance by Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Oakes on the Today Show described the Opposition's handling of the debate as pathetic and said that there was no political nous in Hewson's office. Indeed, he could have also said, `Reith's office'. So yesterday we had nothing but bluster and not even bluster with a bit of style. Today there was no substance. There was not one thought about the fact that the Opposition has lost four elections. Members of the Opposition must think to themselves, `Well, where have we gone wrong? Why have the Australian people not accepted us and rejected us on four occasions?' Why do not members of the Opposition start to analyse their policy positions and think about the structure of the economy?</PARA>

Maybe in their thirteenth or sixteenth year they might be successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition is not saying anything about its wages policy, its health policy, its attitude to monetary policy-which was to induce a very deep recession-et cetera. It does not understand the linkages which the Government has in place. The honourable member for Flinders now has the indecency to talk about a slowdown in the economy as though it were a deep recession when all along that was the Opposition's very policy. Had it won the election, on the day following the election the Opposition would have told the central bank to hold interest rates at the current levels and not reduce them. The fact is that that would have reduced the economy by way of a massive recession. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, the Government has succeeded in the transition to lower demand and to lower inflation. The national accounts, which the honourable member scorned in his address a few minutes ago, reveal that very clearly: we had a state of almost precise balance between demand and gross domestic product (GDP) in the December quarter national accounts, a far cry from the 9 per cent growth in gross national expenditure and the 4 per cent in product in the year to September. In other words, our policy is working. Demand is in a state of transition and so, too, is inflation. We saw inflation decelerate on a quarter by quarter basis, coming down in each quarter to the last quarter, and it will be descending further. We have seen the current account trending down. We have seen inflation peaking and declining, as I have said. That was also borne out by the broader deflators that came out in the national accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Employment growth has slowed, but we have seen no marked shake-out in the labour market and we are still dealing with a very high participation rate-naturally high because people have been buoyed by the Government's capacity to create jobs. We have seen exceptional profitability in Australian business, that being broadly maintained by the wage accord and the wage arrangements of this year which are in place. Growth in wages remains moderate in that 6 to 7 per cent area, which the Opposition would have been incapable of delivering. Investment remains high, with investment expectations for the year coming of 30 per cent in nominal terms. We will be putting a fairly heavy discount into those investment forecasts but, even with a discount, they will still be strong. </PARA>
<PARA> How could the Opposition have imagined that it would have strong investment in an economy which was recessed as badly as that of 1982-83? The task for 1983-84 and 1984-85 was to get the whole economy moving. I notice that today some commentators are focusing on outlays growth in 1983-84 and 1984-85, saying that this was not helpful for the current account. The point of the plot then was to breathe life back into the body and to get it going. We got it going. Now we have the big change in outlays that has come since and we are now contemplating, after a year of extraordinarily high demand and the application of a tough monetary policy, strong levels of investment. Could anyone have imagined that there would ever be strong levels of investment? There was nothing on the horizon in 1983-84, 1984-85 or 1985-86 after the Opposition had done its handiwork on the economy. Yet it is saying that it wants a fundamental change. It does not say what the change should be or from where. Does it mean a change from 1983-84 or a change from 1989-90?</PARA>
<PARA> As I said today, we have already seen a 7 percentage point shift of GDP in public outlays on the Commonwealth account. We have a Budget in surplus, with the revenue to GDP share the same as it was in the last year that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Treasurer of this country. We have seen a wage share lower than at any time since 1960-61 and a profit share at an all-time high. We are seeing investments at levels and of such strength that even the current account cannot stand. We have seen a total change in the tax system whereby we are taxing debt once and equity once, instead of debt once and equity twice, with a capital gains tax and with dividend imputation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing a dramatic change in industrial protection, freeing up these import competing and exporting sectors, so that by the end of 1992 we will see the average level of protection for Australian manufacturing at 12 per cent, down from the highs we had during the Opposition period in government-in such things as motor cars from 250 per cent down to 86 per cent. These are the changes made since 1983-84. They include deregulation of the financial markets, floating exchange rate, and $50 billion of offshore assets, there by virtue of the abolition of exchange controls which the Opposition rigorously kept and adhered to in the most regulated system one could have imagined. Yet the Opposition is talking about fundamental change. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition want? Does it want a higher profit share than there is now and a lower wage share? Is that what the Opposition would like? Would it like an even bigger cut in government spending to start ripping away at all of the States? What would it prefer on the tax side? Does it think that the corporate rate of 39c is too high with dividend imputation? It does not know what it would do with the place. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech of the honourable member for Flinders, his coming out speech, was pathetic. It was the sort of thing one does around the branches on a Monday night-if one is a Liberal Party MP. We do not treat our branches to that kind of nonsense and twaddle, as those opposite obviously have been doing in the mushroom clubs, which pass for branches for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have got up to respond to the matter of public importance. I did so with the misgiving that I was responding to a proposition that was not referred to in the address given by the shadow Treasurer. He talked about no fundamental change of policy in his address. He ragged over references to me, the Prime Minister, Senator Walsh, my supposed ambitions, quotes et cetera, and produced the sort of empty, vacuous performance that so typified the Opposition in the last Parliament. It gives us on this side hope that late at night in the next Parliament there will still be cups of tea at 10 o'clock in the Opposition corridors of the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA> What occurred yesterday, which is the immediate trigger for this matter of public importance, represented by any dispassionate measure that most serious division in the ranks of the Hawke Government since it was elected in March 1983. All the bravado and all the walking out and all the false optimism and bonhomie does not alter the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) presides over a deeply riven and deeply divided Government. Nothing can be done by the Government, and nothing was done by the Treasurer during Question Time or during this matter of public importance, to alter that unassailable fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Button was told off by the Treasurer because he had the temerity to tell the truth about the state of the Australian economy. That is the plain and simple fact. Let us put all the other obfuscations by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to one side. What did Senator Button say on the Walsh Report on Sunday? I saw that program myself, as I am sure many other members did. On that program he said that there was a very simple proposition, that is, that the Australian economy is in a very serious plight and that it is an absolute nonsense for anybody to be talking about lifting living standards at a time when our economy is in such deep difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> He also had the honesty to acknowledge what everybody on both sides of the House knows, that is, that by and large the third Hawke Government was a micro-economic disaster. It said when it was elected in 1987 that this was going to be the term of micro-economic reform. It did nothing about privatisation, nothing about coastal shipping reform, nothing about waterfront reform, and precious little about labour market reform. The Government presided over a further disintegration of our by then already parlous current account deficit situation. That is the measure of the failure of the third Hawke Government and Senator Button had the honesty to acknowledge it. </PARA>
<PARA> He said it was stupid of anybody to talk about rising living standards in the immediate future, and so it is. The honest people on the other side of the House know that and we on this side of the House know it. Any Australian politician who goes around at the present time talking up living standards is being utterly dishonest and dishonourable to the Australian people. That is what Senator Button said on the Sunday program. He also said that he thought that if the Government did not deliver during its fourth term it would lose at the next election. I would have thought that he was speaking the views of most of the Australian public. Everybody knows we have difficulties: the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of Australian Industry. Every major economic commentator in Australia has for weeks, if not months, been writing that there needs to be a change of economic policy and that current policies simply are not working. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind Government members again, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reminded them, that yesterday was the fourth anniversary of the Treasurer's banana republic declaration in which he said a very simple thing: `If we do not do something about our current account deficit, we are sunk'. Now four years later nothing has changed. Our current account deficit is still a disaster. The Treasurer still comes into the House and blames what happened seven, 10, 15, 20 years ago. It is a wonder he does not reach back to Jack Lang and Billy Hughes and the Founding Fathers and try to blame them. Time and time again this Treasurer insults the Opposition's intelligence and the intelligence of the Australian people by harking back to irrelevant ancient history. He also harks back in a most dishonest fashion. He would have us believe that for the first time ever we have a high level of business investment in Australia. I remind him that in current price terms the level of business investment in Australia was higher in 1981-82 than it has reached at any time under the stewardship of the honourable member for Blaxland as Treasurer. That is typical of his use of the glib misstatement, the looseness with the truth, the capacity for the one-liner, the capacity to intimidate many of his own members into silence on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be a very interesting test of good old John Button to see whether he can be intimidated into silence. If John Button has had a spine transplant-unlike some other people in the Government-if John Button has a bit of backbone, he will stand up to the Treasurer. He will tell the Treasurer that he, Senator Button, speaks for a wide cross-section of the Australian community and it is about time the Treasurer understood that changes in economic policy are necessary, that unless those changes are embarked upon soon the painful process of readjustment will take even longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody suggests on this side of the House that there is some magic wand. Nobody suggests that if we change the Government overnight we will bring about a great change. I certainly do not suggest that, but I do suggest that there are four or five areas where a change of direction is needed. I suggest, as I and my colleagues have been arguing for some years now, that we need a much faster pace of micro-economic reform. It is now five years since privatisation became a major political issue in Australia. What has the Government done? It has slammed the door shut on any prospect of privatisation in Australia. It is five or six years at least, at a party political level, since the cause of deregulating the labour market became a major issue. What has the Government done? It has closed the door shut on that, and it has done worse. It has got into bed with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and is in the process of facilitating the reduction in the number of unions to 20 mega-unions in this country, which will deliver more bureaucratic power into the hands of fewer and fewer trade union officials than we have ever had in our history. </PARA>

<PARA> On behalf of a long suffering public, I remind the Treasurer that all this ancient history point-scoring dishonours the seriousness of the debate. It demeans the intelligence of the Australian people, who demand more of their politicians on both sides at a time of significant economic crisis. Senator Button was truly expressing the views of the groaning Australian public when he said that perhaps we may have got a few things wrong and perhaps we need a change of policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Treasurer (Mr Keating), I find myself in a somewhat difficult position in that neither the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) nor the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) addressed the matter of public importance at all. The honourable member for Bennelong did have something nice to say about the Treasurer, so I suppose I should respond by saying that most of us on this side do regard the honourable member for Bennelong in a very warm and caring way because he is one of those people who, by and large, does not lay a glove on us. It is no surprise to us that in this debate today we had a couple of suburban lawyers trying to tell this Government what to do. When one looks at the records of the Government of which they were members and this Government, really, there is no comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose my fondest memory of the honourable member for Bennelong was in the 1987 election campaign, when he was up in a Brisbane shipyard and he launched what was called the rorts committee. This committee was supposed to be embarrassing to the Government in that there were a lot of work practices in the work force at that time that the Opposition was going to expose. It was going to bring them to the attention of the Australian people and sweep them out of the system altogether. All the rorts committee ever did was put out one press release and we never heard from it again. The reason we did not hear from it is that this Government's policies made sure that, to the extent that work practices were inhibiting growth in the Australian economy, it got rid of them. We did something about it; we did not just talk about it. That is a basic difference between this Government and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well suit the honourable member for Bennelong to say that we might go back seven years to when the Opposition was in government, but really that is all we have to judge it by. When those opposite were in government they were a miserable failure; it does not matter what area one looks at. We could look at something as recent as the last election campaign. They have been in opposition now for seven years and what have they come up with by way of a health policy? They do not have one. This is the eighth year of them being in opposition. There is no health policy; it is back to the drawing board. It is the sort of laziness that the Treasurer was talking about. There is no structure to the Liberal Party. All that Opposition members hope to do is to come up with a fistful of dollars at election time and say, `We will give you lower taxes'. What they will never say is how they are going to pay for that. The Treasurer put out a press release during the election campaign-and maybe these figures are open to question-in which he calculated that there were $7,000m in spending cuts that the Opposition failed to quantify. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to one of them and that is the tax policy where the Opposition said that it would have a two-tier tax rate with a top rate of 39 per cent. I will highlight the impact of that policy on the Australian population. Under the Liberal Party's tax policy, which would have cost nearly $3 billion-in actual fact $3.5 billion in a full year-a person earning $19,000 would have received the grand total of $2.27, which in actual fact, in percentage terms, is less than one per cent-0.7 per cent. That is what the Liberal Party would give someone earning $19,000 a year. What would it give to someone earning $100,000 a year? It would give that person $104.46, which is a real increase of 9 per cent. So that is fairness Liberal style-9 per cent for someone earning $100,000 per year, and less than one per cent for someone earning $19,000 per year, and $3.5 billion to pay for it. The people out there are not mugs; they rejected the Liberal Party for the fourth time. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse than that, the Opposition has opposed every measure that this Government has introduced to make the taxation system decent and fair. I refer to the capital gains tax. The Opposition was going to abolish that tax, but it has said nothing since the election to lead us to believe that it would not abolish it if it had its chance. Without a capital gains tax, what we saw in the Australian economy were the paper shufflers. As the Royal Commissioner pointed out, when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, what we saw was the biggest growth industry, and that is tax avoidance, because there was then no capital gains tax. We have put it in, and the Opposition will remove it again. The Opposition has learned nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that the capital gains tax is one of the fairest measures that this Government introduced, but the Opposition opposed it then. I do not know when we come around to the next election whether it will again be the policy of the Opposition, because we do not know where it stands; it changes so much. Even worse than promising to get rid of the capital gains tax, it was going to make it retrospective for eight years and give a huge windfall to all those people with those unrealised gains. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, all honourable members remember the debates in this House about the fringe benefits tax and the way in which the Opposition opposed that initiative. It was all right for executives to take their income as fringe benefits and pay no tax on it, whereas the poor old mug out there in the work force and the blue collar workers were paying all the tax on all their income because they received it in cash. The Opposition opposed that move, as it did the capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government there has been a revolution in superannuation, by making it available to everyone in the Australian community. Under the Liberals executives were okay, because it was another of their fringe benefits, but this Government has made sure that everyone in the Australian community has access to superannuation. Of course, the matter of public importance refers to the change of Government policy. Let us look at some of those policies and see how bad they are. In relation to training, if Australian industry is to compete on the international scheme it really needs a skilled work force. Under the educational policies of this Government, 150,000 extra places have been provided in higher education for young Australians. That is a revolution by Australian standards. If anyone wishes to look at the economic well-being of the country the education system should be examined, because I believe that the education system is the one determinant that separates those countries that are doing well from those countries that are not. I suppose that Japan is a good example where they invest in education, in their people, because it does not have resources. Australia is resource rich but the amount of money we used to spend on education was pitiful, so the Government has provided an extra 150,000 higher education places. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came to office the retention rates were one of the lowest of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries but that has increased from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. Many of those young people came from areas that were previously deprived of educational opportunities, but that will not be the case in the future because, when they get to higher education, there will be places there for them. Over 1.6 million jobs have been created. They are not bad policies; we would not want to change them. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 250,000 extra young people are now in formal training compared with when the Opposition was in Government. I remember that, because I used to work as an electrician in technical and further education. I remember the skills policies of the Opposition. Its policy was to bring out another boat load from somewhere. Its policies did not allow for the training of local people but, rather, just bringing some more people out from England. This Government believes that the best way this country can ensure it has the skilled work force for the future is to make sure we train our own and those figures I have just read prove that this Government has outstripped all previous governments in ensuring that happens. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to change the way in which industry conducts itself. Award restructuring is something the Opposition never knew about when it was in Government but that is something that is happening under this Government, by cooperation between the Government and the trade union movement. Indeed, the Australian Council of Trade Unions is the vehicle for change. It is ensuring that the award restructuring, which is so long overdue in Australia, is actually happening. We would not want to change that policy. I do not know what is the alternative policy of the Opposition; it does not have one. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last election campaign the County Natwest Bank did an analysis of the wages policy of the Opposition that backs up everything we have been saying about industry, because wages policy is another central area. The bank's assessment of the policy of the Opposition policy stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Sounds like Thatcherism . . . Could it succeed and generate a productivity breakthrough? Not unless the ensuing recession changed community wage expectations and dissolves decades of attachment to the tenets of Australia's centralised wage settling system. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not read it all, but the introduction will give some idea that the bank did not have any faith in what the Opposition was putting to the Australian people. It comes as no surprise that, when the Liberal Party went to the last election, is suffered its fourth defeat and nothing we have seen since the election campaign leads us to believe that it has any hope of changing the laziness that it has displayed in the past seven years. I am sure that, when we go to the election in 1993, the Liberal Party will get beaten for a fifth time. The matter of public importance was not even discussed by the Opposition and we should look at matters of public importance to ensure that when the Opposition puts them up, it gets up and speaks to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of the Reserve Bank, 60 Collins Street, Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work is for refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia premises at 60 Collins Street, Melbourne. The Melbourne Branch of the Reserve Bank has operated from its current premises since initially completed in 1966. Although structurally and externally sound and well located for the bank's purposes, the premises are in need of substantial internal refurbishment to meet current standards for accommodation, amenity and operational efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed scope of work will involve upgrading of all office floor levels, including removal of asbestos fire retardant material in ceiling spaces, and installation of new ceilings, carpets and building services, including extension of a fire sprinkler service to all levels of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in October 1989 and the Committee tabled its report last December. Regrettably, pressure of business prevented an expediency motion being put before the recent election announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> In its report the Committee raised three matters of concern. Firstly, it sought guarantees from the Reserve Bank that strict safety measures would be adhered to during asbestos removal. The Bank gives this assurance. Specialist consultants are being employed to undertake air monitoring, and Worksafe Australia will monitor the removal process. Removal will be carried out strictly in terms of current codes and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee asked the Reserve Bank to re-examine its proposal to modify the ground floor facade at a cost of $800,000. The Committee expressed serious doubts that the expenditure was justified. The Reserve Bank has re-examined the proposal and in doing so sought the advice of two leading property consultants and the Australian Valuation Office. All three confirmed the importance of upgrading the foyer to maintain the attractiveness of the building to its rental tenants. After further consideration, the Bank made the commercial judgment that it should adopt a revised foyer design at the reduced cost of $700,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also asked the Reserve Bank to consider the provision of additional toilets for the disabled. These will be provided. The Committee recommends that the refurbishment should proceed at an estimated cost of $25m at June 1989 prices. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

There has not been a long delay in this case. The Public Works Committee was able to deal quite expeditiously with this matter. The project can now go ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very sorry to disappoint the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), but we intend to proceed with this motion. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction of Australian Pavilion at Expo 92 in Seville, Spain. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion seeks exemption of the proposal to construct an Australian pavilion at Expo 92 in Seville from reference to the Public Works Committee (PWC) on the grounds of urgency. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) accepted the invitation by King Juan Carlos I of Spain during the royal visit in 1988 to participate in the universal exposition to be held in Seville in 1992. The exposition is being held in 1992 to commemorate the fifth centenary of Columbus's voyage to the new world in 1492. Already in excess of 100 countries have confirmed their participation in the Expo. Each country is required to build its own pavilion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has agreed to a budget of $25m at February 1989 prices and prevailing exchange rate. The pavilion and exhibits comprised about $14.3m of the above, with the balance being attributed to fees and operating costs. Australia's pavilion will promote Australia's tourism and trade interests in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The applicability of the Public Works Committee Act to the Expo 92 project was confirmed by the Attorney-General's Department only in early April 1990. Until that time it had been understood that overseas exposition projects had automatic exemption from PWC consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Act was amended in 1981 to cover works outside Australia and also to cover all departmental proposals which used appropriated funds, the Act has always exempted works for inter-governmental bodies. These are defined as `a body corporate or an unincorporated body established by, or in accordance with the provision of, an agreement between the Commonwealth . . . and the Government of another country . . .'. The legal argument is too complex to canvass here but the fact remains that referral to the Parliamentary Public Works Committee would result in significant timing constraints and increase in costs. With the calling of the election the normal process involving all steps from referral to expediency would preclude project committal before August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The exposition is scheduled to open in April 1992. In order to allow for exhibits to be in place and for the staff of the Australian pavilion to be fully trained in their various duties, it is essential that construction of the pavilion building be complete by September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The original timetable had envisaged the award of a piling contract in mid-April 1990, with the award of a contract for the pavilion works in June 1990. This allowed a minimum of float time and also sought to gain a price advantage by attempting to beat the major surge of parallel construction activity generated by other competing nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will appreciate that Seville is not a particularly large city and that the great interest in Expo 92 will severely strain construction capacity and inflate prices. It is estimated that each month's delay in committal will add at least $1m to construction costs, as well as greatly increase the risk of not completing the project on time. It is critical that piling for Expo 92 commence immediately and that the main building contract follow as soon thereafter as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As previously stated, the inability to commit the proposal in early April is already incurring additional cost and threatening timely completion. I have therefore moved that, under the provisions of section 18 (8) (b) of the Public Works Committee Act, it is expedient, on the grounds of urgency, for the Expo 92 proposal to proceed into construction without reference to the Public Works Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Opposition obviously does not oppose what is being done it is very reluctant to agree. Parliamentary accountability will not be as good as it ought to be. The Government will create a precedent by making this project urgent and forcing it through without referring it to the Public Works Committee, something that I hope it will not repeat without extraordinarily good reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fairly poor excuse to say that the Government was unaware that the Public Works Committee Act applied to this project until April 1990. The Government really ought to lift its game. It should have come to the last Parliament with the realisation that the Public Works Committee should be looking at this project. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to put pressure on the Parliament to accept this by threatening that each month's delay will add at least $1m to construction costs. That reasoning might equally be applied to the delays that the Government has probably incurred by calling an early election and not allowing the Parliament to sit earlier in the year. The Government has a bit to answer for. </PARA>
<PARA> As I was unavoidably detained, I would like to speak very briefly to the previous motion relating to the refurbishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia. While I agree with the Government's proposal I note that the Public Works Committee drew attention to the cost of modifying the ground floor facade, which was initially estimated to be $800,000. The proposal has been re-examined and the bank has made a commercial judgment that it should adopt a revised foyer design at the reduced cost of $700,000. It will be interesting to see the final figure on this area; to see whether there will be a real saving or whether the estimate will be exceeded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Public Works Committee I would like to make a few brief comments on the motion before the House. The Public Works Committee is most concerned that circumstances have arisen which will prevent this project being examined by the Committee. I do not criticise the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) but I am most certainly critical of the bureaucracy. It is clear from the correspondence provided to the Committee that Australian Construction Services was acting on an understanding of the Public Works Committee Act which, when tested, proved to be incorrect. The Committee will be briefed by ACS on this issue tomorrow and will be seeking a thorough explanation of all the circumstances involved. However, such a briefing is in no way a substitute for the public inquiry and report to Parliament which should have been undertaken by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only the Public Works Committee which is being bypassed but the Parliament itself, as the expenditure of some $25m will not be subjected to the scrutiny of a committee representing both Houses and comprising Government and Opposition members. I might add that in my experience of over five years on the Public Works Committee the projects that run into problems, in the main, are those that bypass the Committee. Why is this? It is for no other reason than that, by the time a project comes to the Committee, it is usually well investigated and well-honed. All the arguments, all the possible shortcomings, are ironed out. So even if the Committee in the main approves projects, they have been through the process, by the time they come to the Committee, of having had all those difficulties ironed out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee will be seeking an assurance from the Minister that this situation will not occur again and that in future his Department will not base actions on a flawed understanding of the Public Works Committee Act. Although this project is not coming to my Committee, we will most certainly be watching it. We will most certainly have questions to ask in this House if it comes in over $25m, which I suspect it will for the very fact that it has not been to our Committee. So although this reference has not been referred to my Committee, we will take it on board and watch its progress as if it had been referred to the Committee and will if necessary report back to Parliament on it. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we all appreciate and understand what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has just said but I would with respect say to him that he should not really abrogate so readily his responsibility and authority and power as Chairman of the Public Works Committee. In support of that might I say to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) that he really has just sailed through this one by the skin of his teeth because, although we are not going to oppose it, it being pointless to do so in terms of votes, nevertheless we want to register very strongly and put on the record-because I have a sneaking suspicion that one day we will be referring back to this debate-our extreme concern about the way this matter has been handled so far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me elaborate on that. Like many incidents in the life of the Hawke Government, it starts off with a royal touch, with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in confab with King Juan Carlos of Spain, the sort of activity that the Prime Minister likes to engage in to avoid contact with ordinary citizens of this country, at least as much as possible. The arrangement that he reached with King Juan Carlos that Australia should have an exhibit in Seville was made during the royal visit of the King of Spain here in 1988 and here we are today, with the Minister saying, `Quick, rush, hurry. We have to approve this so quickly that we cannot even go through the Public Works Committee'. It is an absurd argument to be advanced when the Government has known since 1988, on the plain facts that we have been given here, that this project is to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> So the first point to be made is that the Government starts off on a very wonky basis because it has had from 1988 to have put this project through the normal procedures of the Public Works Committee to ensure that it is subjected to close scrutiny. It does not say much for the public accountability of the Government to come along at this very late stage and say that the matter is now so urgent-since 1988-that we have to get this building up and its construction started in Seville without even having time for the Public Works Committee to examine the project. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before the honourable member for Throsby came into this chamber, the good thing about the previous item that we dealt with was that the Public Works Committee had disposed of that reference concerning the Reserve Bank in a short period of time and it did not contribute very much to delay at all. But in contrast, in this case the Government has had since 1988 to do something, apparently has done nothing and now comes along at the end of the day and says, `This matter must be approved as a matter of urgency'. It cannot even allow time for it to go through the Public Works Committee. That is the case that appears on the Minister's statement. If there are other facts to explain this delay then we will certainly give leave to the Minister to explain the delay. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the Government then falls back on the lame excuse that it asked advice from the Attorney-General's Department as to whether this project would be subject to the Public Works Committee and it got the opinion from the Attorney-General's Department only in early April 1990. Again, because the only facts we have are those in the Minister's statement, it seems that this is being put forward as the excuse. The Minister is really implying on the basis of this statement that the whole of the delay between 1988 and April 1990 is due to the Attorney-General's Department and the delay in its giving its opinion as to whether this project is subject to the Public Works Committee. Not only do I find that, in the first place, a very lame excuse but also it is besmirching the reputation of the Attorney-General's Department, which I am sure would have been able to give the Minister that opinion in a much shorter period of time. I hope those people in the Attorney-General's Department who read these remarks, or those who read them and can bring them to the notice of that Department, will have that besmirchment, if that is the correct word, of the Attorney-General's Department's reputation rectified as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not the end of the story because, on the basis of this statement made by the Minister, we get to the question of what exactly is going to happen now. We have set out in the Minister's sob story the fact that the pile driving contract should have been let in April 1990 if the job was going to go ahead on schedule. That clearly has not happened and the proposition is now put forward by the Minister in his statement that the pile driving contract for this project in Seville must be let immediately. What I would like to know is: How is the Government going to do that? Is it calling for tenders? Have tenders been let? I believe that the Parliament is entitled to know. There are millions of dollars at stake. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point now, and I will make it again a couple of times before I sit down, that the Government's track record on projects for expositions is not very good. The last one led to the resignation of a Minister because he misled the Parliament. The procedures that were followed in that case through the tender process were a complete and utter shambles. The Government had so many balls in the air it did not know who was blowing the whistle. That was a complete shambles from beginning to end. I hope that we are not about to see a repetition. </PARA>
<PARA> But I come back to the basic point, which is this, and which we are entitled to know: Has the Government called for tenders? Has it gone through the normal tender process? Is it proposing to go through the normal tender process? Is it getting some certificate of expediency to avoid following the Finance Department's regulations? Is it going to do all of that? We are entitled to know that and we believe the Parliament should be told. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point, which is related, is that it was to be in June 1990 that the building contracts were to be let. That, clearly, now is not going to happen, so we are told in the Minister's statement that the building contract itself will have to be let as soon as possible after the pile driving contract. That is what we have been told today. I again ask: bearing in mind that this building is to cost $14m, is this contract going out to tender? Is it going to be given to Warren Anderson or someone else?</PARA>

He may have resigned because he misled the Parliament, as he did, but eventually he would have had to resign anyway because of the shambles he presided over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say to the Minister for Small Business and Customs, who is at the table, that to move from Brown to Bolkus is not much of an improvement. The Minister for Small Business and Customs is responsible to this House for what happens about this case. We have been told by the Prime Minister, of course, that the Senate, where the Minister for Administrative Service (Senator Bolkus) is, does not count. Let me say to the Minister that he does count; he is responsible to us to make sure that this project is carried out in accordance with the law, propriety and commercial good sense. I believe we are entitled to know what the Minister is proposing to do about the contract for the building itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe also we are entitled to know why it is that when a project is to cost $25m-and we all know it is going to cost more than that; these things always seem to cost more than $25m under this Government-$14m of that is for the building and the rest is for fees and operating costs. Well, I know that some of the professional charges these days are a bit on the steep side--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Especially the legal profession-very much on the high side. But $14m is for the building and the rest, $11m, is apparently for fees and operating costs. The Minister must be employing a lot of high-priced quantity surveyors, architects and all the rest of them to get through $11m. How is the Minister proposing to do that? Will he be letting out the work-it is big work, costing millions of dollars-by tender? Is there to be a tender assessment panel set up for that procedure? The former Minister ran foul of exactly the same point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He also ran foul of the further point that I wish to make, that is, one does not just put up a building in Seville and leave it there. One has an Australian exhibit, and it was the Australian exhibit that was the area where the former Minister got into trouble. Apparently there were no procedures laid down as to precisely what sort of tender assessment panel the Minister had to set up to examine which was to be the lucky firm to provide the pavilion and the exhibit in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister set up his own tender assessment panel. He engaged in some activities which did not meet with the approval of many members of the Public Service-we all know that-and which eventually did not meet with the approval of a number of senior Ministers in this Government, who recommended to the Prime Minister that he give the former Minister the flick. The Minister should not let that happen to him. This is potentially what can happen when a Minister is dealing with these projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step in what we would like to know is: what is going to be done to the exhibit itself to present Australia to the rest of the world through the eyes of Seville? What sort of tender assessment processes is the Minister setting up? It is not enough to come along here and hold out this intimidation by saying that every month we delay this project now it is going to cost a further $1m. If we delay it, the Minister will be saying that we, the Opposition, are causing delay costing $1m a month, and clearly we are not going to be put into that position. The Minister has no excuse now for not bringing this in on budget price. He has no excuse for going ahead with shoddy procedures. We have warned him that we will observe very closely the procedures he follows on this and we will certainly scrutinise very closely what he does, because the track record in this regard has not been very good. The Expo Pavilion and project in Brisbane, so far as its construction and the contract was concerned, was a complete and utter shambles. We would strongly advise the Minister not to be misled by a fool like Bolkus, because he will lead the Minister up the garden path and he will end up having to resign himself. </PARA>

The most recent one I know about, which the honourable member for Throsby also knows about, is the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) project in Melbourne. Mr Deputy Speaker, can you believe this series of events? The Government let a contract for that building. The pile driving contract went ahead and it seems the only thing they found is water, seeing they were drilling on the banks of the Yarra River. The company that had the management contract for the project ended up walking out. Jennings has now come back in with some private deal which has not gone out to tender. This is a building for millions and millions of dollars and Jennings has said that it will build it for the Government provided the Government sells-and, I will bet, at bargain prices-all of these major blocks of land in Melbourne owned by the ABC. This is a private deal, not put out to tender, never presented as a package to the professions or the industry, and millions of dollars of public money are being exposed in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>

We say that we have very serious reservations about what the Government is doing in this case. The case the Minister has made out is not a justification for this matter not going to the Public Works Committee. We have severe reservations as to what the Minister is doing about this project and we will be watching it very closely to ensure that all the proper procedures are followed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to respond briefly to the wide-ranging debate that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) engaged in. This motion is to specifically exempt this project from Public Works Committee (PWC) reference and I would like to address that particular issue. Since 1981 the Public Works Act has clearly applied to government works outside of Australia. However, the Act has always exempted works of intergovernmental bodies. These are defined, as I said in the introductory speech, as a body corporate or an unincorporated body, if established by or in accordance with the provisions of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the Government of another country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was this provision which led the Australian Construction Services (ACS) to believe that, because of the formal participation contract, the Expo 92 project was exempt from the provisions of the Public Works Act. The ACS view was only recently challenged by the Department of Finance. Prior to that, no Australian Expo project had been subject to PWC examination. Quite apart from the intergovernmental aspects, Knoxville in 1982, New Orleans in 1984, Tsukuba in 1985 and Vancouver in 1986 were essentially fit-outs of buildings provided by the relevant Expo authorities. In the case of Brisbane, the building would not have been referable anyway because its estimated construction cost was less than $6m, excluding fit-out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to various bounty Acts. The Bill's major purpose is to implement certain initiatives arising from the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERTA). The 1988 review of that agreement resulted in an `agreed minute on industry assistance', signed on 21 June 1988, under which Australia and New Zealand agreed that, from 1 July 1990, neither country would pay production bounties or like measures on goods which are exported to the other country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year, as principal bounty Bills or bounty amendment Bills have been presented to the Parliament, a provision to preclude the bounty being paid on bountiable goods exported to New Zealand after 1 July 1990 has been inserted, to give effect to Australia's treaty commitment. In 1989 the Bounty (Ships) Act, and the Bounty (Photographic Film) Act both contained such provisions, in sections 9 and 8 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes to amend four current bounty Acts-the Bounty (Books) Act 1986, the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984, the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985 and the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981-to provide similarly that from 1 July 1990 bounty is not payable in respect of goods which are for export to New Zealand. The desired prohibition on payment of bounty will not, however, extend to goods exported through New Zealand to other destinations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments in this Bill are of a minor technical nature and are explained in greater detail in the clause notes to schedule 1 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. The opportunity has also been taken to repeal 10 superseded bounty Acts and three superseded subsidy Acts, as the relevant bounty or subsidy periods have expired, the time within which to make a claim has elapsed, and there is no outstanding prosecution or recovery action under any of them. The Acts proposed for repeal are in schedule 2 of the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor-General's address to the Parliament on the occasion of the opening of Australia's Thirty-sixth Parliament making, also, an historic fourth term for the Hawke Labor Government and a fifth consecutive term for the Australian Labor Party in Lilley, was remarkable for the visionary nature of its content.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recording advances and achievements of this Government in the areas of human rights; consumer and trade protection; education, employment and training; child care; women's health; and Aboriginal affairs, a strong element of social justice was apparent. </PARA>
<PARA> As a reflection of the very progressive role and high profile Australia has had on human rights initiatives, and in support of the special role we accord to the United Nations in the international pursuit of human rights, Australia has decided this year to again pursue a candidacy for election to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. We have been a member of the Commission in the past and, if elected, will use our membership to advance our international human rights concerns and commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been among the most active proponents of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, as well as the second optional protocol on the abolition of the death penalty. This country makes more bilateral human rights representations than is known to be the case for any other country. In the past 12 months Australia has raised more than 400 cases with 68 different countries covering both the plight of particular individuals and situations of widespread and systematic abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been a leading proponent and enforcer of sanctions against South Africa. We will continue them until there is clear and irreversible evidence that the apartheid system is, at last, being destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to be part of a Government which has given high domestic and international priority to the pursuit of such justice for individual human beings. That justice become apparent when one reads between the lines of program funding and policy initiatives to determine just who is affected by these initiatives. Such an exercise soon reveals that a large number of negative influences which have traditionally weighed down the life opportunities available to a sizeable minority of Australians have been reversed during the Hawke years resulting in positives such as jobs, education, training, housing and other doors to opportunity, once closed to all but the privileged, now standing, by degrees, from slightly ajar to wide open to Australians with special needs. This does not mean that these needs have been eradicated. Far from it. But a start has been made and a change of direction negotiated by accepting that a healthy nation does not develop from keeping the status quo for comparatively privileged, able Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to devote my comments in the Address-in-Reply to the special Australians who have to overcome specific obstacles to reach their potential, to the manner in which the Hawke Government has addressed policies to help overcome these obstacles and to future directions for Australians with special needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context I refer to the Job Search training program (JSTP) which aims to assist work-ready job seekers-particularly youth, sole parents and long term unemployed-to obtain employment by providing structured training on job search techniques and skills, and very successfully. The program comprises Job Search training courses and job clubs. The courses complement the Job Search allowance initiative for youth and is an important element in the Government's Newstart and job education and training (JET) strategies for long term unemployed people and sole parents. The program provides short term courses delivering instruction in job search techniques. Job clubs provide intensive, supervised training in job hunting over a three-week period, and Job Search training programs provide 20 hours of formal Job Search training. </PARA>
<PARA> The important part of these programs is the fact that they have assisted, and will continue to assist, thousands of disadvantaged job seekers-the ones who are always at the end of the employment line. </PARA>
<PARA> Another program aimed at opening doors of opportunity previously closed to Australians is the Aboriginal study assistance scheme, Abstudy, which provides financial and educational assistance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tertiary and secondary students to enable the attainment of educational levels commensurate with those of the general community. Abstudy income support assistance is provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students on the basis of need, assessed on an income test basis similar to that applied by Austudy which, itself, opens doors to the wide spread of young Australians who, in past decades, have been unable to further their study for financial reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the community question funding for Aboriginal help schemes such as Abstudy so I would like to point out that Abstudy is designed to assist in removing a number of disparities. The retention rate for Aboriginals to year 12 was 22 per cent in 1988 compared with 55 per cent for the wider Australian community. The participation rate in 1986 for Aboriginals of five to nine years of age was 82.2 per cent while it was 99 per cent in the wider Australian community and, in the past, of course, it was much worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The participation rate in 1986 for Aboriginals aged 18 to 20 years of age in technical and further education was 4 per cent compared with 22.7 per cent in the wider Australian community. In 1986 0.6 per cent of the Aboriginal population were undertaking formal award courses compared with 2.5 per cent for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Advances in Aboriginal education since March 1983 which can be, in part, attributed to Abstudy are the year 12 retention rates for Aboriginal students which have increased from 11 per cent in 1982 to 22 per cent in 1988, and the increase in Aboriginal graduates from 80 in 1983 to 214 in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> Another grouping of Australians with special needs are those people who are labouring against a specific disability. The special education program provides assistance to education authorities, and non-government, voluntary and community agencies to improve the quality and coverage of educational services for children with disabilities or living in institutions. In particular, this program caters for the specific needs of target groups of children with disabilities, such as children with severe and multiple disabilities, children with emotional disturbances, children of ethnic communities with disabilities, Aboriginal children with disabilities, isolated children, gifted and talented children and girls, all with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of children benefiting from the program in 1987 exceeded 100,000, with the major proportion of these being in the government sector. Similarly, in the order of 1,800 teachers and teacher aides were employed under the program in schools and organisations to improve the quality and coverage of educational services and programs for disabled or institutionalised children. A vast need still exists, but over time the number of institutions receiving funding under the program has increased. It must continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government initiatives on award restructuring will also open many doors previously shut to Australian workers. It will lead to the training and reskilling of people, many of them women or arrivals from other cultures, people who have been left behind, made redundant in the wake of the surge of progress which has swept the privileged sector of the globe during this century. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability to adequately express oneself is basic to the resolution of any problem facing mature people, across the spectrum of social contexts, from the marketplace to the boardroom. Award restructuring initiatives are a recognition of the reality that the technological age, while it has offered rewards to specific sectors in our society and can therefore be seen to have advantaged health, science, education and trade, has completely neglected-and in many instances created further problems-the individual needs of the mass of working men and women. The architects of award restructuring, government and unions, are to be congratulated on designing a practical process of redirecting the energies of men and women who have been or who could be made redundant by machines. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, a large number of people will not reap the benefits of award restructuring. In fact, they will be marginalised. I refer to the more than one million Australian adults who cannot perform basic calculations or undertake everyday reading and writing tasks. Adult literacy is basic to training and retraining. It is basic to social justice, which is the central aim of Labor policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent authoritative surveys indicate that about 15 per cent of Australian adults cannot adequately read, write or do simple sums. The proportion of unemployed people with severe literacy and numeracy problems is more like 20 per cent. This is a clear indication of the extent of the disadvantage being endured by job seekers who are not literate. The ratio of prison inmates thus afflicted is even more revealing. About 40 per cent of Australia's prison population lacks the simple skills of literacy and numeracy. The ramifications of this factor in terms of social justice are apparent. It begs the question as to just what effect the lack of these skills will have on the future directions of people growing into early adulthood who cannot achieve in the classroom because they cannot express themselves, people who are left to languish on school benches because they lack the self-esteem needed to inform the teachers of their problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has certainly made a real start on addressing this problem. The Commonwealth supports adult literacy through a number of programs in several departments. Through the Department of Employment, Education and Training the Federal Government has initiated the vocationally-oriented education and literacy program, at a cost of $6.7m. Under this, there is a $1.1m adult literacy program, a $1.4m non-government adult education scheme and a $4.2m advanced English for migrants scheme. These courses are largely conducted through colleges of technical and further education. The Department of Employment, Education and Training also funded an adult literacy action campaign in 1987-88 and in 1988-89, at a cost of $1.96m and $2m, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> This initiative was designed to `seed' innovations in advancing literacy in the States and Territories. Through the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, a total of $75m is committed to the Australian migrant education program, while the Department of Aboriginal Affairs incorporates literacy programs in various Aboriginal education programs. As well, at 230 Department of Social Security offices across Australia there is a designated literacy person. But more is needed. Adult literacy is a major social justice issue and as such should be included in the objectives of our social justice policy and in assessments made to the social justice impact of programs. A person with few or no literacy and numeracy skills cannot participate equally in community life. Such people are denied opportunities and choices that are available to the majority of adults. It is likely that these inadequate skills and their consequences are likely to be repeated in their children. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the human and social costs, it is estimated that this problem cost industry more than $3.2 billion every year. I therefore propose that the long-term objectives coming out of International Literacy Year in Australia should include a massive reduction in the incidence of adults who are functionally illiterate. At present, one million people-or over 10 per cent of the adult population-the majority of whom are from English-speaking backgrounds, are affected. </PARA>
<PARA> A massive increase in the number of adults enrolled in adult literacy programs, including the widespread extension of workplace basic education programs, should be introduced. At present fewer than 30,000 Australians are involved in such programs. An excellent step forward would be a national basic adult education strategy, as proposed in the April 1990 report of a strategic review of Commonwealth-State adult literacy expenditure, including a plain English policy in all Federal agencies. This would extend the policies of this Government and the excellent work of the International Literacy Year secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of people in Australia who have missed the boat as far as opportunities to broaden their potential are concerned. This Government has certainly moved in many instances for the first time since Federation to ensure that programs are targeted not just to retain the status quo of those who are already able people, who already have family support, who already have their full faculties and who themselves have to face a lifetime of striving and work to achieve their potential. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing, when reading between the lines of policies and programs of this Government, is that a new direction is being forged, so that those people who start behind the eight-ball, in not having all of those inbuilt opportunities that able people have, are recognised for all that they can offer to our society and are given the opportunity through these programs and through the assistance of able people to move to take their rightful place in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to move forward and fulfil his or her potential. I say again that much has been done by this Government. I am extremely grateful for that on behalf of the number of people who are needing this assistance. There is more to be done. I look forward to working with this Government and, in many cases, with the Opposition to ensure that these needed facilities become a reality for that most important minority grouping of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, to be chosen as a representative in this place is a very great honour. It is also a great responsibility. The people of my electorate have great hopes and expectations of what I may be able to achieve on their behalf and I hope that, given time, at least some of those expectations can be fulfilled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank the people of Wide Bay for giving me this opportunity. I particularly thank the many Party supporters and friends who ensured that the National Party of Australia received such an excellent result in Wide Bay.</PARA>
<PARA> My philosophy is straightforward. I believe that government policy should support the family, encourage initiative and reward achievement. This philosophy will inevitably result in a more productive workplace, lower taxes and a fairer society. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australians today consider their Federal Parliament to be remote and even out of touch with their needs and aspirations. There has been a tendency for the Government and the bureaucracy to lock themselves away in Canberra and to lose touch with what is happening in the real world. Consequently, the people become disillusioned with their capacity to influence the political process and eventually they lose interest in Federal affairs altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> This country is facing major economic and social problems and this legislature should be seen to be fully relevant and occupying itself in seeking solutions to those major difficulties. We need to be planning in this decade for the Australia of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> Wide Bay is one of the original Federal electorates and its history can be traced back to Federation in 1901. Its first member was a former Labor Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Andrew Fisher, who served until 1915. </PARA>
<PARA> My predecessor, Clarrie Millar, was first and foremost a parliamentarian. He strongly believed in this institution and was firmly committed to its forms and processes. He earned universal commendation in his role as Deputy Speaker. I was pleased that he was present in the gallery last week during the election of the Deputy Speaker to hear the many commendatory remarks from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other honourable members about his contribution to that office. I owe Clarrie a great deal. I acknowledge greatly his contribution and assistance both during the election campaign and since I have taken up this office. I owe him more than most-I am even married to his former secretary. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, despite its vast area, is now one of the most urbanised nations of the world. Even in electorates like Wide Bay, which commentators would regard as rural, most people live in the provincial cities and towns-cities like Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Gympie and towns like Kingaroy, Murgon, Nanango, Wondai, Imbil and about 50 more. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably every rural industry in Australia can be found somewhere in the electorate of Wide Bay. Tourism is, though, now a major contributor to our economy, with Fraser Island, Hervey Bay and the Bunya Mountains being perhaps the best known attractions. I served for four years as chairman of what is now the Fraser Coast-South Burnett Regional Tourism Board Ltd and had the privilege of promoting this region around the country and helping to build it into one of the fastest growing family holiday destinations in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragedy to see the decline in the number of farmers in Australia. But the rural population in areas like Wide Bay has not declined. These days the empty farm houses are being filled by a new type of rural resident-city people who are escaping the rat race and looking for a pleasant and fulfilling country lifestyle. But there are nowhere near enough jobs for these new residents. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that we recognised this new population shift into rural areas. I suppose it says something about our cities but it also means that there is an urgent need for services and facilities in these growing rural residential areas to match the new demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those moving to rural lifestyles are a part of the great migration from southern States to Queensland that has been occurring over recent years. Around 50,000 people a year have been escaping from the Labor regimes in the south to live in the progressive and dynamic Queensland environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Queensland now too has fallen to the Australian Labor Party machine and one can only hope that this aberration is of such short term duration that Queensland's fundamentally sound and vibrant economy will not be given the Keating, Burke, Cain, Bannon and Wran treatment. The signs are not good. Queensland has now had six months of Goss Labor and in all that time there has not been a single major new project announced. Indeed, several exciting new developments which the previous Government had brought close to fruition have now been put on hold or could be lost altogether. The Gladstone steelworks and the exciting Cape York space project have been stalled and they run the risk of being lost altogether. The cranes are coming down and the Premier admits that he cannot even guarantee to keep the lights on any longer.</PARA>
<PARA> In his maiden speech, Clarrie Millar found it necessary to devote considerable time to defending the electorate's hardwood timber industry. Sixteen years on, the battle has not been won. There is still pressure to list the major source of our hardwood timber industry, Fraser Island, for World Heritage purposes. Let us make it abundantly clear: 90 per cent or more of the local people do not favour World Heritage listing of Fraser Island. Neither, I might add, do the two local State Labor members of parliament. They know that there will be no benefits in locking away vast sections of our region. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraser Island is no pristine wilderness. It has been logged for over 100 years. Fraser Island timber was used in the Suez Canal. The island has been sandmined and has a number of tourist resorts. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for listing is pitifully threadbare but that has not stopped the conservation movement in the past. Already, the professional demonstrators are moving up from Gippsland to organise their usual media stunts-choosing a sunny Queensland location for their winter protest venue. It is high time that the Government stood up to these radical green protesters. It should know that these professionals will not be satisfied with just one more concession. What is needed is sustainable commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> Timber is the only renewable building material and is by far the most environmentally friendly. The alternative to carefully managed Australian logging is importing timber products from the clear-felled jungles of South East Asia or South America. We should be encouraging the Australian timber industry as an environmentally positive thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The first member for Wide Bay, Andrew Fisher, came from the Queensland Parliament. My background includes 14 years in local government. In fact, I am still the Chairman of the Kingaroy Shire Council. </PARA>
<PARA> All the cliches about local government being closest to the people are, of course, true. But that very fact makes it the tier of government the furthest away from the Federal Government, which has drifted so far away from the people over recent times. The Federal Government starves the States because it cannot balance its own Budget and then the States pass on those cuts to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> The major issue confronting local government and very much of Australia these days is the question of road funding. Labor's cutbacks in this regard are a national disgrace. They are already leading to an irretrievable breakdown of our nation's road assets. Some local authorities in my area have already been told that they can expect within two years not to have any funds at all for new road works. Labor has trebled fuel taxation but has frozen road funding for six years. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the Opposition's election platform, which was supported by every motoring organisation, every local government organisation and every rural organisation in the land, touched some raw nerves on the opposite side. One of the real tragedies of the election result is that we will not have the opportunity to put those election promises into place and in three years time even that amount of extra road funding will not be enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to again look at its miserly attitude towards road funding. If the roads in honourable members' own electorates are not bad enough they should come and look at mine. We still have highways that are not sealed, maintenance that is deferred for years and even a section of the national highway which will still be a goat track at the turn of this century.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been built on its great primary industries. Early in our history our country enjoyed one of the highest standards of living in the world. We reached that pre-eminent position because our rural and mining industries were beginning to prosper. Despite continuing attempts since that time to foster secondary industry, our prosperity has continued to depend on the performance of the primary sector. We should, of course, strive to develop industries in other areas where we have particular skills. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we do nothing to develop a successful secondary industry by denigrating primary industry. We do not make one man rich by making another poor. Instead of regarding our primary industries as somehow inferior or beneath the dignity of a modern and progressive country, we should be proud of the achievements of our farmers and miners and do what we can to enhance their profitability. The primary sector still has enormous capacity to rescue Australia from the economic precipice, if only it can be given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no country in the world that treats its farmers worse than Australia. The Third World nations, which battle with the risk of starvation, know that they need to encourage their food producers. The great international economies such as the United States of America and Europe recognise the essential part that rural industries play in making those economies great. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the attitude is so different. This Government has presided over the greatest persecution and exodus of farmers in our nation's history. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much talk about the need to develop a level playing field. Internationally, the Australian Government's efforts to break down world trade barriers are to be commended. However, despite the numerous conferences and trade groups meetings, little progress, if any, is being made. Domestically little progress, if any, has been made to break down the industrial rorts and feather bedding which entrench structural inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> We have anything but a level playing field. Australian farmers are tilling a totally different kind of paddock than exists in the rest of the world. Australia's policy of unilaterally eliminating trade barriers and opening up its markets indiscriminately is foolish. Other countries dump their unwanted and subsidised products in this country and give us nothing in return. </PARA>
<PARA> There are few Australian primary industries which are not currently under threat from cheap imports. An Australian industry should not be abandoned just because it cannot compete with imports from a country that has labour costs of a dollar a day. An Australian industry is not inefficient just because it cannot compete with imports from a country with subsidised production costs or domestic price support programs. An Australian industry cannot be expected to compete with a country which does not have the health standards, restrictive work practices and the repressive taxation regime which Australians have to endure. </PARA>
<PARA> Around 10 per cent of our monthly trade deficit is coming from food imports. In a wonderfully productive country such as Australia we have $160m a month of food imports. We once exported these commodities; now we eat other people's food. With our massive trade deficit why are we importing pineapples from an American company in Thailand while $1m worth of Australian pineapples rot in the field? Just the threat of subsidised Canadian pork imports has been enough to slash the price of Australian pigs to below the cost of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Dozens of these industries will disappear altogether unless they are given a fair go, a level playing field. These industries are not large or wealthy enough to finance public relations campaigns to highlight their problems or to fund Industry Commission submissions or anti-dumping inquiries. The National Farmers Federation was keen to take their money for its fighting fund but has lost its way in academic debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong case for pre-emptive anti-dumping measures such as apply in other countries. But also let us make sure that the Australian shopper is aware that foreign food imports are frequently produced using chemicals which are banned in this country, using farm practices which are unacceptable in Australia and with health standards and residue limits that would not meet Australia's stringent requirements. Some of these imports even have the potential to introduce new diseases or pests to Australia. The Australian housewife who buys Hungarian baked beans or Israeli peanuts is contributing just as surely to the national trade deficit as is the high flying entrepreneur or the man who wears Italian suits. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems have come to a head in my electorate over recent months. Five hundred farmers crowded into the Wondai Town Hall recently in a mood of sheer desperation. The district bankers say that almost half the peanut and crop farmers of the area now have no equity in their properties. With interest rates at 22 per cent, a debt doubles in three years. Land values have halved and many farm service industries have closed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said that by 1990 no child would live in poverty, but nearly all the farm children of the South Burnett are living in households that have had negative incomes for the last three years. The South Burnett is not a marginal farming area that has been worked out over the years. It is one of the richest and most productive areas in the country. It was one of the first in Australia to put in practice complete conservation programs. The farmers of the area have survived droughts and floods for four generations. What they cannot survive are the bad seasons plus an uncaring Government-a Government that has deliberately imposed high interest rates and repressive taxation, eliminated disaster relief programs and encouraged unrestricted dumping of competing products. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia faces a difficult period ahead. Our nation has not taken advantage of the improved world economy over recent years. At a time when commodity prices were comparatively high we developed major trade deficits and enormous debts. Now Australia seems to be entering a depression at a time when the world economy is weakening. We have squandered the good times and now we are paying the price. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record does not match the rhetoric. Labor's records pile up in an inglorious heap-record taxes, record debt, record interest rates, record bankruptcies and record social decline. Tax has become a millstone around the neck of every Australian industry and business. The only reward for energy, enthusiasm, enterprise and thrift is taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> It has often been said that Australia is the lucky country, but it has not been all luck. Australia became a great nation because there were people who were prepared to put in the effort and endure hardship whenever it was needed-the explorers who sought out the land, the pioneers who opened it up, the engineers who built our cities and bridges, the women who cared for their families and the soldiers who fought to protect it. These people did not look to the government or their fellow man to do the job for them. They did not demand their rights and entitlements as so many do today. </PARA>
<PARA> I fear that we have lost the momentum of our national growth. Has this generation decided that after all the effort we can now live on the fruits of those labours?</PARA>
<PARA> The country spends its time arguing about how to divide up the cake, forgetting that the cake is long gone. When someone tries to add to the cake, we find all sorts of obstacles to put in his way, and if perchance he happens to succeed we legislate to make sure he does not do it again. </PARA>
<PARA> The lucky country may still have one more chance. Australia is strategically located in the fastest growing sector of the globe. Within my lifetime this South East Asian quarter will be the most important economic arena in the world. It has a huge population and escalating demand. There is only one country in this area that has a land mass which even approaches Australia and that is China. It reproduces our population every 42 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has bountiful resources and is a natural supplier of raw materials, primary products, food and fibre, education and tertiary services for this next economic beehive of the world. We have another opportunity for national greatness but only if we are prepared to grasp it, to encourage industry and initiative, and to support those who are prepared to give it a go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) on his election and on his maiden speech. I would love to debate many of the things he said and I look forward to doing so in the future. Given that it was his maiden speech I will not comment any further at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want simply to draw attention to some of the very important policies in the Governor-General's Speech. It seemed to me that a lot of the proposals and commitments the Government made in the Governor-General's Speech were given less than adequate attention in the press. Perhaps it is an example of good news receiving less attention than does conflict, but there are a great many policies to which the Government gave commitment in this Speech which are very important and which are major steps forward in policy development in Australia. All those policies were linked to two overriding goals which were described, firstly, as the establishment of a stronger, more competitive and environmentally sustainable Australian economy; and, secondly, the creation of a fairer and more compassionate Australian society. Those two goals seem to me to be very well expressed because they are linked to the promise to increase security in an environmentally responsible way and to make Australia a fairer and more compassionate society, which has been the commitment of the Australian Labor Party throughout its history and on which there have been great achievements during the last seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the Speech, firstly, attention was given to the Australian economy. The Governor-General drew attention to the Government's major achievements-for example, the amazingly rapid growth of business investment. Business investment has grown in real terms by about 10 per cent a year in each of the last four years. We are fortunate that national income has grown during those years by about 4 per cent, but 10 per cent real growth in business investment is amazingly rapid and lays a very firm foundation for growth in production and productivity during the coming years. That has made possible a growth in employment that has also been remarkably rapid. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government was elected, the growth in employment has been well over 1 3/4 million jobs because of the stability in the labour market and in incomes which the accord has created. It is remarkable that employment growth, which the Government promised would be half a million in its first three years, was a couple of hundred thousand greater than that in the first three years. When that half million growth in employment was promised in the March 1983 election, people said it was overly ambitious and impossible to achieve. That rate was overachieved, and since then overachievement has continued. So we have had sustained steady growth in employment, allowing for a reduction in unemployment, and unemployment is now just over 6 per cent. That, of course, is still too high. Employment growth must be one of the Government's main continuing objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that in the Opposition's election policies there was no commitment at all to growth in employment. That was completely neglected in its economic policies. That growth in employment has been due not only to the growth in investment but also to the achievements of the effective incomes policy, the accord, which has allowed for a reduction in real unit labour costs. That is an innovation in Australian economic policy-making which has been a major success and which, astonishingly, the Opposition says it will abolish. It is amazing that the Opposition should be proposing to discard the accord and the effective incomes policy on which it is based when it has resulted in the most successful period of employment growth in the whole postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Governor-General went on to talk about the role of the Industry Commission. That will be one of the principal bodies responsible for the micro-economic reforms which everyone on both sides agrees are important. To draw attention to just one element of the Industry Commission's tasks, it is going to receive a reference on railways. Railway investment has been neglected in Australia for the last decade and a half. It is very important that we build up the effectiveness of our railway system. One aspect of that which is also mentioned in the Governor-General's Speech is the proposal to establish a national rail freight authority and a national rail freight organisation to implement that proposal. That seems to me to be a very sound initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The prices and incomes policy is also being supported by the Prices Surveillance Authority. That is to continue to have a major role in micro-economic reform, particularly for the benefit of consumers. Astonishingly that too was one of the things that the Opposition said it would abolish. What that Authority does is scrutinise the price structure in particular industries and recommend price reductions or slower price increases where that is possible. It would be simply crazy to abolish that moderate and rigorous Authority. I am delighted to see that the Government is maintaining it and enhancing its effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in the economic area the Government proposes to simplify the income tax system. I doubt that there would be a single person in Australia who would not welcome that goal. The Government promises to do that in ways that maintain the progressivity of the tax system. That is in sharp contrast to the Opposition, which talked about having a two-tier tax structure that would have greatly reduced the progressivity of the tax system. If we want to have a fair system, one in which low income earners pay a smaller proportion of their income and high income earners pay a somewhat higher proportion of their income, then we must have a progressive tax system. This Government has maintained that and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Government will continue with its approach to the restructuring of awards. That involves the simplification of awards and amalgamation of the very complex pattern of awards. It will contribute to creating opportunities for advancement for more employees. It will also contribute to trade union rationalisation along industry lines, which will make for more effective industrial relations. The evidence from overseas is that the larger the union and the more clearly it is based on an industry structure, the more responsible and effective those unions are not only in negotiating sound conditions for their employees but also in resolving conflict. This is a major step forward in providing a structure for our industrial relations system which is likely to be more peaceable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a commitment in the Speech also to the establishment of cooperative research centres. Nothing could be more important to building up the dynamism of the Australian economy than to increase funding for research and development. I am delighted to see that the Government is promising to allocate up to $100m after five years for these 50 or so cooperative research centres. The centres will allow for the combination of the efforts of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), universities and other research centres. They will concentrate research in areas where we have effective research under way already. They will be a stimulus to increasing the excellence of Australian research, which is absolutely essential if we are going to find the niches in international trade where we can excel and build up our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not only increase support for public research and development but also it will maintain the generous research and development tax concessions that are already in place of 150 per cent up to 1993, and 125 per cent up to 1995, so that provides a strong incentive for the private sector to build up its research effort. I am glad to see that part of the increased funding for research will go for a new forest research laboratory for the CSIRO in Tasmania and a tropical rainforest centre in North Queensland. Everyone concerned about the environment will welcome those two initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Speech also promises to continue with phased tariff reductions and that approach is complementary to our leadership of the Cairns group, which is negotiating for reduced agriculture protection in Europe, North America and Japan through the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and it is a necessary policy to give us moral authority when we are arguing that other countries should also reduce their tariffs. It will also contribute to increasing our competitiveness, and to increasing the access to markets here for developing countries, which is important if we are to provide opportunities for them to increase the rate of their development. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned some of the initiatives in the transport area, but there is a clear commitment to upgrading the national transport infrastructure and to improving the efficiency of our transport systems. A couple of years ago I tabled in Parliament a report in which the committee strongly recommended that funding for public investment to build up our national infrastructure should be increased, so I wholeheartedly welcome this commitment to increasing attention to the national transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that the Government can do to increase the efficiency of the whole economy is to maintain the best possible national infrastructure not only in the transport sector but also in power, other aspects of communications, water, sewerage and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the postwar period there has been a tendency for public investment to fall. Public investment as a proportion of national income peaked at around 10 per cent in about 1950 and it is now less than 6 per cent. That may mean that the public infrastructure is being used more efficiently-it certainly does-but it also suggests that there may be areas where the infrastructure needs to be expanded more rapidly or maintained more effectively. I think that many people would like to see increased expenditure on aspects of that national infrastructure, so the commitment by the Government to give the national transport infrastructure more attention is very welcome. Included in that, by the way, is a commitment to increasing the uniformity in regulation of road use, breaking down differences between the States and improving the safety standards for our roads, which is something that every person who drives on the road will welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a commitment also to reform the Broadcasting Act and that will strengthen the effectiveness of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It will also ensure that the community will have increased accessibility to broadcasting. The Government has a fine record in many aspects of education and there is a strong commitment in the Speech to higher national standards at all levels in the education process. I hope that that will involve a commitment to increased expenditure, particularly on tertiary education. I notice that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is in the House, so I am sure he is listening to these remarks. I urge him to urge his colleagues to increase funding for universities and technical and further education colleges because there is an increased demand for places in those tertiary and post-secondary colleges and universities. There is a problem of overcrowding in some of them already, so I think that there is a strong case for increasing, as rapidly as Budget parameters will allow, the expenditure on those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a strong commitment in the Speech also to improving the supply and affordability of child-care. That has already been dealt with by some other speakers in this debate so I will not go over it again, but it is something of great concern to many of my constituents, and the commitments that were made here have been very warmly welcomed by them. One of the particular innovations in this speech is a commitment to improve the living conditions of people in the outer fringes of our major cities and in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA> Some important initiatives are outlined-improvements in public transport and services and one which I think is particularly important is the establishment of family resource centres and marriage counselling and family mediation services. I think that there has been a tendency for governments to feel that those areas were outside their control, but I think also that, through better funding of marriage counselling and family mediation, a lot can be achieved in reducing conflict within families and in preventing, therefore, family breakdown. I would have thought that some additional expenditure on those areas was likely to be highly cost effective in reducing the damage to family life. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of this important Speech. One particularly strong area relates to environmental strategy. A whole series of new initiatives are promised there, but just one final point I would like to make is that it is very good to see the commitment in the foreign affairs area where the Government will maintain its record of assistance to developing countries. Its record of assistance to developing countries has not been the strongest aspect of its performance to date, and I am pleased to see that here is a specific commitment to aid to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Government repeats its commitment to the target of overseas aid of 0.7 per cent of national income. Our record at present is only 0.33 per cent, which is much better than the Opposition promised in the election campaign. It was saying that it would take another $100m out of it, and perhaps it meant $200m. If we are making a proper contribution to development of the developing countries within our region, I believe we must aim to build up our overseas aid as rapidly as we can, so that commitment is important also. </PARA>
<PARA> This Speech stands in strong contrast to the policies with which the Opposition went to the election. The Opposition's policies would have been destructive, unjust and Thatcherite, in fact, in orientation. Australia is fortunate that the Labor Party was re-elected. This election was one of the most important in the postwar period, because the Opposition was proposing more destructive and more conservative policies than any major party has proposed in the postwar period. It was therefore extraordinarily important that Labor won this election so that it can continue with the humane, compassionate, fair and effective policies with which it has governed for the past seven years. I strongly endorse this Speech by the Governor-General. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my congratulations to the Speaker on his re-election. When I first entered this chamber I felt an overwhelming sense of pride-a sense of pride in having the privilege of representing the huge and diverse electorate of McEwen. I thank my family and all the loyal supporters who have made this possible. No one person could accomplish this task on his or her own. I acknowledge that a very important person of this task force, my husband, is present today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also felt a sense of awe as through my mind flashed the images of those great Australian figures who have spoken in this House before me from both sides of the chamber and the fantastic debates which have crucially altered so much of Australia's history. Their aura lingers still. It is a matter of pride for all of us who are privileged to sit here that we follow in their footsteps. Unfortunately, we are no longer held in the same public esteem by large sections of the population but it is not beyond us to regain the status of earlier times. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still a young nation not burdened by the history of the old world. We do not have the entrenched hates, the blind prejudices which have passed beyond reason to become permanent grounds for conflict and strife. In fact, this magnificent building is really symbolic of us as a nation, erupting as it does from the earth towards the future. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is very easy in this magnificent building, insulated from the outside world and surrounded by the mechanics and trappings of power, to forget that all of us here are the servants of the Australian people, not their masters. It is also easy to forget, when we are bombarded by economic indicators, balance of trade deficits and statistics about average weekly earnings, that politics is about humanity-about the people of this country, their needs and their aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Statistics do not tell the whole story. If you are in one of the thousands of families or small businesses struggling to survive in these harsh economic times, statistics provide cold comfort. Rising unemployment may be, to quote the Treasurer (Mr Keating), a `beautiful set of numbers' but for the people who have lost their jobs or are about to, it is nothing but disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Society, like justice, functions best when in balance. Today our society is way out of balance. Everyone out there in society knows that this nation is currently in deep trouble. No matter which way one looks or at what sector-the economy, the environment, health, aged care, small business, local government or roads-it is obvious that the balance is not in equilibrium and is in danger of being destroyed. I come to this place as part of a team dedicated to finding ways of restoring that balance. How we go about finding those ways is the difference between us and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Forty-seven years ago in this same debate, a great lady, Dame Enid Lyons, rose to her feet for her maiden speech. Indeed, it was the first speech by a woman in the history of the House. The distinction of being the first woman in this place belongs only to her. But as the first woman to represent a rural Victorian electorate and the first Liberal Victorian female to be elected to this House, I am taking another step along the path paved by Dame Enid and her successors. Dame Enid, with the experience of the Great Depression behind her, told the House:</PARA>
<PARA>I know so well that fear, want and idleness, can kill the spirit of any people. But I know too that security can be bought at too great a cost-the cost of spiritual freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>That spiritual freedom, that individualism which is at the heart of liberalism, is what has led me into my Party and eventually to this place. Today I see in my electorate shadows of the same fears, want and enforced idleness which Dame Enid identified. As I travel around the electorate I am aware that the spirit of people is slowly being killed. Their willingness, hard work and dedication to building a future are being crushed by punitive taxation, eroding high inflation and high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the honour to represent one of the most beautiful electorates in Australia-the electorate of McEwen, named after that quintessential countryman, Sir John McEwen. It spreads from the northern developing edge of Melbourne across the Great Dividing Range to the productive plains and highlands of central Victoria where the merino and beef industries have contributed to the national economy since settlement; from the former goldfields of Castlemaine through the valleys and grasslands of the Goulburn river system to the snowfields of Mount Buller and the high country of the mountain cattlemen. </PARA>
<PARA> Uniquely among electorates McEwen possesses no one major centre; it is a collection of small centres, each with its own character and each with its own qualities. It consists of suburbs, small towns, resorts, farms, industries and vineyards sitting astride the main road and rail route between Sydney and Melbourne, first travelled by Hume and Hovell as they opened up the interior of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Fittingly, the independent nature of Australia is embodied in this electorate so aptly named after Sir John McEwen, for he was an individual of great determination and resolution. John McEwen was a great Australian nationalist who fought tooth and nail to establish manufacturing industries in this country realising that our strong rural industries would not be sufficient to carry us into the future. Long before others, he recognised the significance of post-World War II changes and fought to retain Australian ownership of our major industries. When John McEwen made his maiden speech on 15 November 1934 he spoke of the plight of unemployment and looked to new industries which might provide relief. In a time of rising unemployment, I can only quote what he said on that date:</PARA>
<PARA> We should try to discover the basic facts upon which our national economy is founded, and search there for the root causes of this very serious problem of unemployment. Those who examine the economic structure of our nation discover the basic economic fact that we are a debtor nation. I refer in this context not to our internal debt but to our heavy overseas commitments. </PARA>
<PARA>Those comments are as relevant in this chamber today as they were then. John McEwen recognised the real need for new industries and today the electorate of McEwen, as indeed our nation, also needs new industries. It also needs to retain those it already has. If we are to survive the 1990s and begin the next century in good shape, we must restore competitiveness in our industries and work force by improving productivity and deregulating our wages system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Spanish philosopher, Santayana, wrote that `those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them'. How vicious do the lessons have to be before we learn them? How many small communities do we have to destroy before we start to count the real costs?</PARA>
<PARA> I can say, quite unashamedly, that I love the area that I have the privilege to represent here. I will fight tooth and nail to preserve its unique characteristics and economic viability. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also continue to fight for the preservation of places like Mount Stirling and Mount Piper, to restore the soils and the forests, but to ensure that a balance is preserved and ensure that the rights of those who have worked on the land for generations are maintained. I have already moved to establish an environmental register in the electorate to provide information on land care groups, recycling, waste disposal, consumer advice and heritage listings. </PARA>
<PARA> Somehow the vision we all once had of Australia is changing. Decent, hardworking Australians are finding themselves sliding into poverty. Many of them on the fringe of metropolitan Melbourne took the responsibility for housing themselves and their families there only to find that they are disadvantaged because of an appalling lack of facilities, in particular, transport, health and child-care. I have noted the Government's program relating to these issues outlined by the Governor-General last week and I give notice to the Government that I will be pressing it on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Out in the bush things are even worse. Last Friday night ABC television demonstrated how a new poor peasant class is being created in rural Australia. People who have worked the land for many years have been hit by the twin afflictions of poor productive years and high interest rates and have been forced into poverty. But a peculiar phenomenon has emerged. Financial institutions are aware that if these people simply walked off their properties the value of the remaining assets would deteriorate rapidly, so instead the landholders are being paid a pittance to stay on not to retain ownership so that the financial institutions will lose less while the farmer loses all. The only parallel to this subsistence level existence lies in those countries where landlords hold peasants in medieval serf-like conditions. Yet this is occurring in modern rural Australia, not India or ancient China. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of the bush know that the Government has neglected them and so, too, do the members of the Australian defence forces. The Government's spending priorities have been on equipment rather than on the personnel who use that equipment. Recruitment and retention of personnel have never been more difficult to maintain. A corporal at Puckapunyal with a dependent wife and children needs social security to top up his wage in order to survive. Who can blame him for leaving and returning to civilian life when he can earn overtime and his wife has the possibility of finding employment?</PARA>
<PARA> Every one of us here must be aware that the verdict of history will not be kind if we permit this degradation of our population simply because political dogma got in the way. If Australia is again to find its balance, the talents and tenacity of these people must be harnessed and their contribution made worth while both for themselves and for the nation. Perhaps I can be only one small part of the recovery process but I aspire to bring to my job the redoubtable determination and resolution of the man after whom my electorate is named. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the many attractions the electorate of McEwen holds for me is that it is made up almost totally of small business people, either those who own them or those who work in them. Some of these businesses are in the small towns supplying the necessary goods and services to the local population while others are thriving rural concerns, such as the trout farm at Taggerty, the Rod Shop at Castlemaine, employing over 60 local people and exporting to America, Teson Trim Industries in Euroa, whose quality control standards are so high that it has competed successfully for tenders on the international market, or the grass seed export industries around Yarck and Mansfield, to name but a few. Numerous wineries, restaurants and tourist resorts all contribute not just to the local economy but to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Beddall report, the 750,000 small businesses account for half of all private sector employment and a third of all employment in Australia. They also generate around 30 per cent of the gross domestic product. In rural Australia they constitute almost all the private sector employment, especially as large concerns move business operations back to their main city bases and operate electronically and to remote places. Even State authorities are maintaining a policy of consolidation into larger rural centres, thus reducing the viability of some small towns. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative to government help which bush people have long given up hope for is self-reliance. Already I have organised a seminar for several hundred McEwen locals to promote the development of tourism in the electorate and to provide practical, cooperative ways of putting plans into effect. Within this place I will be the voice of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a vision of a country where hard work, enterprise, dedication and the willingness to sacrifice comforts for the sake of having a go are welcomed, supported and rewarded. Right now a large part of the public feels that there is no point in working hard, investing or taking risks. It seems to them that the Government deliberately penalises enterprise and hard work. At a time when this country needs increased local production, innovation and the grit to work through these difficult times people need encouragement, not barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of early settlement of our country women provided the stable base for the developing society. The author, Lucy Frost, who published a collection of letters from this early period of our history, stated:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to pay my compliments to the new member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) on her speech. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would also like to ask you to convey to the Speaker my best wishes on his re-election. This is the fourth Address-in-Reply that I have taken part in. I recall very well the first one as the member for Newcastle. The Newcastle community had just gone through a massive contraction of its work force, with some 10,000 to 15,000 jobs having been lost in the previous six to nine months. In some ways this speech today is similar to that first speech because since Parliament last sat an event of major proportions has taken place in Newcastle. I refer, of course, to the earthquake on 28 December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one had asked any Australian before 28 December whether they took out insurance for earthquakes, the answer would have been, `No, because we do not need to. They do not happen in Australia. They happen in America, China, Japan and places like that but certainly not in Australia'. On 28 December most people were checking their insurance policies to find out whether they were insured for earth quakes because, naively, no-one was aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA> When the earthquake occurred at 10.27 in the morning of that day, the cost in human life was a dozen, and officially 146 people were injured. I suspect that hundreds more were injured but not included in the official count. Also, 10,000 buildings were damaged and the insurance cost for the domestic sector, I would suggest, was closer to $1 billion than the $800m that the insurance companies suggest. In the government sector, I suspect that the State and Federal governments are facing a total cost of somewhere between $200m and $250m. So in whichever area one chooses to look, this was obviously an event of major proportions-a major catastrophe. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the House knows and recognises the effort made by hundreds of people that day-by the police, the State Emergency Service, the Salvation Army, the Army reserves, and a whole range of doctors, paramedics and various voluntary groups who assisted by caring for the injured, cleaning debris, making buildings safe and clearing streets of fallen material. It is important that their efforts are recognised. I pay great tribute to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Deputy Prime Minister, who were both able to visit Newcastle that afternoon within hours of the earthquake occurring. The fact that they visited the devastated area meant that they had a clear understanding and hence, when issues were brought to government, the responses were prompt and appropriate. It is also pertinent to recognise that the Premier of New South Wales was able to visit the area a day or two later. </PARA>
<PARA> Some five months later Newcastle is a community that is still badly damaged. The amount of construction work required is of enormous proportions and will take much longer than five months to overcome. The amount of uncertainty in people's minds is huge. The matter I wish to get to-perhaps the most important matter of all-is the decisions by the insurance companies to apply different standards to residential policies and commercial policies. In case honourable members are not aware of the distinction, I suggest they check their insurance policies-because one never knows when one might need to make a claim-for a clause called co-averaging. It relates to whether or not a property is underinsured. </PARA>
<PARA> If a property is underinsured, the insurance company has the right within the policy to repay only a proportion of the damage in the ratio of the level of the insurance. If a property is insured for half a million dollars and the insurance company suggests it should have been insured for $1 million, and damage to the extent of $400,000 occurs, the insurer will pay only 50 per cent of the cost of repair. The commercial insurance policyholder has the one per cent premium, firstly, and then the shortfall from the supposed level of underinsurance. </PARA>
<PARA> With household insurance, the insurance companies scrapped that clause completely and said, `We will accept whatever the claimant is insured up to'. But for commercial propertyowners the insurers have applied the clause and applied it with a vengeance, to such an extent that I believe it will have an enormous effect on the community's capacity to recover. There is barely a commercial building in Newcastle that is not underinsured and most of the commercial buildings are damaged to some degree. The capacity of a small building owner to meet the shortfall is of course limited, as they have been out of business for the last five months as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I call on those insurance companies to think very carefully about their image, their reputation, their standing and their credibility in terms of attracting future business, when they say to a householder, `If you are underinsured, it does not matter; we will ignore that', but say to a person who owns a commercial building, `If you are underinsured we will apply that clause to the nth degree'. The fact is that most of the commercial property owners I spoke to were being assured by their agents and their brokers that they were not underinsured before the earthquake. So the question becomes who decides what is underinsured and what the values are when an insurance broker says to a person, `This is the proper level of insurance', that person signs on the dotted line and pays his money year after year, and then along comes the insurance company after an earthquake and says, `Sorry, fellow; we took your money in good faith, but you are underinsured and we will not pay the full amount of that policy. We will only pay as much as the pro rata or co-averaging clause allows'. That in itself is a major problem. As I said, I call on the insurance companies to re-think what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a particular case which is even more brutal, where a person with a mixed residence and shop had been paying insurance premiums on the property for, I think, 15 years. The broker visits his shop at least once a week most weeks. The insurance company now insists, after 15 years of having taken his money, that it does not insure combined residences and shops, that it assumed that the property was only a residence, and that, therefore, he has misled the insurer and has acted fraudulently and, in so doing, has breached the terms of his policy and is not covered. I expect that as a result of this earthquake this Parliament will need to look very carefully at the Insurance Act in Australia, at the role of the Commissioner of Insurance and the ways in which insurance companies offer. I expect that in the Budget session I will be able to bring back some documented examples that will warrant such an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I express my appreciation to a community that has been through a great ordeal in this earthquake; a community with great pride and one which has acquitted itself as not many communities could. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Governor-General's Speech. Much of what was in it excites me and I am very supportive of it. However, I suspect that a sense of unreality is afoot in Australia where the national industry and economic agenda is being set in a most bizarre way for the most bizarre reasons. I visit factories regularly and have done so for a very long time. I have watched them invest and restructure, change their work practices and improve their performance over the last seven years from the very low days of 1982-83. The fact is that now their order books are virtually empty. Australia's heavy engineering is almost coming to a standstill. There is no question that the interest rate regime has done its work. The indicators will tell us eventually but, as we all know too well, they are at least three to six months behind. Any question about the effect of the tight monetary policy on demand can be measured very easily by going around Australia's industries. It has been effective and interest rates now need to change. </PARA>
<PARA> The more interesting aspect of the current agenda is what appears to be the trend towards micro-economic reform. I read lots of excited-almost frenzied-articles about how we have to restructure the communications industry and how we have to have a second mobile telephone system, whether it be owned by Telecom Australia or private industry. That seems to be one of the major issues. For God's sake, what does that actually mean? It means that we import about $1 billion worth of telephones and equipment, for starters. It means that we do not increase production one jot-not one bit. In other words, the effect of that particular reform on our balance of payments and our productive capacity is negative. So I question the wisdom of this so-called micro-agenda.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty we are facing at the moment, to my mind, is a relatively minor one, and one that relates not to micro-economics but to the value of the dollar. There is no question that when most of our policies were put in place over the last seven years we were projecting towards a dollar level less than it is now-certainly no more than 70c. If it reaches 75c whatever we do, as a government or country, will not matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The reductions in tariffs and the incentives for research and development to generate import competing and export potential industries all come back to the cost of our currency. There is no doubt that the currency does not currently reflect the cost of production in Australia. It is artificial and it is artificial for a few reasons, one of which, of course is again, interest rates. The second one is, I believe, speculation by overseas investment. The third is a perception that commodity prices are going to stay high or get higher. Australia is always caught in that contradiction between the cost of production and the value of our commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> If people are concerned and wish to help the Australian manufacturing sector the answer is to encourage the whole community, and the overseas community, to accept that our dollar is artificially high and will come down. I have no doubt it will come down. Whether it comes down slowly or quickly is the only question. If it were to come down quickly it would be unfortunate in terms of the instability it would generate in our trading patterns. It will come down but all the strutting, all the micro-agendas and all the other things that are being talked about mean very little by comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the possible changes in the waterfront, and all those supposed huge savings which might end up being half a billion dollars, one sees it is infinitesimal in terms of what we are talking about. For companies that have invested heavily in the last three or four years in productive capacity to see a high dollar bringing in cheap imports because of the currency value is soul destroying. I am aware of companies which went to world markets two years ago when the dollar was about 67c. By the time the trade fair finished the dollar had increased by 5c and their market went. They had great opportunities at 67c or 68c but not at 73c. Perhaps we have all tended to gloss over with trendy faddishness the national agenda being set in such bizarre ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's address referred to the science centres and, I am delighted to see, to the extension of the tax write-off for research and development. Those changes are extremely important in terms of the future of Australian manufacturing. But we are at the stage now where we need to pull together our research, our product development, Austrade and the capacity to produce products of good quality and market them well. I still believe that there is a vacuum in that field. We have good design yet we seem to have products of low quality. One only has to look at the car industry for that. The quality problems in Australian automobiles have been an enormous disappointment. It seems to happen in many of our fields of manufacturing. Australian companies can now compete, if the dollar adjusts to a more sensible level, with design and prices, but only if they maintain their quality. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that what is missing from the Governor-General's Speech is the strengthening of the quality component in Australian manufacturing and the Government's insistence on quality regimes being in place to the stage where, I believe, the Government should be saying to industry that industry will not receive any form of Government support unless it has in place adequate quality regimes which are policed on a regular basis and which are consistent. I do not believe the Australian people and the Australian Government can go on any longer supporting companies which do not make quality the hallmark of their products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's address was important and most interesting and I certainly express my agreement with many of the remarks made by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I think the next year or two will be very interesting in the Australian Parliament and certainly from the point of view of the Government. I also believe they can be very productive years and I trust that they will turn out to be so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to convey, through the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), my sympathy to all the people in his area who were so drastically affected by the earthquake. I visited Newcastle during the last two weeks on business and, as an old Novocastrian-born and brought up there-I must say I was absolutely shocked to see the gaps along the main street, Hunter Street, and, particularly, Beaumont Street where, as a very small child, I used to walk with my parents going to the pictures at night in the 1930s. Certainly Newcastle has received a devastating blow. I think those of our fellow Australians who have not visited the city do not really understand the extent of the physical damage but, even more so, the psychological damage to the people there. The people of Newcastle should feel encouraged that there are a great many people around Australia who are thinking and caring about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the brief time available to me I would like to talk about a number of issues of great importance to the future of this country. I would like to start first with small business. We have heard in the debates in this Parliament in the last few days since we first sat, and since the Governor-General's Speech, all sorts of references to whether we are in a recession, or not in a recession. One of the things that seems to have escaped people is that these days very few of us are talking about interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in the election campaign we were all hammering interest rates like crazy, and rightly so. It seems to me that small business in this country, which is the absolute backbone of employment and activity in all of our regional and provincial areas, is suffering so much from interest rates, and the Government does not seem to care. I do not say that in an aggressive fashion. I believe it happens to be the case that the Government has lost sight of small business in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to read from a letter I received recently from one manufacturing company in my electorate. It is not a massive company by Australia-wide standards but, with over 100 employees and orders on hand of $24m, it is a pretty significant employer. The letter I have received states:</PARA>
<PARA> We have received little sympathy for our problem from . . . our bank for 30-odd years, as all the banks have the jitters and are not taking any risk at all, mainly as a result of their own failure to apply more prudent measures in lending in the past. Companies such as ours, with solid business on hand, suffer as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is fair comment. I am not into bashing the banks-that is why I did not mention the name of the bank which is referred to in this letter-but it is true to say, and anybody who has been active in our community in the last year or so would know, that the banks have been shovelling money at people-they hardly had to ask and the banks have been offering it. I think what this constituent of mine has said about its being a result of the banks own failure to apply more prudent measures in the past is very sound comment. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a letter from another manufacturing constituent which again emphasises the degree of difficulty that small business is facing in this country. This particular company employs over 60 staff in manufacturing and has over $5m in import replacement. If it went broke we would be up for millions of dollars of import replacements just to replace what it produces. I quote from this letter as followed:</PARA>
<PARA> We accept that we are but one of a vast number of smallish Australian concerns-</PARA>
<PARA>five million dollar sales and 60 staff is smallish, but very significant-</PARA>
<PARA>which are being heavied by their bankers, the banks have panicked because of their exposure to mega-borrowers. With respect, government intervention seems certain to be needed to protect the vital sector of the economy represented by small industry, from the quite unwarranted effects of the bankers' present state of panic. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many honourable members and senators have received similar letters. I am willing to bet that there would hardly be a member of this chamber who has not had representations somewhat similar to those to which I have referred. I believe that in the first three months of this year some 10,000 small businesses went bankrupt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame indeed. It is absolutely appalling and it concerns me and the coalition parties very greatly. I think we should seize every opportunity to stress that high interest rates are killing small business in this country. I have with me the front page of the Port Macquarie News of Friday, 4 May. Under the headline `50 jobs go in two months-Industry crisis in Hastings'-and that is true-the first paragraph reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> High interest rates have been cited as the major cause of a severe downturn for industry in Hastings resulting in the loss of about 50 jobs in the past two months. </PARA>
<PARA>This includes a manufacturer of elevated work platforms, used on large building sites, and a boat manufacturer. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce's vice-president industrial Mr Ian Waters, said one of the main problems was the consistently increasing costs of running a business, linked with the current downturn in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the Government is totally out of touch with the costs of running a small business. Mr Waters is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Businesses are faced with not only high interest rates but a number of government taxes such as payroll tax, land tax, general council rates, electricity, fringe benefits tax, and on top of that wage increases and the advent of non-contributory superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> They find that to trade profitably under these circumstances the only alternative is to reduce costs by laying off staff. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a solution to a problem that no employer wants to take. None of us in Australia want to see increased unemployment-although the Treasurer has admitted that he expects that unemployment will grow. However, as a nation we have to face the facts and realise that the continuing high interest rates and inflation are absolutely crippling small industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to talk briefly about care of the elderly. When I spoke in the debate on the Appropriation Bills and the Supply Bills I referred to a questionnaire that I sent out to my constituents last year to which I received 1,998 responses. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Braithwaite" NAMEID="0F4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr Braithwaite</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A great questionnaire.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very useful indeed, as the honourable member says. I hasten to stress that it was not designed as a statistical survey. But with just under 2,000 responses, certainly for my purposes in better representing the people who have elected me as the honourable member for Cowper, the results are certainly very useful indeed. The question I asked in relation to the elderly was: `How can the Government better assist our elderly people?' and the top three responses were as follows. Some 678 of the respondents said `Construct more nursing homes'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some 299 respondents said `Increase the pension'. That was certainly predictable and would receive a great deal of sympathy among the elderly and aged of Australia. Some 263 respondents said `Provide more home care or home help services'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is very significant, because the Government's policy has been directed at providing policies which would keep people in their own homes, with the necessary infrastructure services. Even so, I acknowledge what the Government has done in this area and I give it some praise for that. However, the significant point is that the top response was that more nursing homes should be constructed. Perhaps the formula being used by the Department right around Australia, on average, may be acceptable. It may be designed to provide the right number of nursing home beds and hostel beds, but in my electorate of Cowper, and indeed throughout the north coast of New South Wales, because of the tremendous population growth, the formula is out of kilter. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the need for nursing home and hostel beds for the aged, we have an overwhelming need for respite care. People come to see me frequently about the need to provide in-home respite care for Alzheimer's disease sufferers, for example. One has to be on the spot to see what is actually involved in providing 24-hour care for someone suffering from this disease, perhaps a husband or a wife. It is virtually inhuman. There is a desperate need for respite accommodation so that the carers, who are saving the Government and the people of Australia an enormous amount of money, can get some much needed rest and time off. It is absolutely imperative that they should get that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have only four minutes to go, but I would like to refer to the question of the environment. I live at Coffs Harbour. My electorate covers the area from Coffs Harbour to Port Macquarie. It is one of the most beautiful areas of Australia. It is certainly an area where environmental concerns must receive a high priority. In this area we have seen people climbing trees and chaining themselves to the wheels of trucks in an attempt to direct attention to environmental issues. I think it is time that people came down out of the trees and stopped chaining themselves to trucks. All sides of our community must get together on the environment. No-one is crazy enough to want to chop down all the trees, certainly not in the National Party, even though we are constantly criticised for things that we do not do. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the National Party believe that sustainable yields and sustainable development must be the watchword for the protection of the environment and the development of Australia. It is impossible to lock up all the forests. People must be given greater encouragement and assistance to plant trees. In a speech that I made in this place yesterday, I referred to the Prime Minister's $1 billion tree planting program-which in part involved tossing 600 million seeds out of the back of an aeroplane. That is not on. </PARA>
<PARA> We need sound, sane and sensible policies so that Australians are encouraged to be positive-as opposed to what the protesters are always doing, saying, `No, stop, lock it up'. Let us open up Australia for a massive reafforestation program. Let us open up Australia so that we can imbue all our children with the vision of tree planting-because it is essential. We cannot go back. We cannot live in a situation where there are no houses. In a very basic fashion I say to those people who want to lock up the forests `What will you use for toilet paper?'-because that comes from the trees as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Our environment, our Australia, is the most precious thing we have, apart from our kids. I want to see this Parliament continually assessing the situation and working with the rest of Australia to get environmental policies which will provide for all Australians now and in the future. If we proceed to be negative and lock everything up we will simply diminish the size of the cake, referred to by an honourable member a little while ago. In Australia we need a bipartisan effort on the part of all political parties, working together to improve our economy and our environment, so that people and jobs and environmental matters can proceed harmoniously for a better future for this country and the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is with a great deal of pride that I rise to address the House in this, my maiden speech. I hope that honourable members will allow me to indulge in some nostalgia, given that my grandfather, Archibald Clyde Wanliss Fisken, was the Federal member for Ballarat between 1934 and 1937. I think it is fair to say that it is a widely held view that my grandfather's retirement from politics was the Federal Parliament's loss and Ballarat's gain. The service given to government, especially local government, by the Fisken family is, I believe, unparalleled in Victoria. It is my fervent hope that my time in this House will be remembered as affectionately as the contribution made by my grandfather to the Ballarat district.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The name Ronaldson Brothers and Tippett Engine Manufacturers is also a part of Ballarat history. There would be very few farmers, graziers or orchardists in rural Australia who have not at some stage owned a Ronaldson-Tippett stationary engine or wool press or, for a lucky few, a Ronaldson-Tippett tractor. </PARA>
<PARA> The City of Ballarat needs no introduction to honourable members as its history is an integral part of Australia's history. With the recent redistribution, however, honourable members may not be aware that Australia's premier electorate now takes in the wine growing area of Avoca, which I am sure would be of particular to some honourable members. It also takes in the major regional centres of Stawell, Creswick and Ballan as well as the well-known tourist township of Halls Gap. The boundaries of the Ballarat electorate include the electorates of Bendigo, Burke, Lalor, Corangamite, Wannon and Mallee. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may now quote from the Australian Encyclopaedia, which quite rightly states:</PARA>
<PARA> Ballarat is famous for its parks, gardens, and statutory, and for the fine examples of Victorian Architecture and iron-lacework evident in many of its buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that many of these buildings are listed by the National Trust and much of the central city is listed as a conservation area on the register of the National Estate. The pride now taken by the Ballarat community in its historical background has seen a transformation of the residential areas in recent years. I humbly urge all honourable members to take the opportunity to see the reborn Ballarat in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Ballarat is also unjustly infamous for its weather but its long list of State, national, Commonwealth and Olympic sporting champions bears testimony to the district's healthy climate. The name Ballarat itself was derived from two Aboriginal words meaning `leaning on elbow'. Until recently, Ballarat residents could not have been accused of leaning on their elbows. Unfortunately, however, there are now many forced to do so as Ballarat's profound economic decline continues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am extremely proud that the City of Stawell is now part of the Ballarat electorate. In the past 12 months I have had a great deal of contact with the Stawell community and the unqualified civic pride that is engendered locally should be praised in the highest terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I also praise in the highest terms those men and women from communities in my electorate who have formed land care groups. I am sure that honourable members in this House tonight who have similar land care groups in their electorates will share with me my congratulations which I extend to them. These men and women are the true conservationists of Australia and they are ably supported in their endeavours by the local Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers group which is also doing fabulous work in my electorate as I am sure is the case in other electorates. My electorate is also renowned for its potato, wool, beef and cropping districts which so directly contribute to the economy of the electorate and to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, to say that the Ballarat electorate truly represents the Australian community would be a gross understatement. Indeed, the attitudes of the constituents of the Ballarat electorate I believe truly represent the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people. I believe that the problems confronting the Ballarat electorate mirror the problems we face as a nation. I humbly urge honourable members to use their best endeavours to rectify these problems. The City of Ballarat presently has an unemployment rate of between 12 and 16 per cent-that is a frightening figure-and the fact that we are unable to ascertain a precise figure is a matter that I will be taking up with the relevant Minister in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great sadness to me that there is a prevailing attitude in the present Federal Government, and especially in the Victorian Labor Government, that Australia stops at the end of the Melbourne tram tracks or the Sydney bus routes. This is evidenced by the fact that the most sought after service being provided by the once vibrant-I reiterate `once vibrant'-centre of Ballarat is social security assistance. I believe that it is a matter of national shame that this situation has been allowed to occur. The significant decline in the manufacturing sector in my electorate, which has been accelerated in recent years, is the direct result of a lack of regional support policies and this question must be addressed as a matter of extreme urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, the constituents of my electorate, and I believe the Australian people overall, quite rightly expect this House to be proactive rather than reactive in addressing the problems we face as a nation. There may be members of this House who believe that the direction this country is taking is the right one but I, for one, do not accept that premise and, as such, I will be using my full endeavours to ensure that the directions taken by the Government will provide support for the genuine needy and reduce the impediments presently faced by those who wish to have a go. I believe it is sad that those who seek reward for incentive are inhibited rather than encouraged. It is of further sadness to me that the goal of wealth generation has, in some quarters, acquired obscene philosophy status. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt about my views in this regard, and I believe my Party's views. The realities are that if we wish to support the genuine needy and tackle those difficult conservation problems that lie ahead, we must have a strong economy and a government attitude that assists rather than impedes incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not my intention in a maiden speech to deliver a lecture to members of the House who are considerably more experienced than I, but there is a majority of the electors of Ballarat, albeit at this stage a slender one, who have entrusted me with their hopes and aspirations for the future and that is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. I am the father of three young children and, without wishing to be melodramatic, I assure the members of this honourable House that I have great fears for their future economic and physical welfare. I believe that the Australian people have placed implicit trust in this House to ensure that responsible environmental policies and attitudes are engendered. Inherent in that trust that has been placed in us must be a responsibility to head down the path of sustainable development. It is simply not good enough to attempt to address the environmental question in isolation and, indeed, our economic development and environmental responsibilities must be addressed together. Hotchpotch environmental policies based on confrontation can only seek to divide the Australian people and the risk of that division, I believe, places even greater responsibility on this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, with your leave and the leave of the House, I wish to address the question of the public perception of members of this House and our Senate colleagues. Without in any way wishing to detract from the amount of constituent contact more senior members of this House have, I believe it is fair to say that those of my colleagues on both sides of the House who have entered this Parliament for the first time are even more aware of the mood of the electorate. I do not believe the electorate is opposed to the major two-party system, but, rather, I believe that people are looking to the major parties for leadership and a commitment to both their personal future and that of the country. I fear that unless this commitment is made, there will continue to be those who are heavily influenced by political opportunists delivering a plethora of unrealistic promises or single-issue commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government of the day to develop a realistic and realisable policy for rural regional areas in Australia. Without the development of such a policy, and without the commitment of government, the financial drift from regional centres to the capital cities will continue unabated. Combined with this pressure on the communities of regional centres-again I am sure that members of this House from rural seats will agree-is the ever-increasing drift to regional centres by those no longer able to afford major city housing. Inherent in this community dislocation are the considerable extra strains being placed on emergency welfare providers in regional centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately this is a classic catch 22 because, as the financial resources of regional centres diminish, the community becomes incapable of providing adequate support to emergency service providers. This group has been required to meet the demands of that ever-increasing number of people who for purely financial reasons have been forced to relocate. I believe that it is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect regional communities to continue with this burden. The generosity of rural communities-and there is no-one in this House who would not agree that rural communities are generous-must have a saturation point and in times of economic difficulty that watertable tends to rise far quicker. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the electorate of Ballarat and address further matters of significance to my constituents. I have already alluded to the atrocious unemployment rate in the major centres, the significant decline in the electorate's manufacturing base and the excessive demands being placed on the community to support the outcome of government policy inactivity in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of rural Australia's greatest asset, apart from its people-its road network. Under this present Government we have seen a deplorable and significant decline in real funding for roads. The parlous state of regional and rural Victoria's local road network is to the eternal shame of those concerned. I applaud the initiatives made by my Party prior to the last election whereby a firm and achievable commitment was made to direct substantial amounts of funding back into the local road network and the road network generally. Honourable members should be aware that, following the release of a detailed report by municipalities in the Ballarat area, it is now evident that unless there is a massive infusion of funds into the local road network 20 per cent of that network will be returned to gravel within five years. It is an absolute shame. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my humble opinion that the proposal by this Government to increase road funding by way of a new tax on luxury vehicles is a proposal that treats with contempt the disastrous situation now facing the people of rural Australia. It is simply not good enough that an infusion of desperately needed road funds is dependent upon the sale or otherwise of a luxury motor vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> Two further areas of significant concern in the Ballarat electorate are in the areas of health and bush nursing hospitals and hostels. Ballarat is well served by two magnificent hospitals, the St John of God Hospital and the Ballarat Base Hospital, but there is significant pressure being applied to both those institutions. In the case of the Ballarat Base Hospital, a significant lack of funding and a deplorable lack of government concern for the health of the community have led to a waiting list estimated at between 1,100 and 1,200 people. This is a desperate situation which requires desperate measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to my election I was inundated with calls from both patients and the families of patients who were unable to enter hospital to have either major or minor surgery. When waiting lists are extended to periods in excess of 12 months at any institution, the system is obviously not working and the lives of decent people are being placed at risk. The nuns at the St John of God Hospital have recently celebrated 75 years of caring and committed service. Yet while the Ballarat Base Hospital has long waiting lists, the St John of God Hospital, which is a fine institution, is grossly underutilised. </PARA>
<PARA> The constituents of my electorate are well served by bush nursing hospitals and hostels in Stawell, Avoca and Ballan and honourable members will not need reminding of the invaluable service that these institutions provide. In many cases, it is the only vehicle that provides the opportunity for long term rural residents to remain within their area. It is absolutely imperative that funding cuts or changes in government legislation do not dislocate this group of fragile citizens from friends and loved ones. </PARA>
<PARA> The Eureka uprising is well known to honourable members, but what is perhaps not as well known is the 1990 uprising held by the small business people of Ballarat and district immediately prior to the March election. This was attended by in excess of 8,000 people-not paid people, but 8,000 citizens of Ballarat. The city virtually closed when they attended this meeting. Comments were made by some that this was an event orchestrated by either myself or my Party. That was not so. It was a result of the culmination of fears, anxiety and pressures being felt by small business. I sincerely hope that the Government does not continue to pay lip service to the plight of small business because, if this country is going to be led from the path of economic decline, I have no hesitation in saying that the recovery will be generated by its small business operators. </PARA>
<PARA> May I also take this opportunity to recognise the assistance and community support provided by local government in my electorate. These councillors are not political animals but rather are genuine and caring people who in the main remain unthanked. May I also pay credit to the former member's family for their contribution to the Ballarat community over 10 years. I also wish to thank my campaign manager, Merv Collins, for his untiring support both before and during the campaign. I also take this opportunity to thank the members of my Party and the Ballarat people for their trust and confidence. Unlike some other lucky members here tonight, my wife, Cate, and our three young children, Joanna, Claire and John, who are all under five, could not be here this evening. From the bottom of my heart I sincerely thank Cate for her support and assistance to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a plea in this House that the House respect the rights and aspirations of the Australian people. They are sick of the economicspeak with its near incomprehensible language and they simply want to hear it as it is. I am committed to representing that quiet majority, the ordinary Australian who seems to be forgotten in the chase for votes and/or re-election. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his re-election. I am sorry that he is not in the House and I ask you to pass on my congratulations. Again I thank the people of the Ballarat electorate for the honour they have bestowed upon me and my family. </PARA>

<PARA>It is no secret that this is the guillotine motion. It will, if carried by the House, go through ultimately, in its various associated motions, to provide for the passage of some 22 Bills. It is not an unusual motion to have at this time of the year but is unusual at this point of the sittings. The Opposition has made some play on this point about the extent of time we have had to discuss matters in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a greater number of sitting days in the course of this year than are currently indicated. That invariably happens in the course of the year as we move in tandem with the Senate. It is not possible at this stage to know how many more days. The fact of the matter, however, is that the Senate currently wishes to operate for a period of some four weeks straight, which is pretty reasonable, but it also requires something to operate with. These Bills and the ones we have previously considered in this place have been deemed by the Government as essential for passage for a variety of good, sound economic and policy reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why we are adopting this process of the guillotine and the reason why we have had only a couple of weeks of sitting is quite simple. We had an election at the end of March. Obviously, there would be no sittings until the end of March. Normally we would have had two or three weeks worth of sittings by the end of March. We then had two other events impose themselves on what we were doing. One was the Government getting itself into place with substantial changes in the Ministry. We did it faster than happens with governments actually changing office between political parties, but nevertheless there is a requirement there for a settling in period and for the Government to get its act together. That is invariably the case after each election. Elections that are held at the end of the year provide a period of several months before the Parliament reconvenes in February. The end of the year has in the past normally been the time when we have elections-at least until the last few. There has been a period of some months for the Government to organise itself and the new Ministers to get used to their portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally we had Easter, and invariably there is a substantial parliamentary break around Easter. We then had the events at Gallipoli, and substantial numbers of members of parliament, including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), were rightly placed there rather than here for those events. So when all those are taken together, there is ample reason why we should now have a couple of weeks of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Senate at this time is not imposing limitations on us, though practical limitations occur. If we go to the point where effectively we are sending out Bills to the Senate one week short of the conclusion of its business, then we are clearly in a position where those Bills being dealt with at that point of time are not going to receive due consideration before the break. These Bills are absolutely essential for passage this year and must get to the Senate in ample time for it to consider them. As a result of this, it will have two weeks to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the commencement of this Parliament the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and indeed the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) indicated in a bipartisan way that they wished to see the standard of this Parliament raised. The Prime Minister, in a very sanctimonious way, rose in his place, looked across the chamber and up at the galleries, including the press gallery, and indicated that he was going to do everything he possibly could during this session to raise the standards. We have had one case after another which proves that the Prime Minister has absolutely no intention of changing his ways and the procedures that the Government followed in the last Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, on behalf of the Opposition and as an indication of the sincerity of the Leader of the Opposition and his team, I want to make an offer to the Government. I hope that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will signify his endorsement of this offer. If he does I will resume my seat and we will get on with the business of the Parliament. Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I offer the Leader of the House an undertaking that the Opposition will come back here next week, and indeed the week after, if that is necessary, to ensure that legislation is properly dealt with and that the guillotine is not used. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The offer is on the basis that the guillotine is not put in place tonight. I say for the edification of new members and people who might be listening to this debate in other parts of Australia: what the Leader of the Government is doing with three procedural motions is making it necessary for this House to deal with 34 Bills between now and some time tomorrow night or, to be more correct, the very early hours of Friday. If that is an indication of what the Government means when it says it is going to lift the standards of this House, I am pleased that the Prime Minister did not say that he was going to lower the standards of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last three or four years in particular the Government has repeatedly treated the Parliament in a contemptuous way, and by treating the Parliament in a contemptuous way it has treated the public of Australia in a very contemptuous way. A document has been circulated to show clearly to members of the House the Bills that are going to be dealt with under the guillotine and the order in which they will be dealt with. As the Leader of the House has indicated, one way or the other they all have to be dealt with by Thursday at 11.30 p.m., if the document that has been circulated is accurate. But I have heard on the grapevine that we probably will be here much later than 11.30 on Thursday evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the legislation that is going to be truncated through the Parliament. First, there is the social security and veterans' affairs legislation. There is a package of sales tax Bills. Between 10 a.m. and 12.05 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 May, a period of two hours and five minutes, this chamber will deal with four superannuation Bills and the Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill. Those Bills are going to be rushed through here in two hours and five minutes. Then on the Thursday, in a period of two hours and 20 minutes, five Bills connected with the wool industry will be pushed through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that countless numbers of members on both sides of this House who will want to speak on this legislation will not get an opportunity to express their views and the views of their constituents. There is no industry in Australia that is more important to the Australian economy than the wool industry, and two hours and 20 minutes is all that is allocated to that debate. That is the maximum that will be allocated for those measures. The Leader of the House, when he was moving his resolution said, `Well, the House will sit for more days than have been indicated at this time'. If we sit for more days, it will be two or three or four days. It is not going to be two or three or four weeks in excess of what has been advised. For it to be meaningful that is what the Government should be proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has the most disgraceful record of any government in Australian history so far as the sittings of this Parliament are concerned. Only once prior to 1990 has the House sat for a shorter period than is anticipated for this year. That was in 1937, when the House met for only 29 days. On this occasion it is proposed that the House will meet for some 27 days in August and, of course, the seven days in the current sittings, making a total of 34 days for the whole of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government provides another two or three days, we might get up to, say, 40 days out of a total of 365 days in the year. It is not asking too much of the Government to meet for another week or two weeks so that we can deal with this legislation in a proper way. I indicate quite clearly to the Government that we will oppose the use of the guillotine and the timetable for the Bills that has been presented. I want to reiterate what I said right at the outset, because I want to indicate to the Minister, with all the sincerity that I can muster, that we are prepared to meet next week. No matter what commitments our members have entered into, they will clear those commitments, because their first responsibility is to the Parliament and the first responsibility of Government members is to the Parliament and to the people who elected the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, at this late stage, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude to the Parliament, to the people, and to the legislation with which this Parliament has to deal and to withdraw his motion. I indicate that, rather than truncate debate and engage in legislation by exhaustion and rather than putting through complex and important legislation with very little scrutiny, he should bring the House back next week to deal with the legislation in a businesslike way. </PARA>
<PARA> When I refer to the legislation that has to be dealt with in such a short time, I need to point out also for the benefit of people who may not be aware that some of this legislation has only just been introduced into the House. One Bill was introduced today, yet it forms part of the guillotine. The Opposition and, I would suspect, Government members, have not had an opportunity to scrutinise properly the content of that legislation. So, I indicate that we will oppose the guillotine on this occasion, as we have on previous occasions, and I appeal once more to the Minister, who does not seem to be taking too much notice of what I am saying, to withdraw the motion, and to indicate quite clearly that the House will be returning next week to deal with the legislation in a businesslike and orderly fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke before in this debate there were very few members of the Government Party in the House. For the benefit of those members I repeat what I said earlier, and that is that 1990 will go down as the second shortest sitting year since Federation. The Government proposes to sit for only 34 days this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to repeat the offer that I put to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) a few minutes ago that the Opposition is prepared to come back next week and deal with the legislation that is currently before the House, namely 34 Bills, in an orderly fashion and give proper consideration to the contents of the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> Government members are treating this debate and the motion that is before the house in a very cynical way. It has been only seven or eight days since the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) called on Mr Speaker and members on both sides of the House to lift the standard of debate and behaviour in this chamber. Yet we are here tonight to be told by the Leader of the House that in two short days the House of Representatives is expected to deal with no fewer than 34 Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that is before the House now deals with the timetable for the Bills. As I said earlier, there are some very important Bills. In one segment there are no fewer than four superannuation Bills. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Amendment Bill is allocated only two hours and five minutes. On the last day of the sitting, namely Thursday, only two hours and 20 minutes has been allocated to deal with five Bills connected with Australia's most important industry, the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What is taking place in the House now is nothing short of a disgrace. The behaviour of Government members is disgraceful. We will vote against this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to. </PARA>

I believe the Government should be censured and I believe the people of Australia will censure it when they realise that this very important social security Bill, which delivers some of the Government's promises, has been limited to less than one hour of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might say that there is no Bill that reveals the transparency of the Government's intention than this Bill and, particularly, whether the Government has a genuine concern in the area of welfare and a commitment to curtail the abuses that should have been eradicated long ago. Also, the present Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) who is responsible shows a very low level of commitment to the welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, what we have at the moment is a Minister who does not want the job and a government which for so long talked about eradicating child poverty and targeting youth homelessness throughout Australia, yet it chose to totally ignore these particular problems in the Governor-General's address last week to the Parliament. As I said, there was no mention of child poverty in the Governor-General's address yet there are over 500,000 children still living in poverty throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week my colleague the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) why there was no mention of child poverty in the Governor-General's address. The Prime Minister's long-winded and emotionally drenched reply shows how sensitive he remains over his big lie of 1987, that there will be no child living in poverty by 1990. Once again the Prime Minister attempted to hide behind semantics when defending what he did or did not promise, but the fact remains that he promised to eliminate child poverty and the Government has failed and so has the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In an unpublicised speech of just three weeks ago to the Australian Capital Territory branch of the Institute of Public Administration, Richard Farmer, who has worked for the Government in five of the last six Federal election campaigns, and in the last one worked with Labor's advertising agency, said some very pointed things about the campaign and this Government's commitment, or should I say, lack of it. Richard Farmer said:</PARA>
<PARA> By way of what, until now, were established economic beliefs, this Government had been such a failure it shouldn't have expected to win . . . So the most unpopular Government since the depression is back again. What does it do?</PARA>
<PARA> Well, if you looked at Labor's policy speech in this election, you'd find no clues as to what it will do, because that was a policy speech entirely research written. Virtually every line in the speech was a line from the party's pollster, feeding back to the people what the people had told the researchers they thought. That is the most effective way of communicating with people: telling them what they want to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some rhetoric about science centres and education in an effort to show this was a Government that hadn't totally run out of ideas. But when you actually analysed it for substance, they were very shallow and very minor promises dressed up to look like matters of great significance. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what this Bill of promises is about tonight. It implements many of the social security measures announced in the Government's February 1990 economic statement. The coalition does not oppose them because we actually proposed many of the measures in our Economic Action Plan last October. These include: tightening the administration of income support for the unemployed; encouraging labour market participation by spouses of married beneficiaries; bringing unemployment benefits and Austudy more into alignment-this has been a major problem-and removing certain anomalies in income support arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's Economic Action Plan provided for unemployment benefits for a maximum of nine months; a range of job training programs for the unemployed and disadvantaged; the waiting period for unemployment benefits to be extended from one week to two weeks for those who are involuntarily unemployed and for those leaving employment voluntarily the waiting period would be extended to up to 16 weeks, depending on the number of occasions a person had previously voluntarily left employment and received unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It provided more efficient placement of clients to ensure greater effectiveness in administration; additional opportunities for joint Department of Social Security and Department of Employment, Education and Training interviews for further assessment, and failure to attend interviews without justifiable reason to result in cancellation of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment benefits would no longer be available after nine months. Special benefits would be available, but not automatic. All annual and long service leave would have to be exhausted before unemployment or sickness benefit is paid. Administration of the invalid pension system would be improved, and sickness benefits would be reviewed monthly. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost immediately after the release of our Economic Action Plan, of which these items were a feature, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) made a pathetic attempt to dispute some of the expenditure savings estimates, and he used the Department of Finance-taxpayers' money-for the exercise. Our costings stood the test of the Treasurer's scrutiny, and we explained our costings. But this Labor Government has refused to divulge how it costed its proposals and how many people would be taken off benefits and moved into jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also deals with a number of other unrelated matters. Firstly, it ensures that the Austrian Government's restitution payments for Nazi persecution during World War II are not treated as income under the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlement Act for age pension entitlement purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption of restitution payments from the pension income test for Australian born victims of the Nazi regime is welcome and brings into line those from West Germany. For many years there was considerable confusion within offices of the Department of Social Security as to how to treat restitution and compensation payments for years of Nazi persecution in respect of pension income. The guidelines were unclear and caused considerable anxiety for those affected. We welcome the clarification in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the matter of paying at a double rate the first week's payment for victims of natural disasters, and this came about through the Newcastle earthquake relief. We welcome the Government's initiative in offering additional financial assistance to pensioners and beneficiaries who suffered as a result of that earthquake. The quick response by the previous Minister to this problem is to be commended, and while the Bill provides for similar assistance to be paid in the event of future disasters, we hope there are none. Already we have had the flood disasters of Queensland and New South Wales. The Minister should be aware that in such disasters it is very important to get an officer within the area as quickly as possible to consult with and advise those people who have been affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill implements a social security agreements with Spain. It limits the payment overseas of a wife's pension and class B widow's pension to a maximum of twelve months. It allows back payment of family allowance and family allowance supplement for multiple births, despite late lodgment of application. We welcome all these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the significant changes in the Bill relate to the overhaul of the unemployment benefit system pending its replacement from July 1991 by the Job Search allowance for the first twelve months and the Newstart allowance for the long term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his second reading speech, referred to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . far-reaching initiatives announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his February statement which involve the total overhaul of the unemployment benefit system. </PARA>
<PARA> He said at the time that there were savings to be made, which must have been in the system for years under his administration. The overhaul of the unemployment benefit system was a direct response to the Coalition's economic action plan, and the Government's copying it is praise indeed for that plan. Yet, the overhaul of the system appears to be little more than a cosmetic change, with the `new' unemployment benefit scheme being a two-tiered system-with a Newstart allowance for the first 12 months and a job search allowance after that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has talked about the Government being so successful in getting the unemployed back to work. Yet, according to the last available figures on unemployment, over 130,000 people remain on unemployment benefits for longer than one year. Does the Government consider that such figures represent a successful campaign? In addition, one of the acknowledged consequences from the present economic downturn is a blow-out in unemployment, and so that figure will rise. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that for far too long this Government did absolutely nothing to get people off long-term unemployment benefits. The Government ran a policy not for an active society but for a reactive and inactive one. It has not applied the tests necessary within the legislation to ensure a greater participation in the work force. It has only been in the past 18 months or two years that labour has given the slightest hint that it is interested in tackling the problems of long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the training program, Newstart, directed specifically at long-term unemployment beneficiaries between the aged of 21 and 54, had the coalition's full support. But Newstart proved what the Government had known or should have known for a long time but did nothing about-that a substantial number of long-term beneficiaries should not be receiving benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In early 1989, the Department of Employment, Education and Training released figures showing that out of the 10,000 long-termers who were part of the initial Newstart program, over 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the total, on the basis of either one letter of advice to attend a Departmental interview with the Department of Employment, Education and Training, or one interview, no longer required continued payment of benefit as they had found employment. It is not unreasonable to ask how many people were already employed and receiving benefits at the same time. On the basis of one letter, people suddenly advised that they had found employment-after spending years on the dole. Surely intervention must come earlier than the one year mark. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this, the Government has not learned from its inaction. The new unemployment benefit system gives no indication that for the first 12 months any serious intervention will be initiated for those on unemployment benefits. How much of an effect will the changes proposed in the Bill have on government expenditure? Following the wage/tax deal, the Government refused to divulge how it costed its proposals and how many people would be taken off benefits and moved into jobs. The nearest we got to an answer was from the Treasurer, who said on 21 January this year of the Government's proposed new unemployment benefits scheme:</PARA>
<PARA> Ours is a constructive and mature approach to help people back into the work force . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, on the following day, when asked what he would do to those people on benefits after the initial 12 month period, the Treasurer said in his inimitable compassionate style that he would `bump them off'. Again I refer to the contempt with which this Government treats its own constituency-and the fact is, of course, that it has been returned to this place with a minority of votes as compared with the Liberal and National parties, either on a straight first past the post system or on a two party preferred basis. Yet, it continues to show its contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> We still do not have any realistic idea from the Government as to just how many people will be moved off benefits under this new scheme-which will not begin until July 1990-91, 17 months after the announcement. One wonders whether the Government will ever introduce it in its original form, following the inevitable complaints from the welfare lobby. Will the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) change his mind? We all know his predilection for bowing to interest groups, particularly when in his old portfolio of those in the environmental movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that in his previous job, Senator Richardson was able to extract more money from Cabinet for environmental causes than anyone thought possible in the light economic circumstances. One of the gems of the Government's program was that it wanted to spend $1m for the eradication of the Queensland cane toad. What a great effort, and what will be done when pandering to a minority interest. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the attitude of the Minister for Social Security be now in balancing Australia's critical economic position with the claims of the welfare sector? The necessity for this balance was stated unequivocally by the former honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Clarrie Millar, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without canvassing the merits and demerits of what we do, motivated by compassion or philosophy, to relieve the discomfort and distress of the needy, I believe we are faced with the harsh reality that the more money we pour into achieving that laudable objective, the more needy the needy become and the more numerous they become. </PARA>
<PARA>So, the born again environmentalist, Senator Graham Richardson, is now reincarnated as the champion of the old, the sick, the weak, the homeless and the underprivileged-as he was the champion of the environmental movement. He will make the same determined bid to win over Grey power as he did for the support of Green power. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Richardson's attitude is very important to the future proper administration of the Department of Social Security. I think that Senator Richardson expected something better in the reshuffle. The reports that I read indicate that. Having decided that it was time to move from the environment portfolio he made no secret of his interest in an economic portfolio. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is fond of saying, the economy is the main game. Senator Richardson's supporters believed that he had earned a place in that inner circle-Transport and Communications, Finance, Industry, Technology and Commerce--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyway, it remains to be seen whether the Minister for Social Security sees a challenge in the social security area, in view of the fact that a lot of the work has been done by his predecessor in that Ministry, the Minister for Community Services (Mr Howe).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from Opposition members, people in the welfare sector itself must be wondering where Senator Richardson now stands in regard to the social security portfolio. Already the new Minister has indicated that he will review the rules regarding the payment or non-payment of benefits to dole recipients who move to an area of low employment. I should mention that Senator Peter Walsh also had some concerns in this area, and obviously about Senator Richardson's performance history in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In a speech to the Sydney Institute on 24 April, Senator Walsh implied that the social policy branch of the Government's Expenditure Review Committee was having undue influence on government policy making, to the detriment of overall economic policy. I am sure that the Government would have taken a lot of notice of former Minister Peter Walsh. If it did not do so at the time, it should be doing so now. I think that Senator Walsh is probably correct in his assumption that Senator Richardson will be pushing his own barrow, regardless of the impact on fiscal policy. Senator Richardson has indicated that invalid pensions and sickness benefits will be looked at as the need for review arises. One wonders whether he will have the courage to bite the bullet, as the coalition did in its economic action plan, in relation to what has been promoted by Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes contained in the Bill will require a substantial administrative workload. Yet, the Department of Social Security is already reeling from literally hundreds of changes that have been introduced over the past three or four years. The delivery of service is substandard-not because of the staff deficiencies but because of the complexities involved. The previous Minister refused to concede that there was a problem in this area. Will the current Minister turn a blind eye as well? In their haste to convince the electorate that all their reforms had to do with delivery of social justice, the previous Ministers ignored those who were responsible for delivering the programs-and they are the people within the Department itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Minister's ignorance about this departmental crisis was demonstrated on 30 August 1989 when, in response to a Committee report entitled `Fairness, Courtesy and Efficiency. A Report on the Quality of Service provided by the Department of Social Security'. he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . advances made by the Department of Social Security in recent years provide a sound basis on which to build even greater efficiency, effectiveness and integrity in the administration of my portfolio . . . the delivery of programs by the Department of Social Security is central to the achievement of the Government's social justice objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>So the new Minister must confront the administrative mess that was left to him by the previous Minister or else he will not be able to explain how, if the delivery of programs is so obviously failing, Labor's so-called social justice objectives can be met. Though it must be said that the social justice objectives of the previous Minister would be quite different from those of the new one, I do not believe that the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party has much time for such things. The Opposition is very interested in just how the administration of the Department will go under the new Minister. As a trial run, it delivered perhaps only less than half of what was promised in the program itself whereas our action plan would have delivered that within 12 months. I think people in the social welfare area and consumers are also interested in what will happen. </PARA>

<PARA> In keeping with that record, the Bill being debated tonight-the Social Security and Veteran's Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990-implements a number of the social security measures announced in the February economic statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). Many of these changes relate to an overhaul of the unemployment benefit system. While some will result in expenditure savings, all will contribute to an improvement in the targeting and relevance of the support provided and should, consequently, simplify administration. This ought to earn praise from the honourable member for Dawson, not disdain. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst other things, these changes include alterations to the income test which will enable beneficiary couples to earn up to $60 a fortnight extra where both partners have earnings from personal exertion. This increase acknowledges the fact that spouses are potentially labour market participants in their own right and not simply dependants of their `breadwinning partner'. As was pointed out by the Minister for Community Services and Health in his second speech in this House, the maximum free area under the income test would then be $60 a fortnight in circumstances where neither partner has income from personal exertion; $90 where only one does; and $120 where both earn income in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this initiative, beneficiary couples will be able to take advantage of labour market opportunities without heavy penalty and this should increase the incentive for them to move back into the work force in greater numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also includes adjustments which will regularise and improve the equity of rate of payment made to some beneficiaries. For instance, it is proposed that married beneficiaries under 21 years of age without dependants will receive the same rate as two single people of the same age instead of the rate which was previously paid but which was actually more appropriate for couples over the age of 21 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in passing the concerns expressed by welfare rights groups over this change on the basis that it assumes that younger people have lower costs than the rest of the community. I point out that it is an accepted practice that aged pensioner couples receive less than two single people living alone. This situation has been maintained for many years on the basis that it costs only marginally more to keep two people in a shared residence than it does to keep one as overheads are usually less when expenses are able to be split. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the main point at issue with this amendment is that in an age related income support system, which is what we have, all under 21-year-olds should receive the same level of benefit whether they are married or single. Even if there were no evidence to suggest that young people are getting married simply to qualify for a higher benefit-that is entirely the wrong reason to get married-the fact remains that the level of benefit should not be seen to influence an individual's decision to alter his or her personal living arrangements or relationships. As I understand the legislation, under 21-year-olds who are currently in receipt of the higher married rate will continue to do so-that is, they will be `saved' from the effects of the legislation by virtue of the fact that they are already in receipt of the higher benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, as a result of the provisions of this Bill, the intermediate rate of unemployment benefit-that is, that for 18- to 20-year-olds-will now distinguish between people living at home and people living away from home. The at home rate of $69.20 is in line with Austudy entitlement. These aspects of the changes are very important. Again, I note that the Welfare Rights Centre has indicated its disappointment with this change and disputes the Government's argument that this proposal `merely aligns unemployment benefit with Austudy'. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that this change produces a saving in expenditure does not remove the validity of the rationale that alignment of the age-related benefits is critical if individual choice to seek work or further education is to be made for other than financial reasons. Certainly, our society cannot afford to sustain a system where people opting for education receive less benefit than those seeking work but who are otherwise in identical circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Benefit entitlements for a married person whose spouse is on Austudy will be limited to half the normal combined married rate. Spouses' Austudy will be disregarded under the benefit income test. The number of people who would be affected by this measure is estimated to be quite small-that is, some 250 in 1990-91 and 500 in the ensuring years-and the savings amount to just over $1m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The no `saving' clause-that is, saving as an exempting clause-was included primarily because the measure includes a provision to disregard the spouse's Austudy allowance, which I have previously mentioned, in order to enhance work force incentives for the unemployed spouse. `Saved' beneficiaries would have been denied access to this change. The small number of people affected as well as the relatively high turnover of people in this situation also mitigated the value of a saving clause. It should be pointed out that people are only in these circumstances for a short time because one cannot stay on Austudy forever. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act already provides for non-payment of unemployment benefit where a person is unemployed because of a voluntary act, misconduct, et cetera. This Bill will introduce additional criteria for cessation of payment such as refusal to comply with a request to attend a Commonwealth Employment Service office or a departmental interview or to respond to correspondence. My concern with this change was that relating to the failure to respond to correspondence, given the possibility that many social security recipients may not speak English as their natural tongue or that they may be illiterate in English or in other languages. I have been assured that special efforts will be made to alert recipients to the fact that the contents of the letter are important and must not be ignored. A multilingual alert sticker on the envelope or a symbol of some kind would suffice so that the letter does not remain unopened or unread when benefits may in fact be threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> My time tonight does not permit further discussion of the content of the legislation but I am confident that my colleagues will expand on this in their contributions to this debate. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which introduces a number of reforms of the Government in relation to social security, particularly unemployment benefits. I have been a member of the Federal Parliament for some years now. As I have sat here for the last seven years witnessing the changes that the Hawke Government has made in the social security area, a very strange building in the United States has come to mind. It is called the Winchester Mystery House. It was built by the widow of the man who established the Winchester Corporation, which, of course, is a business which makes rifles. He made an enormous sum of money from these firearms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After he died and his widow inherited his enormous fortune, she became convinced that the source of this fortune boded ill for her future-that ill was going to befall her. Somehow she became convinced that the only way to defer the evil day on which she was going to pay for the ill-gotten source of the wealth she enjoyed was to keep people near her. She did this by permanently renovating and extending her home, which is now called the Winchester Mystery House. For the rest of her life she permanently had people adding to it, renovating it and extending it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not seen this particular building, but I am told that it is really a stunning building to go into. There are staircases that lead up into the ceiling. There are balconies in some rooms with no staircases down. There are all sorts of things which, if ever put together rationally and objectively and thought out well beforehand, would be put together in a quite different way. That reminds me of the Government's approach to social security, particularly in the unemployment area. </PARA>
<PARA> At least twice a year we are getting major Bills which make what are claimed to be major changes and one sees another staircase go up that ends in the ceiling. One wonders, firstly, why the staircase was not there before if it was needed and, secondly, when we look up, why we really cannot see that it is leading anywhere in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the previous Minister, I am sure, many decisions were made which were really quite genuine. The Minister had great feeling for the disadvantaged. That does not mean that I totally endorse all the things he did; not at all. Sometimes I think the feeling was a little too strong. One was continually asking the questions: what are the objectives of this social security program and what does the Government mean to happen? If we took its word we could see what the Government was saying was meant to have happened, but so one-sided was the approach to the question that many of those so-called solutions were going to lead into blind alleys. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on various pieces of social security legislation over the years. I have pointed them out in some particular cases. Here yet again we come to the problem of the unemployed, particularly what we call the entrenched unemployed, the long-term unemployed. We can all welcome the apparently employment oriented aspects of these changes. We can lament that the actual outcome is being viewed so slowly and can be measured in really quite small measures versus the amount of resources that go into it. On occasions there has been plenty of evidence that changes which have been introduced have been only cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> There is reference in this debate to the interviewing of people who are unemployed and the effect that this can have. I reiterate a comment that I have made in debate on other Bills on this matter of interviews. The Department of Social Security is so enormous that, whilst it sounds fairly simple for the Minister to decide that certain interviews are going to take place, to have that happen in an ordered and effective way is actually an enormous task to undertake. That is not to say that the people in the Department do not have the best of goodwill: it is just so big to get down to those who have to carry out those instructions the details of how they are to do it and to get to them the resources to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I instance a case that I have cited in previous debates in which conditions for another form of social security were changed and recipients-people on supporting parents' benefits and widows pensions-were to report a certain number of times for interviews throughout the years. They get a letter asking them to come in for an interview. It is an interview and counselling, as the Minister said in the letter at the time. The interview and counselling amounted to them presenting themselves at the desk with the letter, the person behind the desk taking the letter and getting out a list of people who were to present themselves, ticking their names and saying, `Thank you, we will see you in three months'. They do not even check whether they were the person whose name appeared on that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that actually interviewing people has such a dramatic effect on unemployment beneficiaries. We are told that there are drops of 20 to 25 per cent. This just shows the effects it can have when it is done properly. The terrible question imposes itself of how many people have been drinking at the public trough who should never have been there. I have known for many years-since well before I was in Parliament, which is now 16 years-that one of the orthodoxies amongst those who are this way inclined is that when unemployment benefits go up some people do not worry whether or not they have a job but they register and go through all the motions. The chances of them actually being offered a job are so low that they are right. We all hear stories of people who are paying off blocks of flats with their unemployment benefits while they are in perfectly good jobs. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free) looks at me in surprise. It is actually the truth. There are people who have the view that one is a mug if one does not do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Anything that makes sure that resources get to those who really need them is to be welcomed, not because one ought to be taking a big stick to those who need it but because there are sentiments otherwise. It becomes known that people do these sorts of things. We have all heard stories of people who are getting unemployment benefits in 10 different names and somebody who lives next door to one of them sees all these unemployment cheques arrive on the same day, all in different names. The sadness is that the genuinely unemployed suffer. Any move that is effective towards making sure that those who need the benefit get it is welcomed, but we do not see that coherence, that plan, of how we really do this. We see another staircase built on occasions. Sometimes we see a staircase that leads to one room, but to get to that room one goes up and down the same staircase. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, unemployment statistics show that the duration on unemployment benefits of what we call the long-term unemployed has consistently increased under the Hawke Government. Over the years we have had various programs to get people off unemployment benefits-a number of them make-work programs. I welcome the apparent success that some of the more recent training programs have had. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I want to very briefly address the subject of the quite disgraceful campaign that the Government waged in relation to what the Opposition had said on Skillshare in the last election campaign. We said that we would abolish Skillshare as a program and incorporate it with Jobstart. We were never saying that the objectives of Skillshare or even the techniques of those successful parts of Skillshare would be done away with. Our emphasis was always to make sure that the programs that were successful and effective were the programs that were acted on. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government was elected in 1983 it took a number of programs of the Fraser Government, abolished them all and combined them under a new heading. They were revamped programs. That is quite common. Governments do it to their own programs. That is not to say that one changes the objective of improving the chances of people getting employment. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the length of time on unemployment benefits has steadily and consistently increased under the Hawke Government, and therefore there is an ever increasing demand for Skillshare-type programs, whatever they may be called. We should always review them, be prepared maybe to abolish them but not to throw out the baby with the bath water, and to take those parts that are proven successes and use them to build on for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> My allotted time is virtually up, so I will make just a couple of quick comments in conclusion. We have the tragedy in this country today that more than 130,000 people who are job seekers remain on unemployment benefits for more than one year. Recently we had the news that the discouraged job seeker numbers, as ascertained by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, are showing once again a very substantial rise. In other words, a lot of people are giving up. The Government is not winning, and it will make real progress only when it does not make a sacred cow out of a program it has introduced, when it can be realistic and indeed ruthless in its assessment of its effectiveness, and say, `We have decided that we are going to replace that program with another one; we will take what is best out of it and we will build on that', which is what the Opposition was saying in its Economic Action Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> As the shadow Minister for social security and veterans' affairs, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), said earlier, the Opposition is not opposing this legislation. It does not reach that point because it thinks this sort of legislation should not be opposed or should not be criticised but because it really wants to see something done in this area of need. We will continue to be critical and to be prepared to say we will abolish this program if something better can be put in its place. Our concern is to have a productive Australia for the dignity, the satisfaction and the real health of our society. That grows out of the society we have always prided ourselves on in the past, that is, one where, substantially, Australians are in gainful employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) astound me with their ignorance and their audacity. They have such short memories and so little comprehension of what they are talking about. This legislation addresses social security, and I hope that every quarter or twice or three times a session there is new legislation on that subject. I hope there is even more than that: that is how it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1983, for the first time, we have had a government treating training, unemployment, employment and students as one coherent whole, trying to develop a coherent system from the ramshackle mess we inherited. This is one more step in that system. I can recall in Newcastle, early in this Government's time, when we finally developed the methodology for the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) to talk to each other. Under the Liberals they never did that. When they finally talked to each other and checked their files, guess what they found? One in five people receiving unemployment benefits was not registered for work. Those opposite have the audacity to lecture us about Winchester's house or Winchester mysteries. The gall is outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The last three or four years have been exciting in the development of a cohesive framework affecting the whole of the welfare support area, bringing together Austudy and social security payments. Under the conservatives we paid the kids more to sit on the beach than to go to university. Those things are being corrected. The Cass Review of Social Security has led to far-reaching changes of great magnitude. We are seeing now just one further step in that integration process. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) earlier referred to the need to bring the unemployment benefit levels together with Austudy. That is also part of that intellectual coherence; our systems must balance and they must fit together. At times that may cause criticism, as in this case, but the validity is more important than that criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer particularly to the natural disasters clauses that will come into operation for the first time under this legislation. I pay particular tribute to the then Minister for Social Security, and the Acting Minister, who if I remember rightly, was Senator Bolkus, for their prompt action back in December when we found a situation in Newcastle where, without notice, without warning, people were thrust out of work. In many cases both members of the family lost employment. The system provided a requirement to wait for a fortnight for any social security payments or assistance. That anomaly meant that families were left without income of any form in that quite difficult period. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certainly very supportive of these clauses and I express appreciation for the promptness of the Government in responding to the need. I would, however, bring to the attention of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) some continuing deficiencies in the current social security system in the event of natural or major disasters, and I suspect the current floods would fit this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> One instance is where one member of a family loses his or her income completely. Perhaps that person worked in a restaurant and that work is no longer available. The second member of the family, of course, has an income. The household finances are budgeted on two incomes, with a mortgage, car payments, and the cost of supporting children to match. Under our system they receive no assistance whatsoever. The person may eventually regain a job some months later, but the effect of that unemployment period can be quite catastrophic. I suggest that the Department and Minister consider providing, in a situation of that nature caused by natural disaster, some short term payment to the family, whether it be for four or six weeks-in other words, discounting or varying the qualifying income so that they have some additional help to sort out their longer term future. I have no doubt that in Newcastle young couples will be forced to sell houses and to change jobs, not because their houses were damaged but because their place of employment was destroyed. In other words, there was no longer a job for them, and in many cases any entitlements they may have had such as long service leave and holiday pay could have been lost at the same time because the owner may not have the money put aside. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of another kind of case that should be taken into account is that of a pensioner whose house was demolished. The insurance company paid out the full insured value. It so happened that that person then started to lose most of the pension. The pensioner had nowhere to live but had a block of land on which a house could be rebuilt. The pensioner was caught in a situation not of his own making where suddenly he had a fair amount of cash in the bank. That cash became a handicap to him and yet it could have been guaranteed to go towards the house, or he could at least have had time to work out what he was going to do with this block of land and the ex-house. In many of these cases the people were in their seventies and eighties. In one particular case a man's house was demolished without his knowledge. His family were apprehensive about telling him about it, and yet his income was being reduced. It gets very complicated. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that we have a clause in the Bill for natural disasters of this nature, I suggest that much more attention be paid to special situations of this kind. I presume there are similar examples out at Nyngan, Charleville and other parts of the north and west where floods have damaged property. In those cases obviously there was less insurance so I will not use that as an example, but certainly in cases where one member of the family may have lost his or her employment but the other may not, consideration should be given to their situation. Most people who lose their jobs have some warning of retrenchment, with some payment to assist them in that early period. In cases of the nature I have described there is no support and no assistance. They are caught without any cushions or buffers. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Parliamentary Secretaries at the table, I would like to convey those concerns back to the Minister and to the Department. Again, I would like to express my appreciation to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and Senator Bolkus for their timely action in January, which was much appreciated and certainly made life much more bearable for many people in Newcastle. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on sitting in the chair-a chair which your distinguished father occupied as a Speaker-and it is good to see the name Jenkins back in the Speaker's chair. I do wish to comment briefly on some of the points that have been made by the Opposition. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) referred to the number of people who are drinking at the public trough but should not be. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) adequately responded to that statement, but I feel I should comment on it also, because there are not nearly as many people who should not be drinking at the public trough as is sometimes claimed. In fact, it is very difficult to do that now, particularly in an area like Queanbeyan or Cooma, or indeed Canberra, where people have to report regularly, as they do at other Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) offices, where they have to take a job offered or they do not receive unemployment benefits. I noticed recently that some people were refused unemployment benefits in the town of Cooma because, they were told, they were quite capable of travelling to Canberra to work and it was true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that it is easier for people in some places to obtain unemployment benefits, for instance, in the coastal part of Eden-Monaro where unemployment is somewhat higher than it is in this area. Naturally, people cannot be found jobs and, therefore, it is more difficult to get people off the unemployment benefits. However, if people can get to a job that is offered, then they must take that job. It is becoming increasingly difficult. If a person moves, for instance, from an area of high employment to an area of low employment, then he is not entitled to the benefits and he is told just that. So, it is very important that we recognise the fact that a number of very stringent conditions have been put on unemployment beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, we ought to look at the record of this Government and compare it with the record of the previous Government. It is quite clear that the level of unemployment was higher under the previous Government and, therefore, it was harder to obtain unemployment benefits, simply because when it is hard to find people jobs, then it is easier for those who do not want to work to claim benefits. However, it is extremely difficult in this area in particular for people to obtain benefits unless they genuinely seek work. Only today I was told of a person who lives not very far from the Queanbeyan area and who was not given benefits. The CES felt that that person was not making himself available for full-time work simply because he described his occupation as a farmer, even though he was on a very small holding. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other points were made by two previous speakers, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Moncrieff. The honourable member for Moncrieff mentioned people using different names. I can remember that a few years ago Opposition members suggested that we ought to look at an identity card. When we suggested the Australia Card, they said they could not possibly support it unless there was a photograph. When we gave them a photograph, they then rejected it. As the social security system is computerised and as the tax file number is required, it is harder now to double up and claim more benefits. People find it much harder to abuse the system then was the care just a few years ago. We have removed benefits from many people. In my electorate of Eden-Monaro, in the past seven years, we have taken 1,000 people off benefits. </PARA>

The debate is of course gagged because this Government finds that seven days sitting in the Parliament out of seven months is enough heat for it. Given the last few days, no wonder! These Bills are part of a package of taxation Bills and propose an increase in the sales tax on so-called luxury cars from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.

<PARA> There are many aspects to the policy underlying these Bills which concern the Opposition. We will oppose this legislation.

<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to the dramatic increase in the volume and complexity of the taxation legislation which this Government has foisted upon the Australian people. Since 1985, the year of the Tax Summit-honourable members will remember that the Government had, as one of its principles, a simpler tax system-we have seen an extra 16,000 pages of tax-related material created. That, of course, includes legislation, second reading speeches, explanatory memoranda, commission rulings, court and tribunal cases and official Australian Taxation Office announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation Bills before the House tonight, including those which we are now discussing, will add another 467 pages to this already monstrous pile. If this is the result of seven years of hard Labor, I hate to think what we will get from that lot opposite in the next three years. Is it any wonder that people are exasperated by the complexity of this country's tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly ironic that these amendments to the sales tax legislation come at a time when the Government is putting great emphasis on its intention to simplify the tax laws. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has set up a committee to look at simplification. Of course that is the rhetoric; tonight we have the real action. </PARA>
<PARA> Before moving on to the main elements of this legislation I remind honourable members of Labor's true position, its true tax policy; that is, a policy for more tax. No-one should be lulled into a false sense of security by the Treasurer's claims of tax cuts. As an article in the Sunday Age of 13 May 1990 points out, they `are largely the product of money illusion'. In other words, Labor taxes by stealth. The Labor coffers-the Treasury under a Labor Government-are the beneficiaries of Labor's policies of high inflation. Since Labor has been in government we have seen an additional $22 billion of revenue to the Government as a result of bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax Bills currently before the House are designed to increase the sales tax on luxury cars. The intention to impose this increased tax was announced by the Labor Party's candidate for Blaxland in February this year. This was no carefully thought out strategy to address the crisis which is facing our nation; rather, it was an election ploy designed, as the Australian editorial of 26 April 1990 indicated, to `consolidate Labor's traditional vote'. </PARA>
<PARA> It was part of a deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions for negotiating the wage-tax deal-the disastrous accord mark VI-prior to the election. The decision to whack an extra tax on a relatively small group in the community is yet another example of Labor's quick-fix approach to the hard task of mending our economy, which is just the sort of measure which Senator Walsh has condemned so vehemently. I expect this has also driven the comments of other senior Labor Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is on a par with last year's $36m pay-off to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd and the more recent $100m bail-out of Aussat. Indeed, the revenue which the Government claims will be derived from this latest quick fix will only just cover the cost of those others I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> This is nothing but an envy tax without justification. It is put forward simply on political grounds. It ignores the very simple fact that if those who normally buy luxury cars stop buying them because of a higher tax or buy them less frequently a whole section of our retailing and service sector will suffer. While we are talking about a luxury tax, why do we not have a tax on antique clocks, surely a luxury and something of great interest to the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a classic example of legislation by press release. One of the key offenders of that practice has, of course, been the Treasurer. Indeed, in the July 1988 edition of the Australian Law News it was noted that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Law Council . . . has repeatedly urged the Government, and particularly the Treasurer-to stop using media releases to usurp the legislative role of the Parliament in a way that makes a mockery of the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not appear that the Treasurer has taken notice of this advice from the Law Council. In fact, the announcement during the election campaign of the imposition of this dramatic increase in sales tax on luxury cars is a prime example of the very practice which was the cause of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer announced, as part of the so-called economic statement issued in February 1990, that the new tax would take effect from 1 April 1990. He later changed the effective date to 1 May. Yet it is only now, in the middle of May, that the legislation is being considered by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This latest example of legislation by press release is a particularly illuminating one. It clearly indicates the Treasurer's disdain for the Parliament, especially as it involves a clear breach of the Government's own guidelines on legislation by media release set out in the Prime Min</PARA>
<PARA>ister and Cabinet legislation handbook. The handbook, which has been revised by this Government, states that:</PARA>
<PARA> The practice of announcing an intention to introduce legislation to operate with effect from the date of the announcement should be used only where there is some special justification; for example, the need to correct an abuse or deficiency in revenue laws. </PARA>
<PARA>One could hardly say that this measure-not announced by the Government but by a political party-introduced by media release and to take effect from a date which bears no relationship to the passage of the relevant legislation, has some special justification other than those purely political motives which I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The obvious implication of this practice of legislation by media release is that laws are made retrospective. This is certainly the case with the legislation we are considering tonight. The commencement date of this Bill is stated as 1 May 1990-a date plucked out of thin air by the Treasurer. I foreshadow at this point that during the committee stage we will move an amendment to omit reference to a commencement date so that the legislation-if it is passed-will more properly come into effect after the appropriate elapse of time following the royal assent; that is, 28 days after the royal assent as prescribed by the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government seeks to justify this new tax on the grounds that it will raise some $100m extra revenue in a full year. This estimate is however hotly disputed. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry and the Motor Trades Association of Australia have indicated their strong belief that, at best, the initiative will be revenue neutral due mainly to the downturn in sales which is anticipated to occur as a result of the increased tax. Indeed, information from the Motor Trades Association indicates that, as a result of the huge volume of brought forward sales, the second half of this year-when the tax is in force-will see some dealers with no sales at all in their franchise. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a presumption on the part of this Government that those in the luxury car market will pay whatever is asked for the car they want. This may be the case for some of them, but there can be no question that a downturn in sales of some magnitude can be expected as a result of this change to the law. In fact, this matter was considered by the last coalition government but it did not proceed with it for this reason. There is also no doubt that this would have the effect of reducing the level of projected revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this question of revenue, which is so closely related to the likely effects on sales employment and services in the luxury car sector of a dramatic increase in the price of goods, there is the obvious concern that this hike in sales tax is equivalent to the imposition of a new tariff on imported cars. I welcome the appearance of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who represents the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). </PARA>
<PARA> There are only two Australian made cars which fall into the category to be covered by the new 50 per cent sales tax. They are the Ford LTD and the Holden Statesman Caprice. The latter has only recently been introduced on to the market and thus there are not yet statistics on its sales. But in 1989, as an indication of the level of sales of imported cars in this country, the Ford LTD accounted for only 7.24 per cent of total luxury car sales. Thus, while the new tax will be applied to both domestically produced and imported cars, its practical effect will be to increase the tariff on imported vehicles. It will thus run directly counter to the intentions of the so-called Button car plan and the more general, stated objective of this Government to reduce protection. </PARA>
<PARA> As Stuart Simson from the Business Review Weekly said on ABC radio on 11 May, the effect of the introduction of the new level of the tax will be:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to dramatically increase the effective rate of protection and actually make quite a mockery of the Government's commitment to actually reducing protection to the Australian car industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It is particularly ironic that the Treasurer should be introducing these Bills and that we should be debating them the day after his now notorious savaging of Senator Button. Just yesterday, the Treasurer, having well and truly dumped on the third most senior member of the Cabinet, Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, in relation to his action, or inaction, on reforming the car industry, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the way to get exports up is to cut protection. The way to make the economy more supple and responsive is to remove these large constraints that have been lying around. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same tirade against Senator Button he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Now in relation to tariffs, Senator Button is on the record as saying that tariffs should be cut. But he doesn't want to cut them as much as I do. And he didn't want to cut them as much as I wanted them cut and had them cut in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the same bloke who is now adding a huge 20 per cent in sales tax to the price of what are overwhelmingly imported vehicles. I have yet to hear -and would like to hear-the Treasurer try to reconcile his own rhetoric with his action to bring in even greater protection in the car industry-this being the classic case of the pot calling the kettle black. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the Treasurer's astounding hypocrisy on the matter of tariffs and protection from the Australian car manufacturer's viewpoint, there is also a foreign policy matter to be considered. The Motor Trades Association quite correctly points out that, as a large number of luxury cars are imported from Europe, the proposed additional impost, levied as a de facto tariff on imports, could jeopardise Australia's policy aspirations in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Indeed, the imposition of this tax could well make Australia the laughing stock of those negotiations. My colleague the honourable member for Mayo, an acknowledged expert on trade issues, will speak at greater length on this issue later in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the limited time opportunities provided to the Opposition to outline the case against this very poorly considered tax proposal, let me simply reiterate the main points of our opposition to this package of tax Bills. There is a lack of sound economic rationale for introducing this new tax. It is simply a political manoeuvre which will have no ultimate benefits for the Australian economy. The nature of the introduction of the changes to the law-legislation by press release-is wrong as a matter of principle. The Government, in our view, stands condemned for pulling this stunt. We are opposed to the retrospective nature of this proposal. It is wrong again in principle. We have had the absurd proposition of people being told that they had to collect a tax when the laws were such that they would be breaching the law to be collecting the very tax that the Treasurer wanted collected. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a concern that the new level of tax may not raise anywhere near the amount of revenue claimed by the Government. That is just a matter of common sense. I am surprised that senior members of the Government fail to see the point. We are concerned about the prospects of increasing unemployment, just at a time when this Government's policy is to bring on a recession and increase unemployment as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned that this proposal is in effect a de facto tariff on imported vehicles, in direct contravention of the Button car plan, and exhibits the hypocrisy of this Treasurer to call for reductions in the level of protection and at the same time to be introducing increases in protection. Lastly, a point to be made more firmly by the honourable member for Mayo, the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations, is the fact that this new tax may impinge on the GATT negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> So for those very substantial reasons the Opposition will oppose this measure. We will oppose it here and we will oppose it in the Senate. We believe that the Government ought to reconsider this proposal. It is ill considered and in due course will be seen to be such. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), appropriately referred to the tax summit at which the consumption tax was rejected. The Government took that into account and took a range of other quite appropriate taxation measures. We need to remember that the people who rejected the consumption tax are in some cases supporting the concept today. The Government set in train a series of measures based on a very exhaustive tax summit. They included the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, measures against the bottom of the harbour schemes and a whole range of schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We could not wait five, six or seven years for the Opposition and for other groups in the community to decide that they wanted a consumption tax. We needed to move then. There were plenty of rorts and abuses of the taxation system which we needed to get at then. So we have had a series of measures over the years. They include the measure that we have tonight, the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As with a lot of other measures that have been taken by the Government, the Bill takes away the need for a consumption tax. We need to look at whether we should go for a sales tax on luxury cars or the consumption tax that the Opposition has suggested. A consumption tax would help only people who are like me, perhaps, people who have most of what they want in wordly possessions, people who do not need to buy many things, particularly big ticket items, and who therefore are not particularly hurt by a consumption tax. In fact, if it will reduce their income tax then it is a help to people who are fairly well established, who are relatively well off, who have paid off their homes and who have the things that they want. </PARA>
<PARA> It certainly would not help young families, people who are just starting to pay off their homes, people who have mortgages, people who have to buy furniture, household appliances and that sort of thing. They would be paying dearly through the consumption tax. This type of measure, a sales tax on luxury cars, is much fairer. </PARA>
<PARA> A consumption tax would certainly not help the fixed income retired people, people who receive their incomes from interest or fixed superannuation, who do not have adjustments to that interest or to that fixed superannuation. What help for them with the higher prices that would result from a consumption tax? Pensioners and other social security beneficiaries, who are supposed to be going to have their incomes indexed by the Opposition, would be hurt by a consumption tax because in the end the adjustments would almost inevitably be forgone, particularly under a coalition government. The record of coalition governments shows that they do not always make pension adjustments when they are due. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are low income farmers and low income business people, the people who may have been hurt by the recent floods or by the earthquakes in Newcastle. These people are on low incomes yet they have to buy enough to live on. They have to buy things to replace the damaged items. They would pay dearly in consumption taxes even though under the present system their income tax would be relatively low. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we think of the businesses, the people who would be collecting the consumption tax. If it is like it was in Victoria, where there was a turnover tax for a short time, business people will be submitting monthly returns and having an adjustment made at the end of the year. It would be a nuisance for every business to pay a separate tax to the Federal Government as well as to the State Government. So we certainly do not support a consumption tax. We prefer the sort of strategy that has been developed through this Bill, a sales tax on luxury cars, so that the people who can afford to pay the tax pay it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak in the House tonight on this package of Bills. We are debating the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1990 and the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bill 1990. The package was first announced by the Government on 21 February 1990 in the economic statement that was handed down that day. It gives effect to the decision to increase the rate of sales tax on so-called luxury motor vehicles from 30 to 50 per cent. Luxury vehicles are cars, station wagons and some four-wheel drive vehicles with wholesale prices above $28,793.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This particular amount is the wholesale equivalent of the upper limit of $42,910 on which depreciation is allowable for income tax purposes on such vehicles. Each 1 July this amount is altered in accordance with indexation changes that have occurred. There has been some discussion in this debate, I think-and I am indebted to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for raising the issue-about the appropriateness of the tax mix. In Question Time today, and subsequently from the Treasurer (Mr Keating), we heard some-in my view-very elucidatory statements about how and why the Government has been involved in bringing about a massive change in the tax mix in this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been, of course, to broaden the tax base. No longer are we dependent purely and simply upon very high marginal tax rates, which of course were around for many years under conservative governments. We have broadened that particular tax base and what we have done is to simplify the system. We have not only simplified it; we have made it much fairer and far more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> In this package of Bills we will remove luxury motor vehicles from the second schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. They were goods, of course, that were taxed at the 30 per cent rate. We will add a new sixth schedule, which will cover luxury motor vehicles, to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act-and of course that raises the rate to 50 per cent-and we will exclude from the luxury vehicles category motor vehicles specifically fitted out for transporting disabled persons whilst seated in wheelchairs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in respect of that last matter that I would like to commend the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), because too often when certain decisions are taken by government in regard to taxation matters, special interest groups within the community are forgotten. In this case that has not happened and the Government-being the compassionate Government that it is-is again looking at exempting those particular vehicles fitted to carry wheelchairs. I am sure there are many other members of this Parliament as well as me who know of people and have probably dealt with people who have come to see them and not only requested exemption from sales taxes and so on, but also have been looking at ways in which governments may be able to assist them in acquiring vehicles of this nature. I am very pleased to say that, whilst there is still a sales tax rate, it is going to be lowered to 20 per cent from 30 per cent. Perhaps at some future time, when economic circumstances permit, the Government might be prepared to look at removing that altogether, because we are talking about a very discrete and very important part of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The application of these Bills will take effect as of 1 May 1990, subject of course to the legislation being passed in this House and in the Senate, and there is a financial impact associated with the passage of this legislation. It is estimated that the increase in the rate of tax applicable to luxury vehicles will produce a net revenue gain of something like $105m in a full year. Though there may be some members on the other side of the chamber who have an interest in ensuring that sales taxes associated with Ferraris or BMWs are not altered, particularly in an upward direction, there are those on this side of the House who believe that progressivity in the tax system, whether it be through a sales tax of this nature or whether it simply be the normal course of events with marginal tax rates, should still apply. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer so ably demonstrated in his contributions in the last two days, there is some confusion on the part of the Leader of the Opposition in particular, but the Opposition parties generally, as to whether or not they stand these days for some degree of progressivity in the tax system or whether or not they can take the hairy-chested approach of offering as a policy tax cuts for middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second issue-and I come back to the question of motor vehicles specifically fitted out for transporting disabled persons seated in wheelchairs-there will be a cost to revenue estimated at about $3m in a full year. Again, for the people that we are looking after in regard to that concession, I do not believe that the figure of $3m is a difficult figure to live with. In fact, those people who are confined to wheelchairs and must therefore have specially fitted out vehicles can in fact be to some extent, I guess, subsidised by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that these Bills continue to allow the Government to broaden the tax base, to continue to maintain a degree of progressivity in the tax system. The change is again directed at fairness and equity and at ensuring that those with the capacity to pay-people who are purchasing or leasing vehicles in the range that are classified as the most expensive vehicles in this country-are made to contribute a reasonable share. I might also say that the additional tax may do something in the long term for our balance of payments and our terms of trade. If, as is generally the case with most of these expensive vehicles, they are imported, we may see a trend of people returning to Australian produced cars. If enough sense is made of this and if people take enough notice of the legislation that is before us, notwithstanding the cries from some of the motor vehicle dealers at the present moment as to the effect that this will have on their business, I believe that we will see some changes-hopefully, some significant ones-in terms of the balance of payments problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bills and the legislation to the House and in doing so would commend both the Minister for Science and Technology and the Treasurer for continuing to ensure that the tax system is made fairer and more reasonable and that those with the capacity to pay, who perhaps in the past have not really contributed their fair share, will do so now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When proposals for a luxury tax were being bandied about last year by members of the Government, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the Treasurer (Mr Keating) came out and said that any such tax would be `mere embroidery on the fabric of policy'. The Treasurer then, if not now, recognised that a luxury tax was no solution to our current account deficit. It was and is to be a simple-albeit unwelcome-piece of policy decoration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The election changed that stated position of the Treasurer, however. During the election the Government turned this `embroidery on the fabric of policy' into part of its election platform, announcing the sales tax measures on luxury cars that are now before the chamber. The purpose of the mid-campaign announcement is plain for all to see. The Government was seeking and is seeking now to appeal to the envy that motivates a minority of our community. This envious minority is particularly prominent amongst supporters of our opponents in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were designed to shore up the Labor Party's support during the election campaign among Labor's traditional constituency. More importantly, the great levellers in the ACTU leadership made the introduction of this tax a precondition of their acceptance of the accord mark 6. Yet again we are faced with legislation from the Government that has been dictated by trade union bosses. The sales tax on luxury cars has thus become a major plank in Government policy. Bereft of solutions to this country's economic problems, the Hawke-Keating Government stoops to the politics of envy. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation increases the sales tax on cars valued at over $28,793 from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. That is an increase of a massive 67 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial impact statement accompanying this legislation claims that the legislation, in effect, will result in a net revenue gain of some $105m in a full year. How this figure is calculated we are not told. Based on existing sales figures the tax will only raise an extra $53m. On the basis of some industry estimates, however, lost sales and import duties could result in a revenue shortfall of nearly $200m as a result of the imposition of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The understanding of the Motor Trades Association and others is that this tax will be entirely self-defeating in terms of its value to the revenue. The industry is already experiencing falling sales and anticipates a massive fall in sales of so-called luxury vehicles as a result of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a sharp increase in luxury car sales following the announcement of the tax of which, I am sure, we are all aware. March sales normally run at 820 units but this March they were running at 2,290 units, suggesting-and that is putting it mildly-that most intending buyers of luxury vehicles for the immediate future have escaped the tax. Not only must we take account of the losses in sales tax under this legislation, but also we must take account of the almost certain losses in income tax as a result of the downturn in the industry which will be one of the effects of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic impact of this tax will be entirely negative. Australia produces two luxury vehicles, under the definition used in this Bill, the production and sale of which will be adversely affected by this tax, as will the luxury car hire industry. The result, inevitably, will be less economic activity. We must also remember that registration, insurance, lease repayments and fringe benefits tax liability are all based on the retail prices of motor vehicles. When one adds to this the economic losses that result from the administrative burden of yet more sales tax measures, then we are looking at a tax which will result in a net loss to community wealth. But, of course, that would not be unusual under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax adds up to further protection for the Australian car industry. The Government prides itself-and we heard the Treasurer dissembling today, and we have heard what Senator Button has had to say about it in recent times-on its reductions in tariffs on imported vehicles. It goes into international negotiations, such as the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round of talks, calling for similar reductions in tariffs on the part of other countries. Yet here we have the Government increasing non-tariff barriers to the import of so-called luxury cars from a tariff equivalent of 40 per cent to 75 per cent under this legislation. That is the equivalent of a 75 per cent tariff barrier under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public is already being ripped off in the market for motor vehicles. A new family car built in Australia today costs around $23,000. It will not be long before that increases, under the inflationary policies of the present Government, into the luxury car range. For many families, owning such a car is, indeed, a luxury-never mind the affordability of so-called luxury cars which are dealt with in this legislation. It will continue to be a luxury so long as the Australian car industry is free from the sort of international competition that luxury car imports, at least in part, represent. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement and introduction of this legislation on the part of the Government provides yet another example of legislation by press release. The introduction of this tax has been back dated to 1 May of this year. In the meantime luxury car dealers have been put in the situation of having to collect this tax without the benefit of having seen the legislation. It has happened again. It has happened many times before and it continues, despite the protestations of industry and of many in the legal and accounting professions. </PARA>
<PARA> More seriously still, where this tax has been collected after 1 May and before this legislation is passed-and we are presuming it will be passed-luxury car dealers will have been breaking the law. The existing law provides for the sales tax on these vehicles to be levied at the rate of 30 per cent and not 50 per cent. However, under this Government it is quite acceptable to force people to break the law for the sake of revenue. To this end the Treasurer issued a press release on 24 April which, in effect, constitutes immunity from prosecution for those who levy the tax at the new rate. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office will not seek to penalise dealers who make provisions for, or remit, additional sales tax in anticipation of legislation being passed. </PARA>
<PARA>David Solomon, in the Australian, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It's all right to break that particular law if the Government is going to get the money. </PARA>
<PARA>That is about the size of it. One can break the law as long as the revenue benefits. So often we see that in both the legislation governing tax laws of various kinds, and in the administration of those tax laws by the Commissioner and officers of the Australian Taxation Office. I have dwelt on that at length on previous occasions and I have no doubt I will again. That is the extent of the Treasurer's respect for the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the Treasurer has held this Parliament in contempt. He assumes that the Parliament will rubber-stamp his legislation so that he can bring tax measures into effect whenever it takes his fancy-in this case, on the campaign trail. Needless to say, there is not one word about the retrospectivity of these Bills contained in the legislation or any remarks made about it by Government members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills, and the accompanying documentation, are completely silent on the question of how this legislation was supposed to operate, and wholesalers were supposed to collect sales tax when the enabling legislation did not exist. The explanatory memorandum states that the remittance of these illegally collected moneys can be made 27 days after these Bills receive the royal assent. But, as David Solomon has again noted, there is no legislative backing for the administrative arrangements that might be entailed in meeting these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to ask the question: What does this legislation achieve? It will not raise revenue for the Government, assuming for the moment that an ever-greater tax grab by the Treasurer was, in some way, a good thing. It will do nothing to improve our current account deficit, with luxury car imports counting for less than one-half of one per cent of total imports. Even if this tax did lower the deficit, this would be no substitute for enhanced export performance. The Government is obsessed with addressing the current account deficit through crude efforts at demand management and the suppression of economic growth. These efforts are failing and this legislation will be one more failed effort on the part of the Government. This legislation achieves only the Government's desire to play the politics of envy. It is no substitute for sound economic management and for the responsible use of the taxation system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill and the Sales Tax (Nos 1 to 9) Amendment Bills provide for an increase in the sales tax on luxury vehicles, so-called, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent-an increase of 20 percentage points. As my colleagues have argued, there is little justification for this measure. It saw the light of day during the election campaign. It was an election ploy, classed as a populist tax, associated with luxury cars-an envy tax if ever there was one-and part of the Labor Party's package to finance its various election promises, specifically in this case concerning roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A luxury car is defined by the wholesale value of the vehicle, namely, if the wholesale price exceeds $28,793, which translates to a retail value, without the impost, of $42,910. There are only two Australian made vehicles in this market, the Ford LTD and the recently released Holden Caprice. As has been made clear, the Opposition opposes the measures on several grounds. The first is that, as this sector of the market is largely the preserve of the imported upmarket vehicles, the imposition of this additional sales tax will have a protective effect. That goes against the broad consensus across the political spectrum in Australia today-and of course we have the Keating/Button stoush in the news right now-in favour of reduced protection. It may even impinge on the current General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it adds yet another variable component to the sales tax rate structure which, as we all know, is all over the place and results in significant distortions in demand and production patterns. In general terms, the distortions in the present sales tax arrangements provide a strong argument against the existing wholesale sales tax, and it is crying out for reform. Thirdly, there is the likely impact of this measure on sales, especially with the current slide into recession, with a consequent adverse effect on employment and business prospects in the sector. </PARA>
<PARA> As a revenue raiser, the Government's estimate of $105m in a full year looks extremely optimistic. Indeed, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has estimated that, at best, the charges may tend to be revenue neutral. But still the Government perseveres, and here we have these Bills. The truth is that the sales tax has been a great favourite of the Hawke-Keating Government for raising revenue. Indeed, it has become, as Tony Thomas wrote a little while back in the Business Review Weekly, `the sneakiest weapon in Treasurer Paul Keating's arsenal'. </PARA>
<PARA> One can consider the following figures. Under this Government, the highest taxing government in Australia's post-war history, the total of revenue has gone up from $48.4 billion in 1982-83 to $95.9 billion, as estimated for 1989-90. That is an overall increase of 114 per cent over that period, in which the rise in the consumer price index will be in the vicinity of 85 per cent. However, over the same period the revenue from the wholesale sales tax has increased by 200 per cent. Much of that increase has occurred since 1985 when the Treasurer sought to implement a broad-based consumption tax-but finally rejected it. Yet, with the vast range of the sales taxes and other indirect taxes, and this great 200 per cent increase, what is clear is that Australia is already subject to a de facto consumption tax, which has been built up, as Mr Thomas said, by stealth. That shows the contempt of this Government for the average Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> If, in fact, the broad-based consumption tax had been implemented back in 1985 it would have been done with adequate compensation for people on low or fixed incomes and those receiving welfare benefits. That point needs to be fully appreciated in the current context of a renewed consideration by the coalition of such tax and in the light of the comments made earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). </PARA>
<PARA> My view is that the case for such a broad-based consumption tax is a very strong one. I stress that this is not a matter of an additional tax. The review of the tax proposed by the coalition is strictly on the basis that a consumption tax should not lead to an overall increase in the burden of taxation in Australia; rather, the aim is to ultimately reduce overall taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax which is the subject of debate tonight, with all its distortions, as between the goods subject to the tax and as between the goods sector and the services sector, would be abolished in the context of the introduction of such a broad-based tax. It would also have the additional benefit of eliminating a tax on exports, and indeed it would open the way to an internationally acceptable export incentive. In addition to the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, there would be a substantial cut in income tax. Indeed, the achievement of that, with its resultant benefits to incentive and increased productivity, is the major objective of the exercise. It is worth noting that many of those who avoid paying income tax at the moment, the racketeers, the spivs, are caught in the act of spending. So, such a broad-based consumption tax is an important factor in combating that sort of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal object is to increase incentive and productivity, and to encourage national saving. That is the primary thrust of a broad-based consumption tax. In conclusion, I would say that such a consumption tax is not to be seen as a panacea, as the ultimate solution to all our vast balance of payments deficit and frightening overseas debt problems. Rather, a consumption tax, replacing this distorting wholesale sales tax, is one of a whole array of measures, changes, reforms and structural adjustments which, when taken together, add up to the major reform in structure and attitudes that is needed, nay is imperative and urgent, if Australia is ever to become a thriving, competitive international western market economy and a real force in the Asian-Pacific region in the 90s and into the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The luxury tax proposed by the Government clearly discriminates against a section of the community quite unfairly. One of the groups involved are those people who use four-wheel drive vehicles as part of their business or out of necessity due to the region in which they live. I refer to the people who live in many parts of regional Australia, and tonight I refer particularly to people in the horticultural industries who use these vehicles as part of their business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The recently released Toyota range has seven models. Details were released only this week and between now and August the whole model range will be on sale. Toyota will have seven vehicles affected by this luxury tax. Vehicles in the Nissan range will be affected by this luxury tax and, of course, the entire Range Rover range will be affected by it. An interesting point is that these vehicles do not have Australian-made counterparts. They are all imported, because vehicles of this type are not made here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite the instance of families which have more than three children. Such families need an eight-seater vehicle. However, such vehicles have ended up in the luxury tax bracket. So there is a clear discrimination against those families which have more than three children. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in my speech I referred to the horticulture industry. Many people involved in this industry use four-wheel drive vehicles not only for their own personal purposes but also to transport employees to their workplace. So four-wheel drive vehicles are used as part of their normal business operations. The horticulture industry employs a great number of seasonal workers. In the fruit industry, for example, in many cases workers are picked up in town at the local Commonwealth Employment Service office and taken to the workplace. However, government regulations specify that such people cannot be carried in an open vehicle. So, people in the horticulture industry not only use four-wheel drive vehicles for private purposes but also use them to transport workers from town to the place of work. Yet, these work vehicles are being lumped in the category covered by the luxury tax. But they are not a luxury vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason I oppose the application of this tax to four-wheel drive vehicles is that in many cases such vehicles are also used to carry agricultural chemicals from town out to the place of business. Once again, government regulations provide that these chemicals must be locked up in a vehicle. They cannot be left on the back of an open truck while the owner is carrying out business in the town. Surely this is a situation where the four-wheel drive is not a luxury vehicle but in fact is a work vehicle which is used in the normal course of business operations. This is particularly so in the horticulture industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases, four-wheel drive vehicles double as prime movers. They can tow a trailer and cart produce to market. As I have said, in many cases the four-wheel drive can be used to bring workers from the town out to work on a property. In these circumstances the four-wheel drive is a work vehicle, not a luxury vehicle. Yet, as I have said, it has been lumped quite unfairly with other vehicles under this tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Four-wheel drive vehicles that are used in the remote areas of Australia are a necessity and not a luxury as the tax implies. They are used to travel over rough roads to enable people to reach town, often in times of emergency. I might point out that this is the only type of vehicle that can transport to town people who live in the parts of western Queensland, western New South Wales and Victoria which have been devastated by flood over the past three or four weeks. Once again, I point out that these vehicles are used as work vehicles which can double as prime movers. Many people attach a trailer to the back of their four-wheel drives in order to bring home necessary supplies. Often they travel 100, 200 and 300 kilometres from their nearest town. So, as I have said, four-wheel drive vehicles are used as part of business operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases four-wheeled drive vehicles are used in the remote areas of Australia to take children to and from school. If four-wheel drive vehicles were not used, children would often not be able to reach school in the wet season. I might just add that right now we are in that season and if four-wheel drive vehicles were not used many children would not be able to get to school. </PARA>
<PARA> The state of our roads over much of inland Australia demand that one must have a four-wheel drive vehicle if one wants to get anywhere at all. Right now it is difficult to travel on certain roads in Queensland. I do not have to repeat the situation in Queensland with respect to roads as a result of the devastation caused by the floods. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out, these vehicles are not luxury items. They are a necessity for many people in business and purely family situations. Four-wheel drive vehicles have been unfairly lumped with luxury motor vehicles in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about the sales tax on luxury cars in my capacity as the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations. Honourable members may be surprised that in that capacity this would be an issue that would particularly concern me. Let me say that I endorse the comments that others on this side of the House have made in relation to this iniquitous measure. But, it does have a very direct effect on Australia's credibility in the current multilateral trade negotiations-the so-called Uruguay Round. This tax which is being imposed on luxury cars is really a de facto tariff imposed by the Federal Government. The tax affects less than 8 per cent of locally manufactured cars. Indeed, 92 per cent of the cars affected by this tax measure are imported into Australia mainly, as honourable members will be well aware, from Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth considering this: under the Button car plan, which has come under a bit of scrutiny of late, imported car tariffs have dropped from 57.5 per cent in 1984 to 40 per cent. I know that is not enough and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) does not think it is enough either. But the interesting thing about this measure is that although the Treasurer does not think a reduction to 40 per cent is enough for the local car industry, the effect of this new tax is to increase to 74 per cent the effective tariff rate on imported cars sold at above $42,910. This is the Treasurer who has gone out and publicly complained at a press conference that Senator Button has not reduced tariffs enough on the car industry and, at the same time, with a sweep of his hand during an election campaign, has introduced an effective 74 per cent tariff on cars valued at nearly $43,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting for honourable members to learn tonight that some countries have noticed this. Needless to say, the Europeans have done so. The European Community has made representations to both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, and, I believe, the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), pointing out this very fact, that during the multilateral trade negotiations when Australia is grandly going around arguing for the liberalisation of trade, a position that the coalition has supported throughout the period of this Government, the very same Government is increasing the effective rate of protection on certain categories of cars in Australia to 74 per cent. The European Community has made this point to the Australian Government and I understand that the response of Senator Evans to this complaint was simply to shrug his shoulders. As the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is sitting at the table, knows only too well, he did so because this is part of a trade-off with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which apparently demanded this particular iniquitous and incomprehensible measure. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the irrational economics which everyone in this House is really aware of in the case of this measure, the problem is that although it is not a really major issue in the context of Australia's position in the Uruguay Round, as a minor issue it undermines the credibility of our case. We need to argue for the liberalisation of multilateral trade. That is fundamental to the evolution of Australia's agricultural industries and services industries. But if on the one hand we are arguing that and on the other we are arguing that we should be stinging imported European cars at a rate of 74 per cent, frankly I do not think our position stacks up too well. Therefore, in my view and in the view of the European Community this is a matter of great embarrassment to the Australian Government. It is an embarrassment to our position in respect of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also highly questionable whether this measure is likely to do anything constructive for Australian industry. I would have thought that nobody would know better than John Bagshaw, the outgoing Managing Director of General Motors-Holden's Ltd. I think what he has had to say is worth considering; I think he summed up the position pretty well. He said of this measure:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is absolutely scandalous from an industry perspective . . . It doesn't affect us very much-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, Holden's-</PARA>
<PARA>and it could actually be of some benefit to us . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But he has a bigger perspective than the Labor Government, because he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but I think if you are trying to guide an industry out of the dark ages into international competitiveness, it is absolutely the wrong way to go. This is the wrong sort of image we want in the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>He thought it made Australia look like cowboys. `We must look like cowboys', said John Bagshaw. I think everybody would agree with the very distinguished leader of the automotive industry in Australia, as well as overseas. In addition to the remarks made by the European Community to Australia, his comments are a significant humiliation of the Government's very cynical position on this whole issue of luxury cars. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more, this particular measure has the potential to destroy that small market niche that the Australian luxury car industry already has-the LTD and the Holden Caprice. The Holden has recently come on to the market. The company is trying to promote these vehicles. I have seen advertisements on television promoting these vehicles. But the Government suddenly decided that it wanted to increase the sales tax on them by 50 per cent. It does not make any sense at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make about this iniquitous measure is that the Treasurer said in his speech to the National Press Club last week, the speech that should have been made in the Parliament, that the Government wanted to review the operation of sales tax in Australia and to make sales tax more rational. I would have thought, given the limited view that the Government has of reform of sales taxes in Australia, that one of the things it would be looking at and, I know, is looking at is ensuring that we have one rate of sales tax, minimising the divergence between the low and high rates of sales tax. As everybody in this House knows, if we have different rates of sales tax we effectively have a government saying to consumers, `We have a preference for you to be consuming things with the low levels of sales tax and a preference for you not to consume things which attract a high level of sales tax'. This is not a decision politicians should make. Consumers should make those decisions on the basis of a level playing field. The Treasurer is conceding that point and conceded that point in his speech to the National Press Club. At the same time we have him introducing legislation into this House to create a fourth level of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes I have had available to me I would have to conclude by saying that this is one of the most irrational, inconsistent and incoherent pieces of legislation that the Government has brought before the Parliament since 1983. It will not be remarked on as one of the most important, but it is certainly one of the most irrational and one of the most cynical. It is a piece of legislation that doubtless has some political appeal because most Australians-least of all, members of parliament-cannot afford cars worth more than $43,000. But the fact is that it appeals to notions of envy, and all of that, in the community. It encourages those feelings and I suppose the Government thinks that that is good politics and it is somehow clever. It is irrational in an economic sense and it is damaging of Australia's position in these vastly important multilateral trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of the Government, not just the Minister for Trade Negotiations and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade-the whole of the Government-need to realise that success in the Uruguay Round for Australia is fundamental to the evolution of our economy. We must succeed in making some progress in the Uruguay Round through the Cairns Group, through our own lobbying and through the general evolution of those negotiations. If we are to go around doing silly things like this, introducing an effective tariff rate of 74 per cent on imported luxury cars from Europe, we are not going to get very far. We are just going to be seen as cynical hypocrites. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-There are just a few points I want to respond to in relation to issues that have been raised, mostly from the other side of the House. The first relates to the nonsense assertion that this proposition was a precondition to the signing by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) of the accord-mark 6 as it has been referred to-prior to the last election. I refute that. I suggest quite categorically that I ought to be in a better position to speak on this than any of those people who have spoken in this debate on this point. At the time I was the President of the ACTU and I categorically refute that this proposition was a precondition to the accord measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second issue relating to revenue is an important issue. I will come to the suggestion that this infringes on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) because that may on the face of it appear to be an important issue also. But it is important to address the revenue measure because, after all, this tax was introduced to raise revenue. If it is not going to raise that revenue, it hardly seems worth pursuing the exercise. I was conscious of this aspect because a number of representations were made to me in my electorate from distributors of automobiles who will be affected by this tax. As a consequence of those representations I arranged discussions between the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and members of the Government to really give the opportunity for their assumption that this will not raise revenue to be put to the test. The automobile distributors had that opportunity but, as a result of those discussions, they were not able to convince the Government that the Government's assumptions at arriving at the revenue yield from this measure would not be met. I make the point that, whilst there may be a point associated with it, it is a point that has been found wanting but has been unable to be put to the test. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is the assertion just made forcefully by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) about the concerns with GATT. I must say that I had the opportunity to read the honourable member for Mayo's press release on this issue, which said that he had spoken in the debate-which had not taken place when this press release was issued. I just want to make a fairly simple point: despite the rhetoric that we have just heard from the honourable member for Mayo-I cannot see him in the House; he was here for five minutes effectively to restate what his press release of earlier today said-the proposition that is before the House is not a de facto tariff; it is not an effective tariff; it is not a tariff; it is a sales tax measure designed to raise revenue. The fact that it applies equally to imported vehicles as well as to those produced locally means that it does not infringe any of the GATT rules. The so-called expert, who is no longer with us and who the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) told us would tell us how effectively this infringed the GATT situation, was wrong. It does not infringe the GATT circumstances and that ought to be understood by honourable members on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is the suggestion of legislation by decree. I simply say that this is not the first piece of sales tax revenue legislation that has been introduced into this House for which the date of operation has been effective by virtue of the announcement of the measure versus the date on which it is passed in this House. Budget changes have been implemented in the past without administrative disruption or legal uncertainty, contrary to what has been suggested by those on the other side. There have been many circumstances in which tax rate changes to sales tax measures typically apply from the date of announcement rather then the date of effective passage of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I endorse the point put by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 1990 will occupy very much time in the House of Representatives but may need very careful scrutiny in the Senate, because the Bill has the support of the Government, the Opposition, the Queensland Government, the Queensland Opposition and the tourist industry. I think that should warn us that this legislation may need more careful consideration. In fact, the Bill is simply to deal with what appears to be a possible technical defect in the management plan for the Great Barrier Reef that has arisen due to a decision by a magistrate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The management plan provides that it is permissible to operate a vessel in the reef area. However, it requires the permission of an agency, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, to carry out tourist activities. A tourist operator who has been carrying tourists to a particular island was challenged by the authorities and taken to court, and the court made the decision that, since it was permissible to operate a craft, the activities undertaken by the operator were legal. In effect, the court has raised the possibility that there is virtually no control on access to islands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Government has brought forward a Bill which simply makes it clear that the requirements on tourist operators do apply in these circumstances and the Bill has the support of the Opposition. As I said earlier, it also has the support, as far as the Opposition can ascertain, of the tourist industry generally, of the Government of Queensland, and of the various Opposition parties in the Queensland Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing I would wish to say is that I suppose this is one of the many examples of areas where there is a common ground between the Government and the Opposition on an issue of considerable environmental significance. This Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was, I think, originally conceived by the Whitlam Government but was actually brought into legal effect by the Fraser Government and, of course, it has the bipartisan support of all honourable members in this chamber. I commend the Bill for speedy passage at a time when we are under a guillotine. I think that an hour has been allowed for this Bill and I am fascinated that there will be at least another four speakers and I wish to leave them as much time as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am well prepared. It is just that I would have liked to hear more from the other side and, perhaps, to have worked off it a bit.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I have not been there, but perhaps I will go. It is in my State. The People magazine wrote up a little blue between an island operator and the Commonwealth Government as `Scrapping skipper scuppers bureaucrats'. The particular fellow who had sought to ply his trade between the coast and Green Island had found that there was a loophole in the legislation which meant that he could take an unspecified number of tourists across to Green Island at will, and he did so; in fact, he took 1,600 in the first week of operation free, so confident was he that he could make a quid out of that trade. He had also done a similar thing in Victoria. He scuppered the bureaucrats and evaded the normal processes that would have denied him access to the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose it raises the question of how one manages a very sensitive area without being unfair to potential operators. In essence, the Government has to grant one licence to a particular person, in this case, to ferry people from Cairns, or thereabouts, to Green Island. It is a good illustration, I guess, of the sensitivity of controlling the marine park. I give great credit to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and its officers for the manner in which they do that. </PARA>
<PARA> What has to be understood is that the marine park is not a single entity in the sense that it is not a national park. It has achieved World Heritage listing, but it is not regarded as a single entity throughout. For instance, Green Island is regarded as a national park under a State Act, but it simply comes within one zone of the entire region of the Marine Park Authority. So it has to be treated under a set of criteria that are far different from those which apply in respect of a number of other regions within the Authority. Green Island is one of the more sensitive regions, and it has to be treated accordingly. But this particular operator saw an opportunity to take many more people onto the island than it could ever possibly sustain. It is that question of sustainability that we might ponder on for a couple of minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there had been a study by the Queensland Government. It recommended a definite limit on the number of people taken onto Green Island because of the influence of the movement of people, the movement around the place, and the fact that the various things they would leave on the island might upset the ecology somewhat. That advice went to the Authority and it was quite definite that there should be only a very limited number of people visiting that island at any one time, and therefore the Authority made sure that it licensed just one operator to take a given number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> That raises a problem of the Government awarding a single licence in order to restrict the number of people who can enter the island and, in effect, that gives that licence great value. But I do not see any way around that. If a government is to handle sensitively the number of people who can have access to an area and thereby allow some development of the area and allow those people who wish to see Green Island and other parts of the marine park to do so, then it has to be done with certain restrictions. This becomes the essence and the role of the Authority. I think it does it pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years, it has had to hatch a management plan for the different parts of the Authority. There are many parts of the Great Barrier Reef where there are no restrictions other than that there should be no oil drilling or mining, which was the whole purpose of introducing the Authority before, I think, 1981. It was World Heritage listed in 1981. There are far more sensitive areas which are used exclusively for scientific studies. There should be no use other than scientific study. </PARA>
<PARA> Green Island is a sort of intermediate area under a marine national part B zone where it is permissible to have tourist and educational facilities and tourist cruise ships. Our hero in question, who came up from Victoria to Queensland and saw that he could make money out of transferring people from Cairns to Green Island, obviously had good legal advice. It was possible for him, without licence, to ply his trade. He was correct. He found a loophole and the magistrate agreed with him. We now have to go through this process of tightening up that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> It serves as an illustration that the Government has been firm on the issue. It has to manage well enough to give access to a sufficient number of people and it has had to gain the confidence of the public by giving it access to this very sensitive area. At the same time, it must not ruin the area. That is the issue. The matter drew great headlines around Cairns in some of the more common media outlets. It was seen to be a great battle by this little operator against the titan Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to support the amendment to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. I congratulate the Authority for its excellent management of the marine park. I am pleased that it has been so sensitive and has had enough ability in the management that it has allowed good access by a sufficient number of people. It has rewarded those sufficiently interested by letting them see that environment; they can actually get on and off but not ruin the place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, which we are amending tonight with bipartisan support, was one of the great successes of the Fraser Liberal Government in the environment area. It was introduced despite the opposition of the then Queensland Government and, I remind the Parliament, the tourist industry itself. It is equally proper for me to remind the House that the tourist industry has since become the greatest supporter of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and, from my own knowledge, works very closely with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fair assessment to say that those authorised tour boat operators who already operate to the Great Barrier Reef and in particular to Green Island with proper permits are very environmentally conscious, as all members of this Parliament who have taken advantage of those tourist attractions on the reef can attest. </PARA>
<PARA> As has already been made clear in this debate-although the length of the speeches make it a short debate-the need for the amendment arises from a decision six months ago by a magistrate in Queensland regarding a ferry operator taking tourists to Green Island without a permit. I shall not traverse the ground covered in the second reading speech. But I agree that there is an urgency for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Bill to pass through the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke in this House on 28 November 1988, when another amendment Bill to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was put through the Parliament, again with bipartisan support, I said that one of the constant problems with the major area which we are trying to protect is to maintain it in a natural format while at the same time allowing people to enjoy it. The Bill before us covers this very point. </PARA>
<PARA> The tour boat industry has become environmentally positive. This is just as well, for it is one of the fastest growing sections of the Australian tourist industry. It will continue to grow and attract not only domestic Australian tourists but also European, Asian and Japanese visitors. There can be no doubting that the real increase in tourism to Australia from overseas visitors will be in the coastal area from Cairns through to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> But tonight I would like to concentrate for a moment or two on the Cairns section of the park. Let me tell the House that one of the real growth sporting activities among tourists is diving. Already we have large numbers in particular of Swedes, Danes, Swiss and French tourists coming to the north looking for reef and rainforest experiences. Worldwide, the Caribbean is being polluted, the Red Sea has lost its attractions, and the huge United States diving fraternity is looking for fresh fields. </PARA>
<PARA> The Maldive Islands are attracting tourists at the rate of six charter flights a day from Europe and there is no comparison between what the Maldives have to offer and what the Great Barrier Reef offers. The potential for tourist development in the Cairns section of the park is almost limitless. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking tonight about one ferry operator, per se, but a realistic and-if I can use the current term-sustainable development of this unique natural phenomenon which, if it is destroyed or damaged severely, will no longer attract the very tourists who will bring massive tourist dollars to Australia. So in further developing the tourist industry in the northern area, we have to be very sensible and sensitive as to how we protect both the rainforests and, as we are doing tonight, the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time left to me let me tell the House just how real the prospects for tourist development to the north really are. Thanks to my colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) who is unquestionably the most informed person we have ever had in the Parliament on matters relating to aviation, airports and tourism--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, if she is not aware of it, that those companies already operating into Cairns are Qantas, Air New Zealand, Air Nuigini, Continental, JAL and Thai International. Landing rights for Cairns Airport are already held by All Nippon Airways, Singapore, Hawaiian, United, American, UTA, Canadian Airlines International and Solomon Island Airways. I am further informed that Malaysian Airways, North West Airways and Lauda Air would like to operate in and out of Cairns. The future, therefore, for Cairns is absolutely limitless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hour is late and we are being guillotined by a government which wants to have the House of Representatives meet for a mere seven days in a period of eight months. Consequently, I do not have the time or, might I say at 10 to 12, the inclination to develop some further ideas on the running of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Almost as an aside, therefore, I would congratulate the executive and all its staff of specialists and rangers for a job that continues to be done very well. It is no easy task to balance the need for protecting the unique natural wonder of the reef while, at the same time, allowing as many people as possible to not only enjoy it but also be inspired by it all. </PARA>
<PARA> Having lived in north Queensland for a considerable period of my life and having enjoyed the wonders of the Great Barrier Reef from one end to the other, I remain very anxious that it should remain as near as possible to its natural format despite ravage from either natural cause or man-made intrusion. I am equally anxious that as many people as possible can share the joys and pleasures I have had from it over the years. I am also pleased that a developing tourist industry can grow around it, with financial stability and reward based on proper ecological protection. As the Minister said in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Both Labor and Coalition governments in the past supported the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious we are still doing that by virtue of our bipartisan support of this amending Bill and the need for it to be passed through the Parliament urgently. </PARA>

I am also delighted to see at the table the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). I am sure they will make an excellent bipartisan team on the majority of environmental issues that I am sure will come before this Parliament in the next three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation has had a very longstanding interest in the Barrier Reef. The Committee has made a number of visits there. Its members are very familiar with the operations of the Marine Park Authority. As a committee we are well aware, as we were in the last Parliament, of the very special need to protect what probably is the most prestigious tourist attraction in this country. As a single item it is probably responsible for drawing more tourists than any other attraction that we have to offer. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) and other members who have spoken tonight. This is a very important issue. It is good to see it settled once again on a bipartisan basis. These little anomalies occur from time to time. It is very good to see one cleared up so quickly. I could go on and speak a little bit about recent approvals for the continued dumping of rubbish in the sea adjacent to Heron Island, one of our lovely tourist spots, but that would perhaps detract from the bipartisan aspect of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I could also speak about the reference that is made to oil tankers and other ships that may be heading south or be bound for other countries such as New Zealand using the reef passage. In spite of this legislation, they would still be entitled to use the reef passage, using international law as their defence. In mentioning that, of course, I am mindful of the tremendous disasters that have occurred throughout the world as a result of oil tankers coming to grief. We in this House and others need to be very mindful of the operations of any large ships that may cause even the most minute damage to that magnificent area. The precautions in place ought to be sufficient to make sure that damage never happens in that part of this great country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to thank all members of the House for their support for this important legislation, and particularly for the bipartisan support across this chamber. I would also like to place on record my thanks for honourable members' contributions to the debate and for making the effort to thank the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority because it is important that we pay tribute to its contribution. I am very pleased that honourable members believe we are getting the balance right between access and protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also think it is very good that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) made those very positive comments about those covered by the tourist side of the portfolio now appreciating the value of the environment. I do not see those two sides of the portfolio in any form of conflict at all. I think we will find that one of the great things we have to offer in this country is our reputation on the environment and the areas that we have protected. I think particularly in the European Community, as the honourable member for Cook outlined, people will find that World Heritage areas, particularly in the Northern Territory and the Great Barrier Reef, will be huge tourist attractions for the future. It is important that we keep the right balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) made reference to a couple of points to which I will refer briefly. With regard to the Heron Island issue, we are very conscious of that problem. We have had discussions with the operators there. I think that that issue will be resolved. The other issue that he talked about was the need for pilots to be provided through the Great Barrier Reef area. I totally support that. It is an issue that we are trying to push in the international arena. I thank honourable members for their contributions. In return, whenever they want to visit the Great Barrier Reef, they should let us know so that we can extend to them as much hospitality as possible and give them a very good tour. It is a most beautiful area which is owned by all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter for the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). I ask the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who is at the table, to take note of my comments because they concern a very important issue. One of the major concerns in country towns throughout Australia is the provision and availability of health services. In many towns bush nursing hospitals have been built with funds which have been raised by local people, with three main objectives in mind: firstly, to provide a backup for the doctor during his absence by employing a certain number of trained nursing staff; secondly, to provide hospital beds for members of the local community for observation and treatment of uncomplicated conditions which might otherwise have necessitated admission to a larger institution, such as a base hospital 30 or 40 kilometres away; and thirdly, to provide for the care of the chronically ill, such as those who have suffered strokes, close to their families so that they can be visited frequently, and to provide care for the frail elderly who lack facilities at home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These bush nursing hospitals were regarded as private hospitals and did not qualify for the grants provided to larger hospitals by Federal and State governments. When Medicare was introduced, promising universal health care without charge, many people who had previously been contributing to one or other of the health funds dropped their membership and many others found the cost of remaining in one of the funds too great a financial strain. This resulted in a reduction in the number of people who qualified for admission to their local bush nursing hospital, with the result that the number of admissions fell and the income of the hospitals fell accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Korong Bush Hospital at Wedderburn had to mortgage the building in order to pay the staff wages. Because no money was forthcoming from Federal or State sources it has now closed. The Government, through the Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services, has promised $45,000 for the establishment of community health facilities. This was promised during the Federal election campaign. To date, no money has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no mistake about it: one cannot have a doctor in these towns without the support of a hospital, and vice versa. If neither exists there will be no pharmacy, either. Young married people with families need the assurance of easily accessible medical assistance. If that is not available, they will not come to or remain in the country towns. Already the average age of residents of country towns is rising substantially and before long the majority of the population will be made up of age pensioners. The towns will be faced with extinction, and all for the sake of trivial financial outlay by the Government. It is essential that both the Federal and State governments commit themselves to the retention of bush nursing hospitals and district hospitals throughout Victoria and Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the House tonight a matter related to the subject brought up by the previous speaker. I refer to medical services. I have a message from one of my constituents in Mundijong, who brings up the issue of charges made out to him for pathology services which were ordered by a medical practitioner. It is not uncommon for this to happen. When one goes to a doctor to have tests, from time to time pathology services are needed and it is never the case that the patient gets to talk to the pathologist about medical fees. The patient is then put in a position in which, the services having been ordered on his behalf by his agent, a medical practitioner who has no interest in the size of the account, he has to pay the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said for a number of years that what I believe should happen is that, where medical services are delivered, there should be a fee negotiated on a collective basis. I have never advocated that members of the medical profession should be short-changed. I have always believed that they should be rewarded adequately for their services, their experience and their knowledge. In the case I have just outlined, with pathology services delivered on behalf of Mr Herring of 10 Adonis Street, Mundijong, he never had a chance to negotiate the fees with the pathologist. I suppose this is very much a case of a person going into hospital for an operation, having complications and having to have medical services over and above those which he anticipated when he went in. In these circumstances the medical accounts can sometimes be quite large, particularly for people who are privately insured. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country when one takes out private insurance one does not end up paying less; one ends up paying more. The simple fact is that if one is a public patient and has treatment as a public patient in a private or public hospital, the medical practitioner can charge only the schedule fee. But if one is a private patient in a private or public hospital, there is no limit on the charge that one may face. For Mr Herring the charges were quite large. He had no way of knowing what they would be. There was no negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason I believe that members of the medical profession should sit down collectively with consumer groups and insurers and work out a reasonable charge for any service. It should be worked out so as not to short-change the medical profession, but when it has been worked out they should stick to it so that predictably the insurance fund, whether it be private or public, can pay that charge in full. Unless we get to that stage, we are stepping into the unknown. One really does not know what the charge might be. Some people who have had major operations such as heart surgery have had to sell their home to pay the medical bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the most important things that society can do is make sure its citizens are well protected for health services. This is one of our most basic functions. For this reason it is not unreasonable that the medical profession negotiate its fees on a collective basis and then stick to them. Until we get to that stage, many Australians will face bills higher than they would otherwise incur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up much time at this time of the night. I received word today from two of my constituents who received a letter from the Divisional Returning Officer (DRO) for not having voted on 24 March. On inquiry, we found that 1,700 letters had been sent out in my electorate to those who had not voted. This is according to the rules and according to law. The only problem is that the two constituents who got in touch with my office today had in fact voted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has caused me to refer in the Parliament tonight to two issues which concern me about polling day. One is the reduction in staff at the polling booths, which caused a phenomenal bank-up of voters early in the morning. Throughout my electorate we had long queues at all polling booths. At some of the booths these queues lasted until two or three o'clock in the afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> This was caused by two problems. First, as I have mentioned, there was a policy decision to reduce staff numbers. The second problem involves a broader situation which I hope will be changed-this business of allowing people to vote anywhere in the electorate, to no longer have subdivisional requirements for voting at polling booths. It was my observation this time that as well as the reduced numbers and the new, fancy interior design, there was a problem with the requirement for polling clerks to go through the whole roll to find appropriate names. Over the last few weeks I have had word from several of these polling clerks who said it caused great confusion, with great queues of people lining up to vote. I hope that we will look at allowing electorate-wide voting without an absentee requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these are the reasons why 1,700 letters have gone out. Understandably, but totally regrettably, letters have gone out from the DRO informing people that they have not voted and telling them how much they are to be fined. I hope that the Minister in charge of electoral matters and any committee that may be formed in this Parliament will look very closely at this because here we have a precise example of the stupidity that emanated from a system that did not work properly in the recording of votes in the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) talked about the last election. I raise a matter which interested me soon after we came back for Parliament. The election was held on 24 March. On my first trip back to Canberra following the election, I was on an Ansett Airlines flight and I happened to look in the place where the magazines are kept and I noticed a New Idea. I was a bit bored and thought that I would just sit and read through the New Idea. I read through the magazine. I was not interested in most of the articles in it but I came to an advertisement for the Australian Labor Party. I looked at the date of this issue of the New Idea, which was 31 March. But it came out, strangely enough, during the week prior to the election. The advertisement depicted what the Labor Party had done for the environment. Lo and behold it referred to the save the Franklin River campaign, the Daintree rainforests having been saved, the Antarctic, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought it was too much of a coincidence that this New Idea, from Murdoch Press, should be in the Ansett plane a week before the election, depicting all the things that the Labor Party has done for the environment. Of course, in my normal fashion I lodged a complaint. The very nice fellow from Ansett said to me, `Well, Bruce, it's just a coincidence. They advertised and we thought we would have it in the plane during the week of the election.' I said, `Come on!'. </PARA>
<PARA> Then I looked the other way and saw my old friend, Ted Harris, from Australian Airlines. He used to be the manager of Ampol, the great Australian company that sold a parcel of crude to ACTU-Solo when I was in the oil industry. I thought, `I've got nowhere to go. We haven't got a Tasmanian airline and I have got to come here some way. I haven't got much of a choice.' But I thought, what a coincidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I will get off that subject. It is too late to complain about it. The election is over, we lost and we have to take it on the chin. But I am here tossing my little head around and saying what we should be doing; and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) who is sitting at the table can smile. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to say is that when I first came here to Canberra 15 years ago, I had a preconceived idea of the people of Canberra. I thought to myself, `The streets are lined with gold. They have all got three jobs. They are all public servants tumbling over each other to get to the top'. But I have been pleasantly surprised. They are not like that at all. They are just very ordinary people. The people I have met in this Parliament-the attendants and the people who serve me-have all been most decent. All the other people that I have associated with have been good people. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, one of them said to me, `Bruce, we don't get very much credit'. I said, `Neither do I'. He said, `We collected $1,600 for the flood victims'. In this little Parliament, in their own little social gatherings, they collected $1,600. I thought, `There you are; goodness is rewarded'. I thought tonight would be an opportunity to thank them, and to thank them for the 15 years they have given me. They changed my idea of what the people of Canberra are like, and I might change some of the preconceived ideas that people in little Tassie or big Western Australia might have of Canberra. </PARA>
