<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, this legislation relates in part to the companies Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and Esso, and, although there is no formal requirement for me to do so, as a matter of courtesy to the House I mention that I have a direct beneficial shareholding in one of those companies-namely, BHP. Those who like riveting reading might like to apply to read the members' interests register, but I think they will be pretty disappointed should they proceed down that path. However, that opportunity is available to members of the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill come before the House for further debate following the latest oil shock caused by the Middle East situation and the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. That situation has driven up crude oil prices variously through the $30 mark and the $40 mark, and then up and down around those levels, and that has resulted in massive increases in petrol prices in Australia. In the fuel taxation situation in Australia, we have increased revenue for the Federal Government, although the ultimate extent of that increase will not be known for some time yet because of various factors which apply in circumstances such as we have at this time. What it does mean for so many people trying to eke out a living in these tough economic times is that they have an added burden-a horrific burden-to bear, especially when they are located in areas where there is little or no public transport, which is so much of provincial Australia, as well as in areas where, by the nature of their business operation, they are required to use considerable amounts of fuel-be they in inland Australia, coastal Australia or, indeed, capital city Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Speaker, the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill and the first section of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill seek to impose an excise in relation to any oilfield in Australia where production exceeds 30 million barrels. The second part of this cognate legislation relates to the regular adjustments to excise associated with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and the third part relates to BHP and Esso and definitions of `old' and `new' oil in respect of Bass Strait and, particularly, the developmental well which found the Tuna L separate oil reservoir. I will deal with the three parts in turn but, before doing so, I say that on an overall basis the coalition is not opposed to the legislation in the broad sense as we do recognise that it is in part a follow through from the original 1987 parent legislation. I would remind the House that the coalition did not oppose the original legislation at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are a number of key matters which must be addressed in the course of this debate and which will be pursued by me and by my colleagues in this House and also the Senate. Australia cannot be complacent about its oil and energy situation. The big Bass Strait fields which served Australia so well over a critical period of years are now facing decline, and with so much of Australia underexplored we must encourage the industry to get out and look for replacement oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Government has at last heeded the calls of the industry and the coalition and is attempting to further encourage oil exploration and reduce the tax burden on sections of the industry. The decision to replace the excise and royalty system on Bass Strait oil with a resource rent tax (RRT) is one such action and the coalition will examine the specific legislation on this aspect of the Budget when it is introduced into the House in November. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the specific and overall policy settings are important to encourage oil exploration and production. Maintaining a fair go approach is important to maintaining oil exploration and production in Australia when the odds are stacked against us, when the expenses are massive and it costs millions of dollars just to sink one well in a prospective field, especially when it is an offshore well. The chances are it could be a dry well. There could be 10 dry wells in a row, and suddenly a company, or the syndicate involved, is up for $100m of expenditure without the prospect of one dollar's return, and then the eleventh well might come good. There is a great risk factor involved and when reward is achieved, when oil is struck, we want a consistent approach by Government and not one saying, `Oh well, you did all the hard work; you have now found the oil and we are going to vary, alter or further increase the taxation regime associated with that oil find'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add one other dimension to dealing with this legislation on the broad front. I refer to the alternative approach that the coalition is now offering as a very sharp alternative, as radical surgery, to our taxation regime. May I remind the House that under our goods and services tax package, which has been launched by the Liberal and National parties, sales tax on oils, greases and lubricants will be abolished; sales tax on motorcycles and car parts and accessories will be abolished; and sales tax on detergents will be abolished. Sales tax on glues and starches, just to pick some other areas, will be abolished and even sales tax on toothpaste will be abolished as part of that goods and services tax package. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular significance in the context of this policy is the fact that we will be abolishing those sales taxes on oils, lubricants and greases as we come to a sensible situation with regard to taxation in this country. As part of that we will also be providing a rebate from the goods and services tax on fuel used in business and farming. That is a significant measure and reflects our concern and our priority with regard to fuel taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also clarify that the cognate legislation before the House is separate from the resource rent tax legislation which will be coming in in November. It does not in a direct sense relate to the petroleum products excise, but it does relate to the three areas which I now turn to. </PARA>
<PARA> The first area under consideration relates to the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill and the first part of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. This aspect brings a requirement to pay excise onshore and elsewhere outside of the Bass Strait area if in fact an oilfield exceeds the 30 million barrel threshold, as it is expected the Jackson oilfield will do in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> However, contrary to the implication of the second reading speech of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), our best advice is that no excise will ever be recovered from Jackson because the annual production is expected to fall below the second leg of the trigger mechanism, some three million barrels per year. Unless it triggers that second leg this legislation would not apply to the Jackson field. Since those comments were made and fleshed out in an Estimates committee I notice that the Minister in his second reading speech last week has added to the list of oilfields which may or not at some future date require this legislation in terms of the excise requirements of the legislation. My colleagues, particularly in the Senate, will be pursuing that aspect further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose the intent of the legislation. However, we do not agree with the proposition as it stands that a particular aspect of this cognate legislation should be retrospective to the end of 1987 or the commencement of 1988. The Minister, by his own admission, said that no fuel has become eligible for this excise. In proof of that the Government has not even got around to legislating until 1990 with regard to this dimension of this complex legislation. The Government is now starting to legislate because the Jackson field, the first field that might trigger the mechanism, is coming up to the 30 million barrel mark. If that is so, why not make the commencement of this particular aspect of the legislation prospective from a point in the future, from the date of royal assent of this legislation, so that one does not have unnecessary legislation applying to a three-year period, for which there is no requirement on the statute books?</PARA>
<PARA> The absolute proof of that is that the Government has not previously legislated for this until now. It is anticipating a certain possibility; we have no problem with that. The Government has no real justification for making this legislation retrospective. It would be far more sensible to make it prospective. We are advised that that will simply require the publication of a new regulation with respect to Bass Strait; so be it. But to backdate this legislation is academic in the sense that no field is required to pay the excise involved. Therefore, I signal that in the committee stage the coalition will move amendments to the legislation to give effect to endeavouring to make it prospective from the date of royal assent of the legislation. That is a very sensible, reasonable approach, given all the factors involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill relates to the adjustment of the excise duty for naturally occurring LPG. This is adjusted each year on 1 April and 1 October in accordance with the existing policy, although there will perhaps be some change to that from January next year. The excise rate will be amended with effect from 1 April 1990 from zero to 5.78c per kilolitre. The increase reflects the higher export prices obtained for LPG over the six months to March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is not opposed to this measure. It has not opposed previous adjustments and it is not opposed to the commencement date which is quite properly drawn into this part of the Bill. Our amendments will skirt around this part of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and final area is one with complex ramifications for industry, and one which I want to highlight to the House. It relates to an attempt by the Government, almost in the middle of the night, or in the latter stages of sitting last week, to tack on to this Bill some retrospective changing of the rules whilst a case is part heard before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) in respect of a particular developmental well and oil accumulation in Bass Strait. I refer, of course, to the Tuna L oilfield which the Government, the Opposition and industry all regard as being a separate oil deposit. This particular deposit was found by a developmental well rather than a wildcat or exploration well. There has been a significant debate for many years over whether it is old oil or new oil. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that this legislation merely pertains to the period from 1984 to 1990 and seeks to adjust the rules to declare, by way of legislation, but absolutely, that this well is old oil and that the excise tax at the higher rate will be paid, has been paid and will continue to be paid until that regime is completely supplanted by the new RRT budget regime when that legislation is passed by both Houses of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is unashamedly trying to correct its past errors by retrospectively legislating away the existing rights of the Bass Strait partners, BHP and Esso. Not content with that, it is also intending to use its legislative powers to interfere in effect with the course of hearings currently before the AAT. This is the relevant body empowered to consider and determine this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation under consideration, I emphasise, seeks to alter retrospectively the provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 so as to legalise payments already made under the apparently mistaken impression on the part of the Government that the Tuna oilfield, in terms of the Government's ruling and in terms of the period covered by the legislation-1984 onwards-contains old oil and has hence been liable for the higher rate of excise rather than that applying to new oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the measure proposed by the Government will foist the consequence of the Government's bad drafting of legislation in that 1983-84 period onto the two corporate citizens involved, who are, I believe, whether they are large or small firms, entitled to a consistent fair go under the laws of the land. Previous governments may have made mistakes in respect of this matter. The current Government may have made a mistake, but the current Government sought to legislate its intent. It drew up legislation and now suddenly, six years later, it seeks to amend that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that it is inconsistent with our longstanding view that the Commonwealth should not legislate against potentially adverse findings of bodies who have been empowered to resolve such matters. I suppose the Government would contend for its part that it is merely legislating retrospectively to support the status quo and the stated intent of the Government when it launched the new definition of new oil and old oil in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the companies paid up on what might be termed ministerial reliance but with legal reservations, with a degree of protest which, following further review of the legal circumstance, resulted in lodgment of formal protest payments from March 1990 and the commencement of the proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The matter is set down for a preliminary hearing before the AAT in just a few days time. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of this part of the legislation in terms of its fundamental contents is not in dispute. The commencement date is the matter we are addressing in our amendment. We are opposed to this legislation being retrospective but not opposed to a prospective commencement. In any event, again this will all become by degrees academic when the RRT legislation is considered. If passed by the Parliament, it will supplant the excise and the old and new definitional structure of oil in Bass Strait and, hopefully, it will help simplify what is an extraordinarily complex area of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, I wish to move an amendment on behalf of the coalition to make this aspect of the legislation commence from the day of royal assent. I concede that the amendments, which have now been circulated and which as a matter of courtesy we signified to the Government yesterday, were quite complex to draft-we had to ensure that our intent of making the legislation prospective was correctly delivered-and I accept that the Government might submit some comment on that aspect. But our intention is very clear: it is not to interfere in any way, shape or form with the LPG changes in the legislation; it is merely to make this a prospective change and not a retrospective change. I emphasise that the Government should not legislate against potentially adverse findings of bodies such as the AAT, which has the fundamental responsibility of resolving the matter at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Could I add just one other thing: the timetable for consideration of this legislation is unnecessarily short. The inability of the Government to schedule its legislative program, I have to confess, is always a difficulty, no matter which government is in power, but we are about to enter the last 10 sitting days of the House in this first year of a new decade. We are about to be deluged with bucketfuls of legislation from the Budget; much of it we have yet to see. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of this Bill, it was introduced into the Parliament last Wednesday. It is being debated today-Wednesday. On this occasion we have had a week. The Minister would be well aware of the procedures where minutes have to be prepared and consultations made. We had no warning of this third leg of the Bill and it means that effectively we have just 24 hours to draw up a response to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I predict that matters will deteriorate further over these next 10 precious sitting days of the Federal House of Representatives in this new decade, bringing up the lowest number of sitting days of the House of Representatives for many decades. That aspect is a disgrace, but I realise that the Minister at the table is not directly involved with the scheduling of the sittings. However, he might like to put his pennyworth in to ensure that we have longer sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> In this cognate legislation before the House, the core issue is the definition of old oil and new oil. There are several facts that I will highlight. First, by its content, this legislation is retrospective as it seeks to take the commencement back to 1 July 1984. That is on the front cover. We are legislating in 1990 to introduce these amendments back to 1 July 1984. So, as a matter of absolute fact, it is retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is a matter of absolute fact that the matters covered by these amendments in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990, the matters in dispute, are before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I am sure the Minister will not dispute that. The matter is part heard before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal between the partners Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Esso, on the one hand, and the Federal Government on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, however the Ministers may rule it is the legislative framework which should ultimately decide these matters and on which the AAT should rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, under other regulations, the reality is that the two companies can only effectively claim a 12-month period from March 1989 to March 1990 and then the period from March 1990 to July. This is an area which no doubt will be further debated, but section 53-overriding of regulations-would make it clear that the reality on balance will be that it will be for just a one year and four months period that the application of any refund of excise paid will be refunded to the companies involved. That was the case. I am advised that the amount would be around $30m. Those who would argue that this will cause it to go right back to 1984 have to test that against section 53 and against the declared intention of the companies involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs a consistent and fair-minded approach to its oil taxation regime. We are paying a price for excessively complex taxation structures on the oil industry. I accept that the previous coalition Government had a role in that, as has the present Government. But we have to analyse this legislation very carefully. On its fundamentals, the coalition has no objection. The commencement dates are the focus of our objections. We seek to make them prospective. That is why I will move amendments to that end in the committee stage on these cognate Bills. Our approach to this legislation is fair and correct. It is the approach which will do more for the national interest in encouraging a fair deal for those who risk a great deal in going out to find oil, oil that is especially precious as the world adjusts to the latest horrific developments in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always like to follow the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) because I find that his contributions are always interesting. Certainly, they are always tinged with some honest admissions and a number of facts, but he also tends to allow a bit of ideological bent to get in front of sound thinking. Once again, we have had him cover the full agenda this morning. I am glad that the Opposition is accepting the thrust of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill. I note the honourable member's comments about the fact that this industry has had a very messy tax regime for some years and that those years certainly precede the election of the Hawke Government. As the honourable member said, it is a long term industry and the decisions that are being made and the taxation regimes that are put in place have to be viewed in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand the honourable member's point of view about the retrospectivity of the legislation, but it is not as though the ideas contained in this legislation are new to the industry; they have been signalled by the Government now for quite some time. The industry leaders have beaten a constant path to our Ministers' doors ever since we were elected, and they were well aware that these were the directions in which legislation would go. A number of tax regimes have been mooted for change-and industry leaders made their investment and exploration decisions knowing about these changes-but existing agreements and trends in a number of areas still have a course to run. In fact, I see this legislation playing a role by introducing a sunset or a ruling off of the line on a number of existing arrangements and tidying them up, so that there is a clear field for the industry to work to in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I pick up a couple of observations made by the honourable member for Farrer about the tax regime and the Opposition's proposal as it relates particularly to a goods and services tax. He went through a nice long list of products and said that when the Opposition introduced its goods and services tax-if it is ever in a position to do so-there would be no sales tax on this item and that item. His words were very specific, as they needed to be. He did not say that there would be no goods and services tax on them. If I understand the proposal for a broad based goods and services tax with no general exemptions, then either we are talking--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Except for business inputs. He is talking about picking inputs along the line and saying that there will be no tax at that level, but, of course, the tax will be applied at the consumer end when the consumer pays for the final product. I do not quite understand how there will not be a sales tax on toothpaste, for instance, but I presume that there will be a goods and services tax on toothpaste. I am not really here to pick points with the honourable member for Farrer about what will have a sales tax on it and what will have a goods and services tax on it. The point I am really trying to make is that the sums do not add up. As has been made clear by our side of the House from the day that this proposition was wheeled in, the sums do not add up. The Opposition cannot abolish the whole sales tax regime and replace it with a retail goods and services tax, which in many ways is simply substituting one tax for another, and then say to the Australian public, `As well as that, we are going to give you tax cuts'-and that is the core of this-unless the money for the tax cuts comes from somewhere else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The core of the logic is that the money from somewhere else is in fact to come from the proposed sale of Telecom Australia. One might say that Telecom has not got much to do with this petroleum excise debate, and I am not going to spend much time on it except to say that the honourable member for Farrer has used this debate to, once again, flag the goods and services tax and talk about the way in which it will have relation to inputs, particularly lubricants, greases and fuel used as business inputs. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the efforts of the honourable member for Farrer, as the new Leader of the National Party, to rebuild a rural constituency for his side of politics, a constituency which his Party has lost to our side of politics over quite some time with the many rural members who now sit--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are very good members, as the honourable member for Grey says. He now represents about a quarter of Australia's land size out there in South Australia. The point is that this proposal to sell Telecom Australia and actually subsidise the goods and services tax will come back to haunt the Leader of the National Party in his own constituency. Nobody in Australia understands better the rural cross-subsidy in telephone charges and nobody in Australia understands better the need for the publicly owned telephone enterprise to be providing those services than his own rural constituency. I guarantee right now that sometime between now and the election this proposal to sell Telecom will be either watered down or his National Party colleagues will walk away from it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Let me also take a couple of minutes to make some observations on the oil and petroleum prices at the moment. On the whole, the Opposition has been very honest about this. I suppose that I am directing these comments more to the automobile associations and others. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who have never been honest, as the honourable member for Grey says, with their approach to things. They are now running around with this claim that because of the current crisis in the Middle East the Government is making windfall profits out of its petrol tax. Firstly, I want to make it quite clear to people that this is not the case. The Government's budgeted revenue from fuel excise and from resource rent tax based on oil taken from Bass Strait and elsewhere is based on world parity price judgments. If I remember correctly, the budgeted estimate is something like $28 per barrel. At the moment the world parity price is higher than that, but it is expected to fall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, in the lead-up to the Budget it was below $28 per barrel but predicted to go higher. In other words, the Government has to take a longer term view about what that world parity price will be. It seems that it will fall, on average over the year, pretty much on target. So to be claiming that the Government at the moment is sustaining petrol prices and petrol taxes where they are and that there is a windfall tax is not only wrong in fact, but it is deceitfully wrong and is put deceitfully by those who are running that argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The other more important aspect of it, certainly from my point of view, is that it needs to be understood that the fuel excise of around 27c per litre that the ordinary motorist pays, as distinct from what oil producers pay when they actually mine the resource, is a per litre tax. The figures coming through to us already show a 10 per cent reduction in the use of fuel by motorists during September. That 10 per cent reduction means that there is a 10 per cent reduction in petrol tax raised by the Government. Even though the cost of petrol is higher, the amount that the Government raises as a per litre tax does not go up; it is 27.7c per litre, or whatever the rate is, irrespective of whether the price at the bowser is $1 a litre. The point I am making is that it is a per litre charge and it is a fixed charge. </PARA>
<PARA> One might say that one very good thing coming out of current higher fuel prices, brought about through the situation in the Middle East, is that Australian motorists are finding ways to reduce the use of fuel. If the 10 per cent reduction in fuel use continues, I think we will have to look very seriously at the effect of price on consumption. I know that is a fairly brave thing for a local member to say in the Parliament but that is the fact of the matter. I have no doubt that my opponents will rush out and say that the honourable member for Burke is saying that maybe we should keep prices at this level because that will encourage motorists to use less petrol. In fact, that is the strategy used by many governments around the world. Something never told to motorists by motoring organisations in Australia is that Australians pay the third lowest petrol price in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or international energy measured countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason Australian motorists pay the third lowest petrol price is that Australia has the third lowest petrol tax of those countries. The cost of the crude oil component, the cost of refining the fuel, is much the same in every country; that is, around 25c per litre if we base that at fuel bought at around $24 a barrel. But the amount of tax a government adds to that price makes a difference to how much motorists pay for petrol. Before the Middle East crisis, motorists were paying, in Australian dollars, $1.60 a litre in Italy; around $1.40 a litre in Ireland and England; about $1.30 a litre in France; $1.20 a litre in Sweden; and $1.00 a litre in Japan. This was when Australian motorists were paying about 55c a litre. The only countries charging less for petrol were the United States of America (USA), where petrol cost around 35c a litre when it cost 60c a litre in Australia, and Canada, where the price of petrol was a couple of cents lower than here. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the USA. The USA has continued to run a gas-guzzling V8 regime of a motor industry built on the notion that fuel was in inexhaustible supply and there was no need to conserve it. Americans all ran around driving their gas guzzlers. President Bush has come to understand that this process has destroyed the American automobile industry because the rest of the world is looking for fuel-efficient small cars and the American industry has not been responsive to that. Now there has been a sudden surge in petrol prices and American buyers are not racing to buy a V8 Oldsmobile or Buick; they are looking for a four-cylinder Japanese Mazda that they can get some value out of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Grey has a great sense of humour; I am glad he is here with me. Those circumstances have led to the announcement this week by President Bush that the American Government intends to lift its petrol tax by 10c a gallon. I predict that is only the start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My point is that all around the world countries-governments-are coming to the view that if we are to shake ourselves loose of being held hostage to the fancies and the comings and goings of Middle East oil producers, we must shake ourselves loose of this dependence upon Middle East oil. We must become more self-sufficient in our own oil exploration. Australia has done that very well under this Labor Government. Since 1983 Australia has lifted its locally supplied oil from about 50 per cent to about 80 per cent of oil used in Australia. We have done very well at finding our own oil reserves and increasing our oil exploration. It was only the putting in place by this Government of policies encouraging that which has led to those successes in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing happening around the world is that governments are very deliberately using the policy of higher petrol taxes to cut back use in response to the greenhouse, the environment and the conservation arguments; they have also done so for the argument of pushing along the development of more fuel efficient cars and causing people to look for other forms of transport. The smart governments understand that oil is in fact a finite resource; it is going to run out and the scarcer it gets, the more it will cost. The US, for instance, simply cannot go on running a regime which allows people to buy petrol at 35c a litre, because its fuel policies have encouraged all the wrong habits. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see the Opposition acknowledging that the Government is not trying to make windfall profits out of the current situation. I have a transcript of an interview which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) gave in Melbourne on 27 September. The announcer who was running the program asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What do you make of the Government's idea of the windfall they are making out of oil, petrol more particularly?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition, to his credit, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not clear in my own mind that the net effect on the Budget is positive. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pollie-babble. What it really means is, `I would not be so sure that they are making profits'. `The effect on the Budget might be negative' means that we might make a loss, and that is because motorists are consuming much less fuel; therefore, they are paying much less fuel tax. I am glad that the Opposition is being honest. It could be just scoring points on that issue. But at least it has made an honest admission that that is not the case, and I wish that the motoring associations would be honest with people about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the Opposition basically supports the legislation. As I said earlier, I understand the view that it ought not to be a retrospective piece of legislation, but this is a long term industry and the behaviour in the industry has been based on the assumptions that are incorporated in this legislation. The Government has made its intention to do these things very clear for a long time. So I do not have any difficulty with our introducing the legislation with those time frames in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) gave us an interesting dissertation. The thing that always worries me most is when anybody in politics tells me that he or she is applying a tax for a good, fair and honest reason. I shudder every time the Treasurer-of any party-stands in this place and says that he has to do something for fairness. I well remember the fringe benefits tax. That was going to put more sandwiches in the brown paper bags of people travelling to work on the tram. Yet all of the statistics now tell us that those people are paying more taxation than they did prior to the fringe benefits tax. I do not care what the reason is: the simple fact is that governments collect taxes so that they have more revenue. I apply that to both sides of politics. It ill becomes such a nice, honest man as the honourable member for Burke to try to sell the Australian electorate on the idea that taxation is applied only for its own good. It is a false premise and I object to it at any level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill has been well described by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and I support wholeheartedly the remarks he made today, particularly with regard to our opposition to making this legislation retrospective. It is anathema to me. I am pleased to say that, in conflict with every member of the Labor Party at that time and, unfortunately, with most of my colleagues, I voted against the only substantial retrospective legislation that has ever been introduced in my 10 years in this Parliament. Tomorrow, I think, I shall have been a member of parliament for exactly 10 years. It is the only thing that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I have in common. The Opposition will not support retrospectivity and, as has been pointed out by the Leader of the National Party, it is not necessary in this case. The Bills can be prospective, and that is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed to see that the legislation takes liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into the tax arena for the first time and, although I understand the reasons for that, I think it is a pity. I do not think that our efforts to get more people to use LPG as fuel for their vehicles should be interrupted and, if there is a good reason for getting people to do something, that can best be done by reducing or not introducing taxes. There is a major shift, particularly amongst commercial users, to LPG. Australia has huge resources of gas and, of course, we are well aware that, in terms of emissions from vehicles, gas is a much better fuel and we should encourage people to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, I believe we should discourage State governments and electricity authorities from burning it for the purpose of generating electricity. We have not got that much. LPG is clearly the fuel of mobility for Australians in the future, and I think it should be preserved wherever possible. I even concern myself with the extent we export, but I also know the reasons for that. But the reality is that Australia will be a country that demands mobility through motor vehicles and, of course, tractors and trucks and all the things that support our industry, and we should be at pains to preserve the only two fuels that have any practical application there. Presently, of course, that is liquid hydrocarbons and gas. So we have to go back to coal or nuclear energy for our stationary generation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I read an interesting paper the other day that advised me that a typical coal-fired station will emit into the atmosphere up to 12 tonnes of radioactive material per annum compared, of course, with the emissions of a nuclear station of nil. We will have to confront all sorts of funny things in the years ahead when it comes to energy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this legislation is all about taxation. I think it is a particularly nasty bit of taxation when the Government tries to tell oil producers that oil they have discovered recently-irrespective of its being below another layer of oil-is in fact oil they discovered many years ago. I am right on the side of Esso and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) in their debate with the Government, and I think we do little enough if we again demand that any changes the Government wants to make to the rules of the game should be made prospectively. I believe they should not be made at all. It is clear that a new discovery of oil, even if it is below another layer of oil, is a new discovery. </PARA>
<PARA> But I thought it was interesting just to delve a little into the history of the taxing of fuel in recent times. It has been a very interesting situation. When we look back to 1957 we find that the total collection on fuel was about 4.6c per litre. Of course, at that time when one looks for the changes in the rate of excise, one always finds that it happened about August. The reason for that was that it was a Budget decision. The governments of the day, principally Liberal governments, came to this Parliament and confronted the Australian taxpayer with the announcement that they would increase the excise on fuel and, for that matter, on alcohol and other excisable items. That is true democracy. That is a government confronting its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember during my time in the hotel industry the campaigns that the Australian Hotels Association would run to try to prevent the Government from imposing additional taxes on its industry and, most importantly, its consumers, the Australian taxpayers-because that is where it all ends up, wherever it happens to be originally applied. The facts of life are that the community had the opportunity to resist, and when the tax was increased it clearly understood that government did this openly and through the Budget process. That of course changed around, as I recollect, 1983. I found in my reading of the figures that changes were made in August, August, August, August. In that period, we saw the total amount of excise per litre rise from, let us say, 4.5c to a mere 6.155c. Then suddenly we saw adjustments being made each July or August and then again in February. There was an adjustment in 1983 in July, another in August and then, of course, we had a regular pattern of February-August, February-August with one exception-and that was 1986 when it changed every month. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that this was the time when the Hawke Government came to this Parliament and announced that there would no longer be the adjustment by legislation and the approval of this Parliament; there would be automatic indexation based on, of all things, the consumer price index (CPI). The consumer price index is the most abused index in the world because it is used by local government; it is used by electricity authorities; it is used by water authorities; it is used by governments of every colour to excuse any tax increase they want to apply. In fact, of course, by its very label, it tells us it is an index of cost to consumers-not to government, not to electricity authorities and not to oil producers. The CPI has nothing to do with that. Put in its simplest terms, it is the housewife's cost index and, as such, should be only used in that place. It is quite wrong for an electricity authority, for instance, whose costs are capital, fuel and labour, to claim that the cost of butter, beer and a few other things are indicative to its costs and should be reflected in its price increases. </PARA>
<PARA> It is exactly the same with the price of fuel. What has the consumer price index got to do with taxing the price of fuel? I can tell honourable members what taxing the price of fuel does to the consumer price index. By its very nature and by the link, every time the tax on fuel is increased, the consumer price index is increased-and whacko for government. Every time the tax is put up, the Government is guaranteed another tax increase. I think that is outrageous. Let us please remember that every excisable item is included in the consumer price index: alcohol, cigarettes and, of course, fuels. So it is a nice little trick and it is notable of course that, as I have just pointed out, just prior to that decision, we had seen less than a 2c increase in the tax on fuel in the previous 20 years of Liberal governments. Then, all of a sudden, we get a run on. </PARA>
<PARA> We find, firstly, after the introduction of automatic indexation, the Hawke- Keating Government confronted with another problem-in terms of its revenue, not in the proper management of the Australian economy. There is the interesting history of the application of wellhead taxes, because wellhead taxes were not particularly a problem, until about 1964 when we actually had a discovery of commercial quantities of oil within Australia-and that was the Moonie find. The Moonie producers came along to government and said, `We'd like to sell oil in Australia'. The Government was, of course, delighted with that situation, and yet the producers could not produce oil at the price which was then the world parity price. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand how low that parity price was when one reads that, in 1964-65, the Government agreed to oblige Australian refiners to buy Moonie crude at $3.14 a barrel, about which the industry protested vehemently because it was about 50 per cent above world parity price at the time. But the Government did it for the national good, and I think it was right. A little later in 1967 the Barrow discoveries were made, and a price of $3.24-an additional 10c-was established. We then had the Bass Strait discoveries in 1968 and, again, the price was struck and the obligation was placed upon Australian refineries to buy this oil at $2.47 a barrel. That was substantially above what the producers could have got if they had tried to sell it on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Things then changed. We had the formation of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as a cartel and the very rapid escalation of fuel prices. To take the position of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), it became apparent that Australia could not go on buying oil at $2.47 a barrel when in fact prices had reached $20 to $30 a barrel under the OPEC regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality was that the Fraser Government, in recognising this, also said, `As we've backed you, the producers, over a period of time and have demanded that the Australian consumer pay more for oil than you otherwise would have got, we want you, therefore, to understand that you are not entitled to the entire windfall from this massive rise in profits. We are going to take a substantial amount of that for the Australian taxpayer'. It imposed the parity pricing system which established very large revenues- as I recollect, of the order of $2,000m or $3,000m a year-for the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) once said in this place, the Government got hooked on that revenue. It was never intended to be revenue as such; it was not a taxing measure. It was put there, as the honourable member for Burke described, to discourage consumption and to encourage people to divert their consumption to other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As we now discover in the wool industry, and in many other areas, cartels of that nature do not work for very long. They started to cheat on one another. It has now resulted in a war. The fact of life is that the prices started to fall. I well remember the period when the Treasurer stood up day after day in this Parliament trying to explain why it was not his fault that he was going to have to sustain government revenue by doing away with the policy that now demanded falls in his tax revenue of 5c or 7c a litre, and why he was entitled to keep the money. It was a time when he labelled our then leader `His Oiliness', trying to dump the blame on him. He and I had a classic confrontation at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that in 1986 we saw changes to the oil revenue in February, mid-March, April, mid-May, June, July, mid-July, early August, 19 August, mid-September and October. In that period we saw the excise on fuel rise from 10.43c per litre to at one stage 23.884c per litre.  It was a pure revenue raising measure that has continued to this day where we see 25.9c per litre being levied at the bowser, the place that the Treasurer in opposition once accused the Liberal Government of turning into a tax station. If we did we were pretty moderate by comparison. What is more, when we collected the money we spent up to 75 per cent of it on roads, compared to a lousy 20 per cent today. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke was at pains to say that we are not getting any extra windfall profits. He might be right in that in the end the overall collections might not get up to their estimates because of reduced consumption, but that does not make much difference to the fellow who still has to buy because it is the only way he can get to work or because it enables him to grow crops and to service his farming property or deliver the goods of his production. Those people cannot make judgments to use less. What is happening to them?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Institute of Petroleum publishes figures on this each month. The fact is that at the wellhead the tax is a percentage tax. The honourable member for Burke was at great pains to say quite honestly that the tax at the bowser is cents per litre and that it does not vary other than, of course, as the cents per litre rate goes up, and as it feeds into the consumer price index it will then increase that excise because it is linked to the CPI. There is a rather slowly arriving windfall, because this adjustment is only made every six months, but the windfall at the wellhead is here in the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> At 31 August the crude oil condensate excise-this is the wellhead tax-was 6.1c per litre. A publication on 2 October, a month later, shows that it has risen to 8.5c per litre. The overall government revenue in that period had similarly jumped from 40c per litre to 43.3c per litre when we take into account the State franchise fees, et cetera. We can see that the windfall that the Government is getting on each litre is massive. It is flowing through in the cost. We find that the pump price jumped between 31 August and 2 October from 73.8c to 82c. That is what happened to the consumer. For the Government to suggest that it is not making a windfall, irrespective of the fact that prices may push down the overall revenue, is simply wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain fact of life is that during its operation in this place as the Government the Hawke-Keating Administration has made an art form of collecting taxation in every field. Total tax collections in the last Fraser Budget were set at $44 billion. In the current Keating Budget it is $101 billion. This increase has taken place over a period of seven years. In the fuel area it has continued a taxing policy at a gigantic level; a taxing policy as compared to an economic management policy which was necessary during the heady days of OPEC. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is an attempt to rationalise some of those matters but in the end it is an attempt to gain, wherever possible, additional revenue from oil production for the Government. Anybody who thinks that that is paid by anybody but the consumer is foolish. It is ordinary Australians who must pay it. We know that ordinary Australians have seen since 1950 the share that government takes from their production grow from 15 per cent to 40 per cent. We used to work January and February for the Government and the rest of the year for ourselves; we now work January, February, March, April, May and a little bit of June before we have the right to address the costs of our family and our own savings. This legislation contributes to that. As I said at the beginning of my speech, every time the Government says it is giving us a tax for our own good I shudder because there is no such thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 is to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 to facilitate the calculation of the volware price-that is, the volume weighted average of realised prices of sales of crude oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill provides a basis for collecting excise on crude oil production at Jackson and potentially at other onshore production sites by an equitable and effective system. As it stands the principal Act has the effect of confining the definition of oil producer to those operating offshore. Hence, it is necessary that the definition of `oil producer' be widened to include onshore producers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that no other issue can capture the public's attention quite so dramatically as any mention of excise or pricing as it relates to fuel. This topic strikes a sympathetic note in that most sensitive of nerves, the hip-pocket nerve. However, many members of the public do not understand how excise and import parity pricing operate, except in the most general of ways. One result of this has been that it has been quite common for people who want to attack the Federal Government to stereotype such matters as another Canberra grab. Indeed, in my own seat of Richmond, State National Party members seek to cover the gross mistakes of the Greiner-Murray Government that have been made through its railway cuts to the north coast services by playing that game. It is a dishonest and shameless tactic. </PARA>
<PARA> Government revenue from taxes on petroleum are derived from two sources: excise and royalties on crude oil, and excise on petrol. The honourable member for Burke most clearly explained the comparison of prices in Australia with other countries and its implications for the Australian consumer. It is important tounderstand two matters in relation to these taxes. Firstly, the tax on crude oil is paid by producers, not by consumers. Hence, the remarks by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in concluding his statement to the House I feel are completely incorrect and he needs to take this on board. I will say it again for his benefit: the tax on crude oil is paid by producers and not by consumers. Secondly, the petrol excise is a volume based excise and therefore has not increased one cent as a result of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to note that the total petroleum tax regime of $7.6 billion as a proportion of total Budget revenue is the lowest of any year in the last decade, despite the perception fostered dishonestly in some quarters that Australia's rate of petroleum product excise is high. It is in fact the second lowest of the 20 International Energy Agency countries. Only the United States of America has a lower rate of product tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government's excise on petrol is one of the lowest taxes on petrol among the 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries. Total petroleum taxation on crude oil and petroleum products as a proportion of total taxation has declined since the early 1980s to its lowest proportion in the decade-from 12.5 per cent in 1983-84 to 7.6 per cent in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> While excise on petroleum fuels has increased over this period, having been indexed since 1983, the petrol price rise over the past decade has until now been lower than inflation. The public concern about high petroleum prices is understandable because transport plays such a major role in our everyday lives in Australia-perhaps more so than in other countries. But in Australia we are still comparatively well off. We have the third cheapest petrol among OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The perception has been fostered by some that the Government is making a windfall gain from higher crude oil prices. There can be little doubt that increases in government revenue as a result of increasing crude oil prices may well be a short term situation. Prices declined in early October as assessments of the Middle East situation fluctuated. It may well be that, by the end of the fiscal year, depending on how the Middle East situation develops, the average price of crude oil for the year could be such that there are no significant gains in revenue. Any government revenue gains from the crude oil excise have to be put in the perspective of the $755m estimated revenue forgone over this and the next fiscal year resulting from the change to a resource rent tax to apply to oil from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary producers on the north coast of New South Wales, in the electorates of Richmond, Page and Cowper, as well as primary producers in the rest of Australia, know that this year the Government will forgo revenue of $855m as a result of the diesel fuel rebate available to primary producers and off road users in the mining industry. In 1989-90, domestic demand for petroleum products averaged almost 39,000 megalitres in total. </PARA>
<PARA> Petroleum accounts for some 36 per cent of total energy demand. Other forms include natural gas at 17 per cent, black coal at 29 per cent and brown coal at 12 per cent. It is interesting to note that 68 per cent of petroleum is consumed in the transport sector. In June 1990 crude oil, condensate, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas were being produced from 174 separate producing areas in this country. At present we are technically self-sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> One spin-off of the present perceptions about petroleum prices is that more and more people are beginning to question the tremendous waste of resources in this country. The previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor, questioned the necessity of using the consumer price index (CPI) to raise excise. The honourable member for O'Connor needs to take on board the fact that the CPI rises are there to ensure the responsible use of the resource so that the economy does not squander a non-renewable and precious resource. It is the only way of ensuring some responsible use by the economy and by consumers. It would be ridiculous to have a situation where we were consuming this non-renewable resource at such a rate that we could not replace our use with some other type of energy, whether it be through technology or some other change. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Burke has addressed this issue in an article in the Australian Municipal Journal in its August volume. He rightly argues:</PARA>
<PARA>We must rebel against the crazy notion that it is sensible to have 2,000 trucks a night running up and down the Hume Highway parallel to the standard gauge railway, or to have 1,000 trucks a night running up and down the Western Highway between Melbourne and Adelaide parallel to the railway . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I add that trucks run up and down the Pacific Highway through my electorate and that of my colleagues the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this issue because there has been a concerted campaign based around the distorted view that somehow the Federal Government has got hold of money raised from petrol excise and will not return it to be spent on roads. The honourable member for Burke informs us in his article that direct and indirect costs associated with this madness cost the nation $10 billion each year. The honourable member commented:</PARA>
<PARA>That's a hell of a lot more than the Federal Government raises in petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, this nation cannot go on indulging itself in such folly, no matter how much the automobile associations go on peddling the nonsense that more petrol tax needs to be spent on roads. I respectfully commend the article to honourable members for their education and reflection. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let us hope that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) prevails in his negotiations with the States to end the disjointed, piecemeal and inefficient railway systems in Australia which have encouraged so much needless traffic on to the road system, with such great and unnecessary cost to this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990 seeks to amend the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 and consequentially provides a minor change to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. On 1 January 1988 the Australian oil market was deregulated. As a consequence, the import parity pricing as a basis for levying excise was terminated and excise was calculated on the prices achieved in the free market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Petroleum Excise (Prices) Act 1987 instituted a new method of determining crude oil prices for the purpose of levying excise, based on the volume weighted average of realised prices of sales of crude oil-the volware price-over the calendar month. The Act was introduced specifically to deal with Bass Strait, with the price basis for levying excise from other oil producing fields to be determined when production from these fields exceeded the 30 million barrel threshold. Indications are that cumulative production from the Jackson oilfield, which is in my electorate of Maranoa, will exceed 30 million barrels early in 1990-91 and therefore production above this limit will become excisable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to widen the definition of producer in the principal Act to include onshore producers. Amendments are also required to enable the calculation of a separate volware price description of each producing region to be prescribed in the regulations to the Act. The amendments that are proposed will be good if it means that we will have a more level playing field. A tariff of any description would apply unfair competition against one producing region over another. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a need for the Government to offset the windfall gains which it is currently making through the crude oil levy, brought about primarily by the crisis in the Middle East. I suggest to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) that we should be reducing the excise tax on refined petrol and diesel. Clearly, the failure of the Government to offer relief to users of fuel renders this Labor Government guilty of profiting from the threat of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members some idea of the extent of the windfall gains that are currently being made by the Government. A Senate Estimates committee has confirmed that for every $US1 increase in the price of crude oil the Government stands to gain about $60m in a full year. With the current price of oil hovering around $40 a barrel, this equates to a windfall in a full year of between $1 billion and $1.25 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard the argument that we have some of the cheapest fuel and energy in the world, but I took out some figures on comparative fuel prices and I should like to bring these to the notice of the House. In early August this year in the United States of America people were paying 28.6 cents a litre for their fuel, in Australia 61.7 cents a litre, and in Japan $1.03. In America the price is now 34.6 cents a litre. There has been an increase of 20.9 per cent, brought about largely because of the price of oil rising from the Middle East. Japan has had a 6.8 percentage point increase since the Middle East crisis, and Australia has had the highest increase-28.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the tax component that makes up the price of fuel to these users, Australia is very similar to Japan. We have a 46 per cent tax take from the price of fuel; that is what the Government raises in revenue out of every litre of fuel. The United States has 30 per cent. So the Government is placing a very heavy burden on some sections of the community because of the threat of a conflict in the Middle East, and that burden is being unfairly shared by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look a little more closely at Japan. Japan certainly depends on the Middle East for more than 80 per cent of its crude oil, and it lost 14 per cent of its supply when it imposed economic sanctions on Iraq because of Iraq entering Kuwait. So a nation that is dependent on the Middle East and particularly Iraq for its oil has had a 6.8 percentage point increase since the threat of conflict began, yet we have had a 28.2 per cent increase. Clearly, this Federal Labor Government is ripping off the system and it needs to address that very clearly. Looking at the United States, a country which has similar production costs to those of Australia, the only difference is in the level of government revenue extracted. As I said, America extracts 30 per cent in tax from the price of every litre of fuel, Australia 46 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We can see quite clearly from those comparisons with other nations-one dependent on oil imports, the other basically self-sufficient-that Australia, which is also basically self-sufficient, has an economy that is very heavily reliant upon revenues not just from the Australian oil industry but also from users of fuel, be they primary producers, miners or a person running the family car. </PARA>
<PARA> All these tax components of our fuel price are very inflationary. To reduce the fuel excise at the petrol pump by the amount of that windfall gain would in fact be a very positive way of assisting in controlling our inflation. The price of oil, the price of energy, is very inflationary. As the price rises it will cost more to produce goods; it will cost more to mine coal; it will cost more to farm. Everything is driven by fuel. Clearly, if the Government misses the point on this one, it is failing in its duty to try to bring the economy under control. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly what I see is that the big users now are the big losers. Let me give the House an example of some of the big losers in my electorate of Maranoa. The Blackwater-Emerald area has one of the richest coalmining areas in Australia, the Bowen Basin. A typical mine in that area would be using-and I have checked these figures-half a million litres of diesel per month. </PARA>
<PARA> One does not have to be much of an economist to work out just how much extra that is adding to the cost of producing their coal, which is an export industry. If we are to get this country out of its economic problems, we have to make our exports more competitive. By not addressing this problem, we are driving up the costs of production of our export industries, which are so vital to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you have coalmines in your electorate. Those mines would be suffering the same sorts of cost increases, which are an impost on them brought about by the threat of war in the Middle East. That is why I claim that this Labor Government is war profiteering out of the threat of the Middle East crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that is being hit very unfairly is local government. I have representatives of local government ringing me almost daily in Maranoa. Out there one of the primary functions of local government is the maintenance and building of roads. Of course, the further west one goes the greater the length of roads for which local governments are responsible. One shire alone in my electorate, near Dalby, is a very large user of fuel, as indeed they all are. They use bulldozers and graders to develop the roads and to extract gravel to lay the road surfaces. If the price of oil stays at $40 a barrel, it is going to cost that one shire alone an extra $100,000 on its budget-an increase of 10 per cent, which means that the shire is going to have to increase its rates another 10 per cent to raise that money-and that is in only one shire. </PARA>
<PARA> The local government area is being hit, and that means a tax on the ratepayers of that shire. It is not just one shire that is involved, it is all shires, all local authorities; they are all big users of fuel. Of course, they are also big payers of tax when it comes to this Middle East crisis. That is why I believe that the windfall gains this Government is making as a result of the Middle East crisis must be used to offset the price of fuel. We are hitting the big users more than the small users, and the big users are in fact the big losers. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter the Government should be looking at is the distinction between the people who use petrol and those to whom diesel exemptions apply. I have people in my area who are about to start harvesting. Many of them have auto headers which have been giving very good service for 10 and 20 years. They are still doing good service but they are driven by a petrol engine as opposed to a diesel engine. We have the ridiculous situation now where if a person has a petrol-driven header or a petrol-driven tractor in a small crop area, he cannot claim an exemption for that use, but if he happens to have a diesel-driven machine he can. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a ridiculous situation when he can claim exemption for the fuel for the diesel header going down one side of the paddock but not for the petrol-driven one on the other side, purely because it is driven by petrol. I should like the Government to look once again at the area of exemptions. If the use is in the area of primary industry or mining, it is a productive sector. As the tax applies now it is a tax on production; it is a tax on our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the mines in the Blackwater-Emerald area are using petrol-driven vehicles to run around the mines area, not on the roads. They find that the capital cost of buying a petrol utility or a small four-wheel-drive is cheaper than that of a diesel-driven one, but they cannot claim the exemption for that petrol-driven vehicle, although they can for the diesel. What a crazy situation. It is quite discriminatory. If it is good enough for the diesel-driven machine, it should be good enough for the petrol-driven machine. I hope that the Government will look at this area and eliminate that distortion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have outlined, coal mines, local governments, primary industry groups, transport operators and bus operators are being taxed very heavily and are paying the cost of this Middle East conflict more heavily than other sections of the community. We have not heard yet whether 1c more will be spent on roads as a result of this windfall gain. Honourable members should bear in mind that in a 12-month period, if prices stay where they are, this Government will receive in excess of $1 billion in extra income. We have not heard where the Government will spend it. I challenge those in the Government, if they are not going to reduce the price of fuel, to announce that they will spend more on our roads. We have not heard yet whether they will. Coming by taxes by default seems to be just another way of being a high-taxing government. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments in the Bill before us certainly will address some areas and will bring about a much more level playing field in the Jackson oilfield, which is in my area, in the electorate of Maranoa-which has very few amenities and certainly does not have any bitumen roads. But, via the crude oil levy, the Government will gain a lot of revenue from this resource as it comes out of the ground. I suggest that the Government should look at returning some of this money to the people who are so desperately in need, and it should look at the area of roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a windfall gain on its hands. It should look further at amending the fuel excise tax on refined petrol and freezing the automatic indexation of fuel tax. While we have automatic indexation we are fuelling inflation. One feeds on the other. It is like a dog chasing its tail; the dog will never catch it. I urge the Minister to look at this matter very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government must also look at reducing its dependence and reliance on the oil industry for a quick buck. That is what it is doing right now. Mr Deputy Speaker, your electorate would be affected in many ways, just as mine is, because you have coalminers, truck operators and primary producers in your electorate. Believe me, they are hurting. This revenue could very well go back to the people. People are paying it in a disproportionate manner. As I said, the largest users are the biggest losers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 proposes three changes to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 as it affects crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). First, the volware excise adjustment will allow in effect for a taxation regime in the form of a specific crude oil excise rate to be applied to the varying regions of the Bass Strait oil province. Secondly, the excise in the routine biannual LPG excise adjustment is calculated as 60 per cent of the amount by which the realised price for naturally occurring LPG exceeds $147 per tonne. The realised price is the weighted average of import and export prices of LPG over the preceding six months. Thirdly, there is a `new oil', `old oil' retrospective adjustment to the tax liabilities of the joint producers, Esso and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, with regard to excise payments they have made from the Tuna oilfield. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Fischer) has concentrated very heavily on this very worrying aspect of the legislation before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with considerable irony that I stand before the House today to comment on the pricing policy for LPG. I have stood here on numerous occasions in the past and have called on the Government-in the interests of consumers and industry development and in the name of implementing a rationally conceived energy policy-to deregulate the price of LPG. On every occasion I have spoken on this matter, together with my colleagues, I have been subject to the criticism of various Government members-many of whom, incidentally, have strangely failed to reappear in the House following the last election. Foremost amongst those attackers of the coalition's policy of deregulation of LPG was the former member for Bendigo, Mr John Brumby. It is in the interests of the people of Bendigo that they have replaced Mr Brumby with a very energetic and vigorous fighter on their behalf, Mr Bruce Reid, who embraces the policy of deregulation of LPG which the Government has very belatedly come to accept. Still, we should not worry too much about John Brumby, the defeated member for Bendigo. He has landed on his feet. He has a Government job. </PARA>

I notice that Mr Brumby is attached to the office of his very good friend the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). We must bear in mind that the Minister for Resources and the former member for Bendigo were quite inseparable after they both entered this Parliament at the same time as I did following the March 1983 election. They were known as the Bib and Bub of Parliament House. Now, in true adherence to the concept of mateship of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Brumby's old mate has given him a job. The Minister for Resources has just entered the chamber. Perhaps he can tell us what Mr John Brumby, the defeated member for Bendigo, brings to his consultancy.

<PARA> Deregulation has struck fear into the hearts of those in the Labor Party ever since it assumed office. In the summer of 1989 the former Minister for Resources, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), ran a media campaign against the coalition's policy of deregulating the price of LPG. It constituted a shabby display of populist nonsense and reflected very poorly on his perspective of his nationally important portfolio. In the Senate on 7 December of 1988, as well as in a press release later on that day, the former Minister for Resources said that the coalition's deregulatory approach to LPG was a threat to consumers, was totally irresponsible and would threaten supplies to the domestic market. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XH4">Mr McGAURAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. This Government's adherence to a deeply regulated system of supply and pricing of LPG has hindered the interests of consumers. Having said all that in 1988 and then in 1989, the Government has done an about-face and has now lurched very belatedly into deregulation of the wholesale market for LPG. Having accepted the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) to deregulate the wholesale price of LPG, the Government, as of 1 January 1991, will now require only a modest surveillance role for the Authority. The marketplace will now be the price setter for LPG-as it always would have been under the coalition's resources and energy policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's past regulatory policies in this regard always were a shambles. They were driven by political necessity and nothing else. The Government has to understand that it requires political courage to change some of the most fundamental aspects of the workings of our economy-whether on the waterfront, coastal shipping, telecommunications, aviation or resources and energy policy areas. The Government has to bite the bullet. Now it has done so in regard to LPG, many years after the coalition first advocated it. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Government, through its political cowardice, failed to make the necessary changes, it severely hampered the development of the industry and prejudiced the long term interests of consumers. Even the Chairman of the PSA, Professor Alan Fells, came to recognise that the Government's price setting arrangements were hopelessly ill-matched to the needs of consumers and industry. Professor Fells now tells us that deregulation will mean more investment and a better infrastructure for an industry which has suffered from controls inhibiting investment but still having little effect on prices. I do not know how many times members of the Liberal and National parties have given the Government that message. The Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics forecasts that for 1989-90 Australia will earn $208m in revenue from exports of LPG. This represents sales volumes of 2,100 megalitres, which is half the total annual production of naturally occurring LPG. Despite the importance of this resource, not just for its growing export earnings but also for its crucial domestic role, the Government's regulatory approach has undoubtedly stunted its development. The Government's approach to LPG is characteristic of its failure to act on micro-economic reform at any level of significance. The pricing structure for LPG has been anything other than transparent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since February 1989 the PSA has been given the responsibility of establishing the maximum endorsed price for LPG. In order to fix this price at what it deemed to be the appropriate level, the PSA devised a pricing formula which calculated the maximum wholesale price at a level linked to the cost of importing LPG from abroad. The pricing formula, which sets the notional import price for LPG, takes into account movements in the shipping costs of LPG as well as the Saudi benchmark price. It was never a formula which could be appropriately designed to respond in any meaningful way to the circumstances of the domestic environment. On 1 January next year, the Government will embrace the coalition's pricing policy in this respect and deregulate the wholesale market. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the public has now more than ever before taken a very keen interest in the domestic pricing of LPG. Despite conversion kits for motor cars being at around $1,400 to $1,600 a unit, suppliers can no longer keep up with demand. Notwithstanding this, if the Government had not accepted the PSA's own recommendations for deregulating the LPG market, the supply of LPG into the future would have been highly questionable-and the Minister for Resources agrees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Bennelong many times urged the Government to deregulate LPG in the face of a populist, propaganda war whipped up amongst local government bodies-particularly in New South Wales-and many pensioners. The Government's regulatory approach to the pricing of LPG has crippled industry investment in LPG supply infrastructure. It has therefore distorted the balanced development of the resource itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It needs to be recognised that the coalition has long stood by a policy in which Australia's pricing of LPG must correspond to import parity prices. It has done so against the scare campaign waged by the Government's former Minister for Resources, Senator Cook. The industry, as well as consumers, will long bear the scars of the Government's intransigence on this issue. The coalition's policy would have effectively removed the wholesale price setting role of the PSA years ago. But it is only this year under the new Minister for Resources that the Government has finally decided that it just might, for once, put the interests of Australia and consumers ahead of its own strategic political interests, that it might put the interests of consumers ahead of party policy. If only it could bring this same enlightenment-however late, it is to be welcomed-to other areas of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that Australia must trade in the international market, structural adjustments to the economy which mirror the deregulatory approach to LPG are critical to our competitiveness. As LPG is, after all, an internationally traded commodity, it is vital that the price mechanism affecting LPG reflects the competitiveness of overseas trading partners. Not only would this result in the rational allocation of the resource itself, but would also ensure greater market predictability for producers and consolidate the role of LPG as an important energy source. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be remembered in this context that past regulation of LPG severely inhibited the development of the domestic market for LPG. It is only since the emergence of a partially deregulated wholesale market that many of the distribution-cum-infrastructure problems have been overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, the recent construction of the Hastings terminal by Esso, which became operational in June, will serve to overcome the supply shortages which have adversely affected the consumers in the past. The Hastings terminal also assists greatly in meeting the excess demand for LPG in South Australia, which has resulted in shortages in that State over the past year. But in many States, such as New South Wales, difficulties have continued and will not change until the Government embraces full deregulation of the wholesale price of LPG. Instead of this, we have a tentative half-way stage, so characteristic of the Government's snail-like pace of reform; we only have partial deregulation of LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, the movement of LPG between States, which will become increasingly important as supplies decline in some areas, cannot effectively take place until the price mechanism assumes a measure of predictability. Given that there are ample domestic suppliers of LPG-some of which are reluctant to enter the market in any serious way owing to the current artificial pricing system-a deregulated wholesale market for LPG would be even more competitive than it is at present. The heightened competition allowed for under deregulation would serve to restrict any significant movements in the wholesale price. On this basis, full deregulation of the wholesale market is critical for the consolidation of LPG as a significant feature in Australia's energy mix. </PARA>
<PARA> As mentioned, the domestic shortages of LPG which have occurred in the past have been the result of the inadequate development of distribution facilities. This, as outlined previously, has been the result of a long history of regulation from which the industry is only just now beginning to emerge-and from which it would have emerged so much more rapidly under the coalition's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it ought to be remembered that the export market for LPG has played an important role in the development of the resource and, therefore, its availability on the domestic market. But this is a market that the Government has threatened with its use of export control powers to overcome domestic shortages. This is a prime example of the inconsistency of the Government's regulatory policies. </PARA>
<PARA> By failing to free up the market to enable development of the resource to its optimum level, the Government has had to meet the issue of supply and demand by way of threatened legislative sanction. It failed to recognise that a vigorous open market would enable investment to develop the resource to a point at which there would be the incentive to meet all demand. The export market, which the Government has ridiculed, has been critical to the industry. The Cooper Basin project would not have been viable if it had not been for the sale of contracted supplies into the international market. Exports by the Bass Strait producers, furthermore, have been important in providing valuable additional cash flows which have allowed for reinvestment in their other projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite this, it would be hoped that a deregulated environment would also bring further developments at the State level so as to consolidate further the market for LPG. Currently, the State of Victoria has limitations on the permissible mix of butane and propane in auto gas. Because of regulations such as this, most of Australia's butane is sold overseas. Recently, however, the fears about the volatility of such mixtures have dissipated. With the easing of State restrictions in this regard, the role of butane in the domestic market would be more likely to be developed, thereby widening the base for the supply of LPG. This would also have the effect of offsetting the anticipated increase in propane imports in coming years. In this regard it should also be remembered that if the domestic LPG industry is not developed, then future supplies of propane will have to be imported in greater amounts at obviously greater cost than currently forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> It has taken some years for the Government to face the facts on the nature of the LPG market. They were staring the Government in the face. Despite the urgings of the coalition parties, the Government has disregarded the need for deregulation from its coming to office in March 1983 until now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we come to the conclusion of this debate on the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1990 and the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill 1990, it is appropriate that I make some remarks about recent developments in the petroleum industry, particularly in relation to oil and petrol prices and the Government's taxation arrangements. As honourable members may be aware, it is only since the late 1960s that Australia has been a significant oil producer. Throughout most of the 1970s Australia was around 65 per cent self-sufficient. During the years of the Hawke Government, Australia has been around 80 per cent self-sufficient. Latest figures show that in 1989-90 Australia was 82 per cent self-sufficient in oil and in the first half of 1990 the rate was close to 90 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Australia did not have an oil industry, obviously we would be forced to import all our crude oil requirements. This would add billions of dollars to our trade deficit and mean higher interest rates and fewer jobs for Australians. In addition to substantially reducing our import bill, our high level of self-sufficiency also provides Australians with a secure domestic oil source. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of self-sufficiency, over recent years the Government has introduced a range of initiatives to encourage oil exploration and production. These measures include, for example, the deregulation of the crude oil market, relaxation of foreign investment rules, improvements in the availability of geological and geophysical data and a comprehensive program for releasing offshore oil exploration areas. More recently, in the 1990 Budget the Government, as honourable members will be aware, decided to extend the resource rent tax to maximise fully oil production in Bass Strait. </PARA>

<PARA>. . . at the end of the century and we look back, last night's Budget will be seen to be the decisive moment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a quite ringing endorsement, I would have thought, in anyone's terms. Despite the fact that exploration levels have recently hit record highs in terms of holes drilled and lines shot, the current rate of self-sufficiency is projected to decline through the 1990s as demand outstrips supply. Based on recent forecasts, for example by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, there is a 50 per cent chance that we will only be 50 per cent self-sufficient by the late 1990s. At current rates of production, current reserves of crude oil in condensate would last only another 11 1/2 years. So it is imperative that we promote and maintain a robust exploration and development program in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowing Australian oil prices to move in line with international oil prices helps to maintain Australia's attractiveness, both for exploration and development, with the ensuing increased potential for the discovery of more oil. The benefits of a secure domestic oil source are nowhere more evident than in the current climate. </PARA>
<PARA> A related question which is frequently raised in relation to oil and petrol prices is why, if Australia is relatively self-sufficient, do we have to follow international oil prices? The simple answer to that question is that oil is an internationally traded commodity and it would be counterproductive for Australia to attempt to insulate itself from price changes in the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> Any attempt to artificially hold down the price of Australian crude oil in order to prevent increases being passed on to the consumer would have a number of serious adverse consequences. Firstly, it would discourage investment in oil exploration and development in Australia with serious longer term consequences for our ability to supply our own needs. Secondly, it would reduce the incentive to conserve fuel, leading to increased rates of depletion of what is, by definition, a scarce resource. Thirdly, it would induce Australian producers to increase oil exports rather than supply the domestic market in order to take advantage of the higher international prices. </PARA>
<PARA> As Minister for Resources I am of course aware of consumer concerns about the increasing price of petrol which has resulted from the events in the Middle East. I am very sympathetic, I might say, to those concerns. But I must stress that the Government's policy settings are correct and are not about to be changed. Despite the present high level of petrol prices, Australia still has the second lowest level of product taxes in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the third lowest level of retail prices. In mid-September, when Australian consumers were paying about 76c per litre for petrol, our trading partners in the United Kingdom were paying $1.12; in West Germany, $1.10; France, $1.34; and in Italy, $1.62. </PARA>

Honourable members may also be interested to note that in the United States of America-the only country in the OECD with lower levels of product tax than Australia-President Bush recently announced a 10c per gallon increase in petrol tax. Honourable members will be aware that that is currently a matter of some debate in the United States Congress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This brings me to the question of Australian Government taxes on oil and petrol. In broad terms, Government revenue from taxes on petroleum is derived from two sources-from excise through the resource rent tax and royalties on crude oil, and from the excise on petroleum. Budget estimates for the 1990-91 financial year show that taxation of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas-the latter negligible-is expected to raise $1.5 billion whilst the petroleum product excise-primarily petrol-is expected to raise $6.1 billion. The total petroleum tax take-that is, $7.6 billion-as a proportion of total Budget revenue is the lowest of any year in the past decade. When considering these taxes, it is important to bear in mind two key points: firstly, the tax on crude oil is paid by producers, not consumers; and secondly, the petrol excise, currently 24.9c per litre, is a volume based excise and therefore has not increased one cent as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to government taxation on oil, the Budget estimate for 1990-91, as I have said, is that the Government should receive about $1.5 billion in receipts from crude oil excise, resource rent tax and royalties. This forecast was based on a crude oil price of $US23 per barrel. For every $US1 per barrel by which the average price of oil exceeds the Budget estimates for 1990-91, it is estimated that the Government will receive in the order of $A70m gross in additional revenue. However, after allowing for the deductability of secondary taxes including the resource rent tax for company taxation purposes, the actual net return to the Government is closer to $43m. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated earlier, it is important to note that the level of government revenue from crude oil does not affect the price of petrol. This is because crude oil taxes are paid by producers, not consumers, and if the Government were to remove all taxation from crude oil, the price of crude oil would remain the same and petrol prices would not change. In relation to government taxation of petrol it needs to be stressed that the product excise is volume and not price based. Thus the current rate of 24.9c per litre has not changed as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis. Moreover, as I indicated earlier, Australia's rate of petroleum product taxation is in fact the second lowest of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. </PARA>
<PARA> With these facts in mind, let me respond to the claims which have been made by motoring organisations and others that the Government is profiteering from higher oil and petrol prices. I must say that I have been amazed at some of the outlandish claims in relation to alleged profiteering and windfall gains. Some of these, which have suggested that the Government stands to collect billions of dollars more as a result of higher prices, are so far wide of the mark as to be farcical. </PARA>

As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) indicated two weeks ago in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, for every US dollar that the international price of oil exceeds the Budget estimate of $US23 per barrel, the Government stands to gain an extra $70m on a full year basis. This, though, is the gross return to the Government. As I said earlier, after allowing for the company wide deductability of resource rent tax, the net return to the Government is some $43m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thus, if the world price of oil averages, for example, $US30 per barrel over the course of the financial year 1990-91, the net `windfall' to the Government would be in the order of $301m; that is, seven multiplied by the net figure of $43m. </PARA>

But it is also important to note that there is another side to the equation.

If such a trend continued throughout the course of the year-and I am not saying it will; I believe it is too early to make that judgment, but for indicative reasons if we assume that it does-the Government would actually forgo revenue of $600m from the petrol excise; that is, 10 per cent of the $6 billion revenue in the Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, far from the Government profiteering from higher oil and petrol prices, it may well be that the overall effect on government revenues from higher prices will in fact be negative. This outcome is not inconsistent with the views recently expressed by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)-not someone from this side of the House, but the Leader of the Opposition-who recently questioned claims about possible government `windfalls' and stated, `I'm not clear in my own mind that the net effect on the Budget is positive'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is very true, but I make the obvious point. The honourable member for Farrer's colleague the honourable member for Maranoa talked absurdly about `war profiteering', attempting to instil in his constituents and people who are suffering from these higher prices-and we all agree that they are-a view that it is the Government accepting a huge windfall. That is not a position endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for Maranoa is a relatively new member, but he will find that in this place that sort of crude politicking will come back to haunt him. If, on every occasion on which he asserts, using the emotive term `war profiteering', that the Government is profiteering from these changes, he fails to assert that the Leader of the Opposition-his leader-does not hold that view, he will, of course, by definition be misleading his constituents. We hope the honourable member will not embark upon that course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope my colleagues in this debate have clarified the position in relation to oil and petrol prices. The only panacea for high petrol prices is a resolution of the conflict in the Middle East. I think we would all agree with that proposition. Australia is a low taxing country by international standards and it has the second lowest level of product taxes and the third lowest retail prices in the OECD. While higher international oil prices may result in government oil revenues being higher than estimated, it is also likely that government revenues from petrol excise will be somewhat lower than estimated. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments to the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill give thrust to the implementation of the coalition's long-held position that this legislation should be prospective and not retrospective. The first dimension of these amendments relates to the excise aspects and the trigger of 30 million barrels in respect of Jackson and perhaps other fields in the future-and let us hope that there are other fields in the future that will attract these trigger mechanisms. I will not dwell unduly on that matter and I refer honourable members to my remarks in the second reading stage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The second dimension of this block of amendments is very much about the correct procedure which should apply in respect of this long-running saga of `old' and `new' oil. I would like to make the following additional points. Just prior to 1980, as part of development drilling in the Tuna field, the Tuna L was discovered, and a letter to the Department of National Development and Energy by Esso Australia, on behalf of the joint venturers at that time, sought a declaration that, in fact, that oil was `new' oil. The company laid out its position at that time and at many subsequent times since that date in 1980, although obviously the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) will make the point that it was not until March 1990 that the companies commenced formal protest; but they are on the record as saying that they took the view then that that was `new' oil. Subsequently, at every stage they have taken that view. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal situation changed in 1984, and this legislation relates to the situation pertaining merely since this Government has been in power and has attempted to bed down the definition of `new' and `old' oil. So the previous period is, to some extent, now beyond the reach of the Parliament in terms of this legislation because this Bill relates to the period from 1 July 1984 onwards. We seek to say that one does not change the rules of the game, in terms of changing this legislation, while the matter is part heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that, in fact, that process should be allowed to run its course. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the claims lodged by the companies relate only to a 12-month period from March 1989 to March 1990 and a subsequent period from March 1990 which, as the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has further indicated again today, will be eclipsed once we come to 1 July 1990 and the Budget resource rental tax (RRT) measures with respect to the Bass Strait apply. That was the claim that was lodged and it was rejected by the Collector of Customs at the time; the claim lodged merely related to, in effect, a 16-month period, not a longer period. That has some significance and part of the reason for that relates to section 53 (2) of the excise regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that this is a very complex area. The RRT moves will be, in one sense, an attempt to simplify this complex area of legislation. The Minister for Resources, in giving his figures, said that the net windfall might be only around $301m. I make the point, in passing, that accounted into that figure are the Budget RRT provisions and the impact that they will have on this year's Budget and next year's Budget. He does that ahead of the actual legislation passing through the Parliament. It ought to be spelt out to what extent that net windfall figure of perhaps $301m is relevant if one were to take out the RRT dimension embraced in those complex calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to the Minister for Resources, I must say that we on this side of the House have been very careful to spell out that it is a question of arriving at what the ultimate windfall might be in respect of the Middle East situation and addressing it in that context. We recognise that there are wins and losses for the government of the day in these types of situations. We also recognise that there is an horrific impact, particularly on provincial Australia-not just on small business and primary producers-as a result of these increases in crude oil and petrol prices. There is also an impact on retired people and many others, because so many people-especially those who live beyond our capital cities but even people who live in large sections of capital cities-have no access to public transport and are hit hard by these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister's comment in relation to the amendments. We have made an honest endeavour to see consistent laws apply in this circumstance and to see that, in fact, the retrospectivity-because it is clearly retrospective; surely the Minister cannot argue with that-is eliminated from this part of this cognate legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, the Government opposes and cannot accept the two amendments moved by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), on behalf of the coalition because the retrospective commencement dates proposed by the volware amendment in paragraph 3(c) of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and clause 3 of the Petroleum Excise (Prices) Amendment Bill and the `new' oil definition amendments in paragraphs 3 (a) and (d) of the Excise Bill are, in the Government's view, quite justifiable and will not prejudice or unfairly affect any person's rights or legitimate expectations. I would like to deal with the volware amendments first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The volware amendments in the petroleum and the excise tariff Bills are proposed to be given retrospective operation to the commencement of the volware scheme on 1 January 1988 for very sensible drafting reasons. The volware amendments, as noted in my second reading speech, will have the effect of requiring excise to be paid on oil obtained from different oil-producing regions on the basis of the volware price determined for that particular region. At present, the Bass Strait oil-producing region is the only oil-producing region for which a volware price may be determined. The original volware scheme, as drafted, did not differentiate between oil-producing regions, yet as stated in the second reading speech in 1987 introducing the volware scheme, the price basis for excising other oil production would be considered at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the volware amendments contained in the Bills, advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel suggested making the volware amendments retrospective in order to, in effect, obviate the need to remake regulations prescribing the volware pricing regime for the Bass Strait oil-producing region and in order to obviate the need to draft extensive savings provisions into the two Bills to preserve the current unitary pricing regime in respect of the Bass Strait region. A copy of the memorandum from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to this effect was provided to the honourable member for Farrer. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Rather than creating 2 different pricing regimes, in form if not in substance, that is to say, a unitary regime until the Jackson field reaches 30M barrels and a divided regime thereafter (with appropriate preservation of the unitary regime in respect of oil entered for home consumption before Jackson oil becomes dutiable) it seems preferable to back date all amendments of the VOLWARE scheme to the commencement of that scheme. This will allow Bass Strait to be treated simply as the first ``field'' to which the VOLWARE pricing regime applies but the manner of its treatment will not change at any time from 1 January 1988 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA>In no way, however, can the backdating adversely affect a person's rights in the sense that any new oil-producing region for which it may be wished that a Volware price be determined can have only prospective effect, for the simple reason that regulations, which are the mechanism for prescribing Volware prices, cannot operate retrospectively where the regulations would adversely affect a person's rights. Therefore, the Government rejects the Opposition's argument that the backdating of the Volware amendments is inappropriate and it does not agree with the Opposition's proposed amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the more substantial effect of the Opposition's amendments, and that is the new oil-old oil debate. The new oil definition amendments are proposed to be retrospective to 1 July 1984 for the detailed reasons noted in my second reading speech on this Bill. The honourable member for Farrer would have us believe that the Government's amendments in this regard are unfair because they remove what he alleges is a legitimate right, a legitimate expectation actually, of the two oil producers concerned to a refund on excise duty technically overpaid since 1 July 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are quite different. The Government of the day, sitting in opposition now, considered in January 1980 an application for new oil status from Esso and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) in respect of oil discovered while drilling two particular wells from the Tuna platform in the Tuna field in Bass Strait. New oil status for the purposes of the excise regime effectively results in a lower excise rate being applied to oil production from the particular area concerned. The application was refused in August 1980 by the Opposition's then Minister for Resources and Energy on the basis that the new oil arrangements at the time precluded any oil discovered while drilling a development well. Therefore, production from the two Tuna reservoirs was effectively excisable at the higher old oil rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the new oil excise arrangements were proposed for amendment so that oil discovered from development wells-as distinct from exploratory wells-would be eligible for the lower new oil rate; but the intention was to retain the effect of all classifications made prior to that date. This intention was made quite clear in the press release of the then Minister for resources on 30 June 1983. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>``New'' oil applications that had not yet been determined would also be considered against the amended guidelines but previous decisions would not be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the amendments made to the Excise Tariff Act by Act No. 131 of 1984, which were intended to give effect to the stated policy that decisions on new oil applications made prior to 1 July 1983 would not be reviewable under the new arrangements, have only since March of this year been effectively challenged, a challenge which it is now admitted may succeed without this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The question quite clearly becomes, in making the correction proposed to restore the legal status quo, whether the Government is unfairly removing a legitimate right, a legitimate expectation, of the two producers concerned. Contrary to what the coalition would have us believe, Esso and BHP accepted the 1980 decision refusing its new oil application in respect of the Tuna reserves and the non-reviewable status of the pre-July 1983 classification arrangements-when the new oil amendments were announced in June 1983-without legal protest, which was always open to them under the duty payment-under-protest provisions of the Excise Tariff Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Esso and BHP accepted the 1980 decision and paid excise on production from the Tuna reservoir at the old oil rate without protest until 1 March 1990. Presumably, all their production decisions were made on that assumption.  For that reason, any changes made now to the new oil definition that have the effect of ensuring that the Tuna oil continues to be treated as old oil should be seen as declaratory in nature. That is, the changes will only put into law what the industry-I repeat, the industry-and the Government had always expected to have been applied. They will maintain the accepted excise status quo in order to protect the revenue, in order to ratify what the industry and the Government-this Government and our predecessor-have always expected to have been the legal position, and in order not to provide an unintended and unexpected windfall to the two producers. This Government considers that the retrospective commencement proposed by the Bills is quite justifiable in the circumstances. The retrospectivity will not involve extra duty payments from the producers. The producers have made the payments. They have made those payments since 1980 to acquit their legal liabilities. They have done so without availing themselves of the facility in the legislation to protest that liability until March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Having uncovered a technical loophole in the legislation, the coalition would have the Government accept the proposition that rather than completely correct the anomaly, the Government should pay the producers $30m, as the honourable member for Farrer says-but, in fact, admit a contingent liability of an additional $170m; a total of $200m-simply because the producers have had the good fortune of recently uncovering something which, by their actions for the last nine years, they have realised was never intended by the Government of the day. The Government is taking the sensible and quite justifiable position of correcting, as soon as is legislatively possible, a legislative anomaly which neither it nor the producers thought existed until the middle of this year. Therefore, the Government rejects both the coalition's amendments in this regard, and the rationale behind them. </PARA>

As I said in my more fulsome rebuttal of the Opposition's amendments, the fact is that the joint venturers-Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and Esso-had paid the excise for 10 years. At that time they had the opportunity to challenge that legislation, but they did not challenge the legislation. That is not only the legislation of this Government, but also that of the previous Government about whether the field was new oil or old oil. In effect, because they have found a technical loophole, the Opposition says, `Fine, pay the sharp lawyers big fees and give away $200m'. The Government rejects that.

<PARA>These amendments are consistent with our approach, which we have already referred to in the second reading debate, and relate to the nature of the drafting of both pieces of related legislation. I will not detain the Committee further, other than to say that the only answer the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) gave in respect of these amendments in the previous debate was that it would require an administrative dimension and additional gazettal publication. The Minister also referred to part of a memorandum in relation to this. Nevertheless, this no field position has triggered this mechanism and this Parliament is now legislating retrospectively to cover the period since 1 January 1988. In fact, the actual tax to be paid arising from this legislation will be from some date in the future-from 1990 onwards. We seem to be dancing to a drafting nicety and in the process eclipsing the will of the Parliament in a matter of this kind whereby unnecessary legislation has been put down, as the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and others have pointed out. It is for these reasons that I have moved these amendments. As a matter of the courtesy to the Committee, I advise that we will not be calling for a division on the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Prime Minister and I refer him to the fact that Australia has not been included in an important regional meeting between President Bush and 13 heads of government from Pacific island states to be held in Honolulu on 27 October. In noting that this is the first such meeting of its kind, and a most welcome one, I ask the Prime Minister: can he explain why a country of Australia's size and traditional influence has been excluded from such an important regional meeting? Does he believe that the meeting signals both an increased United States interest in further expanding its bilateral relations with Pacific island states and an increasing US reluctance to continue to rely on Australian diplomatic resources in the region to the extent that it has in the past? Does the high profile American initiative involving the President reflect a growing lack of confidence in Australia's role and influence with Pacific island governments? Finally, is it an attempt by the US Administration to pick up the pieces after the Prime Minister's disastrous performance at the recent South Pacific Forum meeting, including his Government's inept handling of its relations with Fiji which have such important regional implications?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition was laughing at himself as he was reading that question out. Of all his forays into international affairs, which have been consistently marked by his ineptitude, this must get the blue ribbon prize. The answer to this question is that the initiative by the United States in this regard represents the culmination of a thrust that we have been putting to the United States Administration for some years; that is, we have been saying, `It would make a lot of sense if you just did not leave this area to Australia and to New Zealand'. We have carried the thrust of our alliance relationship policies in the South Pacific for a very long period. Going back to the time when my good friend George Shultz--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Going back to the time when my good friend George Shultz was Secretary of State, I have been pressing upon the United States Administration that it should in fact take a more direct role in meeting with these countries of the South Pacific. I am pleased to say that over a period of time it has increased its contact with these nations of the South Pacific Forum. Indeed, what has been done now by the President of the United States represents, as I have said, a culmination of what we from Australia have been pressing upon the United States Administration: `Don't leave the South Pacific to Australia'. Far from this representing some insult or rejection of Australia, the truth is that it represents the undertaking by the United States Administration of precisely the policy that we have been pressing upon it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable members want to have exposed for what it is worth this fatuity from the Leader of the Opposition, they may note that just last week my Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister for Defence were in Washington for the Ausmin talks. There, Senator Evans and Senator Ray met with their counterparts, Mr Baker and Mr Cheney. The official statements that came out of those direct talks between Australia and the United States, which said that relations between Australia and the United States were at the best level they have ever been, were reflected, of course, in the private conversations that also took place. Those private conversations were not only in the formal structure of the Ausmin talks but also involved private lunches and other discussions between the respective Ministers. The truth is, as has been said now by successive Presidents of the United States and by successive Secretaries of State, that there is no country with which the United States has a more effective or a warmer relationship than it has with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are the facts attested to by successive Presidents of the United States, successive Secretaries of State of the United States and successive Secretaries of Defense of the United States. Those statements of attitude by the United States are on the record and in that situation, for this pathetic Leader of the Opposition to suggest that when the United States takes an initiative urged upon it by the Australian Government to have separate meetings with the South Pacific island nations, that represents a rebuttal of Australia by the United States and some diminution in our relationship, is further proof positive of the fact that this Leader of the Opposition should stick to economics. He is pathetic there, but at least he has some knowledge. In the area of international relations, whenever he opens his mouth he puts his massive foot into it. He ought to stay out of it and leave it to people who at least know something about it.</PARA>

In doing so, he indicates-as in the area of foreign policy, so also in the area of social policy-that he suffers not so much from prejudice as from sheer ignorance. He shows, as we have seen again and again from the Opposition, an unwillingness to deal with the complexities of social policy or to take it seriously. After all, his predecessor found in the last days of the election campaign that it would suit him to go down to the Matthew Talbot Hostel, make an appearance and suggest that somehow it had a role in relation to welfare benefits-presumably to ingratiate himself with some of his own supporters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, of course, the reality is that social security is a complex system, and reforming social security involves more than throw away lines about being at the coal face. After all, could one expect-in the terms of the Leader of the Opposition-to achieve a complex reform such as that carried out last year in respect of retirement income policy where 100 per cent now of the income test-free area is tax free as well; where those free areas are automatically indexed in line with the consumer price index; where all age pensioners will be out of the tax system altogether fully integrating the tax system across to the social security system; and, more than that, linking social security policy across to wages policy in terms of a massive reform of superannuation? I mean, the massive increase of more than 20 per cent that the Treasurer referred to earlier in the week, in terms of our accumulation of funds in superannuation, directly relates to that reform and the security that people feel about their own retirement as the result of an integrated series of reforms.</PARA>
<PARA> If one went to the area of sole parents one would have to refer, for example, to the complex child support scheme where again social security, income security and taxation are linked so that in a unique system, child support is collected effectively by the taxation system and paid out by social security to provide the basis of income support to sole parents, where support from the Government in a sense can be built on top of that very important and complex social reform. The jobs, education and training scheme links social security across to labour market programs and ensures that the more disadvantaged sole parent has the opportunity to get a foot back onto the ladder of opportunity and return to the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> Before the election we heard of an active employment policy from the honourable member for Bradfield. It was scrapped by the Leader of the Opposition immediately he took over. He said, `Don't worry about that; leave it to the voluntary agencies. Don't worry about linking people in the social security system back to the labour market programs to ensure that those people are removed from an area of disadvantage so that they are able to support themselves'.</PARA>
<PARA> In the most recent Budget a comprehensive reform was announced, again to assist people with disabilities return from social security payments to participate in the mainstream of the community. We are talking about a fundamental attitude to people on the part of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to give him another bucket. I just make the observation that I would, with all the modesty which surrounds me, have a great deal of reluctance entering into some dissertation on the mysteries of the Holy Trinity, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Equally, I suggest that Archbishop Hollingworth should show a similar reluctance before entering into a dissertation on the mysteries of the unholy trinity of economic policy-monetary policy, fiscal policy and wages policy-because he does not understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me read what Bishop Hollingworth has had to say about this area which is as much a mystery to him as the Holy Trinity is to me. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, that is the hard issue, of course. Clearly, demand does have to be dampened down, restraints have to be applied to the economy and the way they have decided to do it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>the single way they have used is to try and do it by keeping interest rates high. That is a very blunt edged instrument and it is very hurtful to a lot of families who are on the margin.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Bishop Hollingworth said about the Government's economic policy. He referred to `the single way that they have used to restrain the economy'. With all the respect that I can summon for Bishop Hollingworth, he is talking nonsense. Not even the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer have said of the Government that the single instrument we have used is monetary policy. How can anyone who knows anything about the conduct of economic policy in this country say that the Government has used the single instrument of monetary policy?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind the House of the facts. I hope my friend Bishop Hollingworth will read what I have to say and realise that he is wrong. How can one say that we have used the single instrument of monetary policy? Let us look at what we have done in the area of fiscal policy-the tightest fiscal policy in the history of this country. It is the first time in history that a surplus has been produced. Those opposite were on the treasury bench for 30 years and did not look like producing a surplus. This Government has now produced four surpluses in a row.</PARA>
<PARA> We have reduced a situation where we had an enormous public sector borrowing requirement. We have put that into a surplus position, a turnaround of the best part of $28 billion to $30 billion. That has been done in a situation where taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) has not risen. There has been a massive reduction in outlays of four or five percentage points as a percentage of GDP. There have been four successive surpluses, the tightest fiscal policy on record-and the Bishop says that we are relying on monetary policy alone.</PARA>
<PARA> The other element of the unholy trinity is wages policy. As anyone who knows anything about economic policy would know, there is an extremely tight wages policy. The proof is that we have had a 10.1 per cent reduction in non-farm real unit labour costs. We have had a massive shift from wages to profits, which allowed the historically high levels of investment.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts, which are obvious to anyone who knows anything about the conduct of macro-economic policy, are that this Government has had the tightest fiscal policy on record and the tightest wages policy. Yet the Bishop has said that the single way in which the Government has sought to restrain demand is by monetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Speaker, when you understand that the Bishop simply does not understand what has been involved in the conduct of macro-economic policy, you can see that while he is a man who should properly be respected in the area of religious affairs and social affairs, he is not to be accepted as any authority in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I go to the second part of the honourable member's question: Why did I not go to New York? The question is a fair one. The fact is that there were 70 world leaders there and 90 who were not there. The majority were not there. The fact is that in September I had had two visits outside Australia which meant that I was out of the country for between one and two weeks in September.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are few issues that are of greater importance to the Australian people than access to appropriate, affordable and quality housing. Obviously, every level of government has a very important role in delivering that objective. The Federal Government determines the mechanism for the finance of housing through economic, taxation and financial sector policies and through financing specific housing programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government also plays a major role through the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce in improving the variety and price of new housing through demonstrating more efficient and better quality ways of developing land and building houses. The States control the overall planning of our major cities and deliver substantial programs through State housing authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> The House may be unaware of the dramatic transformation of State housing authorities over the past seven years. The transformation has been actively supported by the Federal Labor Government, especially through the renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement last year. State housing authorities are now the most innovative lenders of home finance in the country. Within 12 months 40 per cent of all first home buyers will be financed through State housing authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, State housing authorities are developing shared equity schemes so that people can purchase a part share in their home where they could not afford to purchase the full share. These activities of the States will be assisted by the Commonwealth's decision, announced in the Budget, to transfer home purchase assistance to the States.</PARA>
<PARA> The State housing authorities also deliver a substantial public housing program with Commonwealth and State funds. Since becoming Minister I have visited all States except Tasmania to speak with housing Ministers and authorities and to see public housing at first hand. I can report that in all States the days of construction of large public housing estates are over. The States now engage in small-scale construction of quality housing and spot purchasing. So State authorities are well equipped to play important roles in the development of a national housing strategy.</PARA>
<PARA> Local government also has an important role in housing policy through land use and building approvals. Local government determines what housing choices are available to Australians. The Premiers Conference offers an ideal opportunity for Federal, State and Territory governments and the Australian Local Government Association to commit themselves to the process of jointly looking at our housing policies through the national housing strategy which I announced in the Budget. The strategy will examine the housing needs and preferences of Australians at each point of the life cycle and it will point to ways in which all Australian governments can act together to improve the efficiency of use of our existing housing stock as a community and thereby improve the housing choices available in the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The strategy will also look at ways to ensure that housing is linked to work and community services through efficient transport and appropriate location. It will look at how we can enhance the choice of housing types and tenures for all Australians. It will do this by taking a broad view, recognising that in policy terms housing is shared by all levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA> The housing strategy will publish a series of papers and there will be ample opportunity for the public to make a contribution and participate in discussion. The Premiers Conference certainly provides an ideal opportunity for all governments to commit themselves to that process and for Australia to develop a truly national approach to quality, appropriate and affordable housing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question. I can understand that there has been some uncertainty in the community arising out of the process the Industry Commission has been undergoing with aids for people with disabilities. That sort of process always generates some concerns, particularly in industries such as this, because it is a very exhaustive and rigorous process of investigation. I can confidently say that the Government's commitment to people who are profoundly deaf or with hearing impairment can be described as stronger than ever. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the National Acoustics Laboratory will be restructured with greater emphasis on service provision and efficiency and business operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Acoustics Laboratory will also be entering into a collaborative arrangement with Australian Hearing Aids. That is a very important development for Australia because it leads to the manufacture in Australia of state of the art technology that will not only benefit the Australian consumer, the person with the hearing impairment, but also lead to the development of technology with export potential.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are a win for Australian industry, the Australian taxpayer and the Australian consumer. It really is a win, win, win situation for this country. When we look at the benefits to industry, we see a new export industry arising for us with new state of the art technology brought into Australia, manufactured in Australia and exported with 80 to 100 per cent Australian content. In about 1994, when it is in full production, that will return to us about $40m a year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian taxpayer will benefit from the restructure to the tune of about $19m to $26m over a five-year period by the restructuring of these manufacturing arrangements. Of course, the Australian consumer-the hearing impaired and the deaf-will be the major beneficiary because of the new technology.</PARA>
<PARA> To give people some indication of the technology, in the past people with hearing impairments have had to struggle in an environment such as this to hear what was going on. All the noise and clutter around the place would impact upon their hearing aid, causing distortions and difficulty for them in differentiating sound. But with the new technology that we will have for the Australian consumer we will be able to provide programmable hearing aids and remote control units that will allow persons to adjust their hearing aids from their pockets to suit their particular personal circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> We now have a more responsive and efficient National Acoustics Laboratory. We have got the best products in the world, an export market and savings to taxpayers, and I do not think that we could get a much better result than that. But the real winners in all this-and this is why we have a hearing services program-are children, particularly in rural and remote areas, such as Aboriginal children who suffer a lot of hearing problems; veterans, many of whom suffered hearing damage during the war; and pensioners, about one-third of whom in Australia suffer hearing loss. So we have the best product. We also have the best service and the best value for people and now, of course, we will have an export industry to boot.</PARA>

He was thrown out on his ear because he denigrated the most disadvantaged people in the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me go to the question of sole parents. The child support scheme is a scheme which ensures that non-custodial parents support their children. Rather than cost money, which seemed to be implied in the question, the scheme saves the Government, certainly now, some tens of millions of dollars but down the track it will save quite possibly hundreds of millions of dollars. I mention the child support scheme because it is an extremely innovative example of social policy. No government has a scheme that links as effectively as this one does the taxation system to social security to ensure that those responsible pay up and those in need-the children-get the benefit of that particular payment.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the child support scheme, maintenance payments have risen from an average $25 per child to $49 per child per week. The number of non-custodial parents-not the Government-paying maintenance has gone from 30 per cent to around 80 per cent of those registered with the Child Support Agency. That is a social policy revolution.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the question of unmarried mothers. The Opposition complains about my taking time to answer questions, but I have answered numerous questions by going to the fact that teenage sole parents are far and away an exception and not the rule. No more than 4 per cent of people on sole parent pensions are teenage, so-called unmarried, mothers. That allegation is mythology; it has nothing to do with reality. Most sole parents, I have to say, are women who have been married or in a marriage-type relationship. They are in their 30s and 40s, have dependent children, and are desperately short of training and the capacity to get in the work force. That is why we have the jobs, education and training scheme, which again is a highly innovative scheme to ensure that people most disadvantaged are not made dependent on the Government, but become independent as a result of Government policy.</PARA>
<PARA> So there is a relationship between the question from the honourable member for Mallee and the attitudes of the Leader of the Opposition. They both stem from ignorance. It is the lack of knowledge and understanding, not the lack of morality, which has bedevilled conservative politics in terms of any serious social policy questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forty per cent of this is used in aerosols-products such as fly sprays and pre-wash sprays. Australia has taken a leading role in trying to phase out ozone depleting substances. With the very active cooperation and support of the Australian industry, the Government's program on ozone protection has been moving very rapidly. Chlorofluorocarbons in aerosols have been completely phased out since the beginning of the year. This, combined with other initiatives, has resulted in a reduction of CFC usage of around 50 per cent. That is five years ahead of schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been approaching methyl chloroform in the same way as we have CFCs, with as much discussion and cooperation with industry as we did with all the other ozone depleting substances. Today I met with the Aerosol Association of Australia and I can announce that the usage of methyl chloroform in aerosols will be completely phased out by the end of 1992. That is 13 years before it would be required under the newly revised protocol. We have been able to do that because of the cooperation of industry. Today, while there is no attention on this issue from the Opposition, I want to pay tribute to industry for working with us to deal with these ozone depleting substances. The Aerosol Association of Australia is to be congratulated for the work it has done. It has done this in a voluntary way and the Commonwealth now, through working with other Ministers for the environment, will work towards providing the legislative base to bring that into force. But we could not have done it, we could not have met these targets, without the support of industry. We are now at the leading edge in the phase-out of this and I want to congratulate the industry for its contribution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am somewhat perplexed by the question because, at least until very recently, there was basically a reply on the issue that has been referred to by the honourable member for Cowper which has run to four or five pages. It may be too extensive for some honourable members opposite, particularly in the National Party, to appreciate, but I do not think that there was any deliberate policy to stop answering honourable members direct with respect to the representations made to them. It is all very well for the honourable member to sit there waving bits of paper in the air. I have replied to a massive number of representations in respect of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Among the questions asked in that correspondence was one about the effect of signature of the convention upon Australia's domestic laws. That has been extensively answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention next the question of consultation regarding the convention, which has also been extensively answered. The role of parents has been extensively answered. The various paragraphs of the convention, including article 5, which is one that people have complained about, on the right to life, and the question whether the convention affects abortion laws, has been extensively answered. The question of freedom of expression and access to pornography has been extensively answered. Freedom of conscience has been extensively answered, as has freedom of association. Finally, a general information answer has been provided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one of the proud achievements of this Government that in making the size of the Commonwealth smaller by 7 percentage points of gross domestic product-or $30 billion per year-we have, at the same time, improved benefits in the social security system in the transfer payments system to the aged and to families. We have dramatically changed the priorities of government spending in favour of those who are disadvantaged, those who are handicapped and those who are least able to help themselves-those who are aged, sick and infirm. It will always be one of the proud boasts of this Government that its priorities were with the people who needed the support and help of Commonwealth funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Against that background, we are now seeing in this country a debate led by the Leader of the Opposition in which he proffers the view, in an article entitled `Hard Edged Hewson', that there is no real need for a Federal social security department, and that-as my colleague the honourable member for Batman mentioned earlier-these funds should be disbursed by voluntary agencies. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition traffic in the regard that most people in the community have for the voluntary agencies, such as St Vincent de Paul and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, to suggest that we can cut down on the $40 billion of Commonwealth funds that are payable to these categories of people under the social security system, or that they should be disbursed by these bodies. That is to say, the huge network of social security officers who deal with the complex, everyday problems of Australian people who come in to seek help, benefits and support from somebody at a counter who understands the interrelationships of those benefits-all of that sophistication would be put away as voluntary agencies would be expected to support that kind of administrative workload and to hand out those kinds of dollars. The Leader of the Opposition is quoted in the article as stating:</PARA>
<PARA>Just as there was a sea change in attitudes towards dependence on government under Whitlam, I think you are about to see a sea change in attitudes away from government-</PARA>
<PARA>that is code for cutting back funds-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the final days of Hawke and Keating which we will carry into government.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the very vicious questions you get at meetings are: `We bust our gut to fight to keep our business, struggle to pay our interest rates, pay 50 per cent of our income marginal dollar to Keating just to see him take on another group of community workers or hand-out merchants or build a bureaucracy-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to put the question in some context, and I will do that. The census data released the other day from the 1989 census of the children's services program shows that more than half the families who are using child-care were eligible for some assistance with their fees and 41 per cent of those families were eligible for the maximum fee relief-that is, they had incomes of less than $280 a week. Just to give an example of what benefits the fee relief system gives-this is to do with quality; this is to do with access and affordability, whether it be in the commercial sector or in the community sector or, from 1 January, in the commercial sector-a sole parent working 38 hours a week as a machinist would earn about $333 a week or $17,000. That is not much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Such sole parents would now be eligible for the maximum fee relief. Instead of paying $100 a week for child-care they will be paying about $15 a week. When the changes come in on 1 January there will be about another 35,000 more families who will be getting access to affordable and quality child care.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member is concerned about the commitment that the Prime Minister made on 8 March in relation to an accreditation system to go with that fee relief which will be extended to the commercial sector. We promised to establish a national accreditation system that would complement State and Territory licensing regulations-the regulations that govern the inputs. That will protect the safety of children by looking at some of the outputs. Rather than considering just the number of toilets and the number of square metres, we are looking at outcomes to give some constant guarantee right across the system that people will have that security no matter where their children are, whether they be in the commercial or the community sector.</PARA>
<PARA> The consultations that have been going on to develop that have been quite extensive and, I believe, quite successful. In doing so we will not be losing sight of the importance of containing costs and we will certainly not be losing sight of the importance of maintaining affordability for the parent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the La Trobe Valley coal liquefaction plant is in the process of decommissioning. In fact, it may be that I will attend the decommissioning ceremony. It is worth making the point that all participants regard the first stage of this important project as the most significant single energy investment by Japan anywhere in the world. It was a very large-scale project. It has garnered considerable knowledge about an important alternative energy source. All of the participants regard it as being extremely successful to date. So it ought to be seen not so much as a closing in total but as the completion of a first stage of an important energy development project that may very well be, if we have long term instability in oil prices, of considerable importance to this country in terms of utilising a resource that we have in an important policy area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, I seek to add something on this issue regarding my recent visit to Japan which I think would be of interest to the honourable member. On my recent visit to Japan I had discussions with the Prime Minister and other Ministers there on the question of our cooperation in this area, and welcomed the fact that we had had this very significant cooperation on the project at Morwell on which over half a billion dollars has been expended. Its coming to fruition now is in the natural order of the project as it was envisaged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raised with them the possibility of further cooperation on joint projects in the whole area of clean coal technology. In the international environment that is developing now there is much more emphasis on this. They welcomed that approach on my part and we will be having more detailed discussions with the Japanese to see whether there will be further opportunities, which they think there may well be, for joint Japanese-Australian cooperation in the development of clean coal technology, which not only will be of benefit here but will provide a possible basis for exports into the region. </PARA>

I am pleased, in response to his question, to be able to tell him that last week in Washington there were very constructive discussions between Senator Ray, Senator Evans and their United States counterparts on this issue, including during the Ausmin talks. At those talks there was agreement that the North West Cape should become an Australian defence facility rather than a joint facility as it is at present.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Speaker, there is no area of policy where the failure of the Government's program of micro-reform is more evident than in higher education and no area where it is more important that it be got right. Without a proper policy framework, Australia will not develop a system of higher education which has the incentives to be internationally competitive in the quality of its teaching and research and in its ability to attract students and the best minds from overseas to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just as we need to be internationally competitive in industry, we need to be internationally competitive in education. This is not just a matter of the efficiency with which resources are used, it is a matter of the quality of teaching and research. An internationally competitive system is essential to underpin the development of high technology industry in Australia; to make sure that this country has the capacity to link into the foremost developments in science and research overseas; to compete effectively in a very competitive international market for education; and, above all, to provide Australian students who have the capacity with the opportunity to attend institutions of world class quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies in this area have been little short of disastrous. One has only to open the pages of this morning's press to realise that the passage of time has done nothing to alter the reputation of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Where are they? They are not prepared to face up to the case against them on higher education. Come out of the bunker. The junior Minister, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), has approached the table. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training in this morning's press is under attack for the manner in which he has politicised the allocation of research moneys. He is under attack for the manner in which he has handled ministerial appointments, and he is under attack for the manner in which his unified national system has failed to address the issue of quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is a disciple of the bright idea, and once he gets an idea in his mind there is no stopping him. Roughly three years ago the Minister had one of these bright ideas: a bright idea to alter fundamentally the shape and character of the higher education sector, to amalgamate institutions so as to end the binary divide and create the so-called unified national system. As Michelle Grattan faithfully quoted him in her book Reformers, on the education area the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I rolled into the department in July [1987] and I had very clearly in my mind what I wanted to do, at least to a large extent . . . It was all in my head-I didn't have a piece of paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The bright idea under which Australian higher education has been suffering ever since! Grattan went on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA> With John Dawkins you sometimes get the impression that momentum is everything or nearly so. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is hard to maintain momentum when you have rolled the cart into the swamp. Today I would like to be able to say that after three years we are facing a government which has some interest in assessing the impact of the pursuit of this agenda. One would think the Government would have some interest in determining whether this process has had an impact on the quality and performance of higher education. It is an indictment that this cannot be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month at the Senate Estimates committee hearings the full extent of the failure of the Government to analyse the effects of its policies on higher education was revealed. The Government was asked whether it had undertaken any studies to ascertain whether a primary objective of the amalgamations process-namely, increased efficiency in administration-had been realised. The answer was that no studies had been undertaken. The question was asked: Does the Government have any plans to undertake such a study in the future? The answer: No, it does not have any such plans. It was asked whether any studies had been undertaken into the effect of the Government's policy of clawing back funds from the pre-1987 universities to fund the Australian Research Council? The answer was that no such studies had been undertaken into the effects of the clawback-but there was some anecdotal evidence available to the Department. We have policy by anecdote. It was asked whether any studies had been undertaken into the effect of the Government's policy of reducing per capita funding of tertiary institutions by 11.4 per cent between 1983 and 1989. The answer was that no, there were no studies. It is bad enough to rush into major changes in higher education without properly conceptualising the issues, but it is irresponsible in the extreme to make the conscious decision to avoid any assessment of what consequences these changes have had. </PARA>
<PARA> However, whilst the Minister has consciously passed up this opportunity, the higher education sector has not. It is timely to inform the House of the judgment it has passed on the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and his policies. What better than to quote the very people involved in higher education, on whom the success or otherwise of that sector rests. Let me start by quoting the late Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, Professor John Ward, who said that the so-called Dawkins reforms had:</PARA>
<PARA>produced more interference with the internal affairs of universities, including their academic affairs, than I have ever experienced in nearly half a century of academic life. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the risks associated with the reforms process? Emeritus Professor David Caro, who was vilified for these comments by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in this House, said:</PARA>
<PARA>A serious problem with some mergers is already evident. When a College of Advanced Education and a University join together, there is, it seems, an overwhelming tendency for the conglomerate to upgrade the CAE courses and to lose the particular function that they used to perform . . . I believe these changes are nothing short of a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for a Government that says that it is concerned with opportunities for students. Here we have a statement from somebody who, unlike the junior Minister at the table, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, has a lifetime's involvement and who is able to point the finger and say that opportunity for students to attend appropriate courses has been diminished in a tragic way by these reforms. The very sort of vocational courses that the colleges offered will not be available to nearly the same extent within the unified and, let us say, uniform national system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take Gordon Stanley, the Chairman of the Western Australian Higher Education Council, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the changes have led to a more centralised decision-making structure at a time when management theory recommends that this type of approach should be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Frank Hambly, the executive director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA>While Mr Dawkins was at pains from the outset to claim that the system would be deregulated-</PARA>
<PARA>the rhetoric of micro-reform was there-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the reality is there is scope for much more government control over higher education institutions than there was in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be quite clear that, as in education, as in every other sector, one cannot provide incentives for quality; one cannot secure effective institutional leadership; and one cannot get properly planned development by those at the work face while we have a system which is subject to arbitrary and centralised bureaucratic control. In this sector we have not had micro-economic reform; we have had a forced industry restructuring without consultation with those involved, and the inevitable failure of that policy is now upon us. </PARA>
<PARA> It used to be joked in the higher education sector that the Minister was very safe in his portfolio, for no-one would be keen to inherit the shambles that he had created. Yet there are some whose desperation to enter the ministry knows no bounds; or perhaps the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services grew tired of being a relic of the socialist Left, lingering on the back bench. Whatever may be the case, it was hoped that he would have remedied the chaos of the Dawkins policies; that he would have shown some independence in dealing with the mess that his senior Minister had created. But in the whole history of these mega ministries, there has been no junior Minister who has had less independence in his responsibilities than the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear to all those in higher education that he is not the person to whom they can speak and expect to see policy response. One only has to remember the sneering way that the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred to the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services in Question Time last week, particularly with respect to the Minister's commitment to an outdated interventionist approach to economics. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . not that I would pretend that I have washed away a lot of his predilections for intervention, but I do not think he would think he has a great chance of getting some of those prescriptions adopted, although I am sure he will always keep trying.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened as a result of this reorganisation is that now higher education is unable to speak to a Minister who is able to influence government policy. This vital sector in chaos does not have a voice which is going to be listened to, at least by the most senior members of the Government. Never has a junior Minister been more subservient to his senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether one looks at comments from organisations such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, or from academics or from his own colleagues, there are common themes in the criticisms of the Dawkins agenda-themes which focus on the Minister's predilection for big is better, on his fascination for central control, on his ignorance of quality, achieved through healthy competitive higher education institutions, and on his contempt for diversity. In this, the students and staff in the system have been forgotten. The conditions for teaching have deteriorated as funding per student place has declined by 11 per cent since 1983. The clawback, as I have mentioned, has damaged teaching as well as research. There are between 13,000 and 21,000 students who cannot obtain places within the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition repudiates the Government's approach to higher education. While we acknowledge that there was a need for change, we believe that many of those changes have been heading in precisely the wrong direction; that bureaucratic control, ministerial discretion without any kind of central strategic plan or vision, has damaged higher education in this country. Concepts such as quality and autonomy have been treated with contempt. They are central to ensuring that higher education is internationally competitive and serves the needs of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's fundamental commitment is to ensure that Australia has a higher education sector of world standard, and to do this it must be freed from the chains of central control. We are committed to implementing what the Minister himself has often called on his colleagues to bring about but has manifestly failed to do himself: a healthy degree of competition in the system-and I do not refer to competition for bureaucratic favours. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will abolish the centralised educational profile process. It will replace bureaucratic mechanisms with market mechanisms and provide real incentives to those who manage higher education, to pursue policies of quality which will attract the students to the institutions and impose within the system a healthy discipline to achieve world class offerings. As I told a meeting of tertiary education administrators a little under a month ago:</PARA>
<PARA>Your institutions will make the decisions, your institutions will implement the decisions and, under the coalition policy, your institutions will reap the rewards or otherwise of those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>This problem of higher education that the nation faces will not be solved by the persistence with the current policies and by trying to pretend that the problems are not there. I refer to a press release from the junior Minister to the higher education community saying that the research clawback ends. It was an attempt to reassure them with rhetoric. I set against that the answer to this question in an Estimates Committee only a few weeks ago to one of the officials of his departments:</PARA>
<PARA>Is it correct that the clawback continues in so far as the Australian Research Council is to retain an annual $65m base grant which was clawed back from the university operating budgets?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct.</PARA>
<PARA>Until the Minister faces up to the problem, there will be no solution to the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should begin by responding to a few of the more obvious furphies in the contribution of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). In one of his opening remarks he referred to the politicised allocation of research moneys. What precisely does he mean by that? I would like to hear some explicaton of just exactly in what sense the allocation of research moneys has been politicised. Obviously we have a body-the Australian Research Council (ARC)-which makes recommendations to government on the allocation of those funds. I have just received a print-out which is about a foot thick of recommendations. It makes regular recommendations on various elements of the ARC program, but what evidence does he have, apart from bland assertion, that the process has been politicised? Can he cite an instance in which the political authority has interfered with or overturned a recommendation of the Australian Research Council?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is generally accepted that the Australian Research Council, as it is now functioning, is operating exceptionally well in the sense that now it has the situation where the Research Grants Committee of the ARC has been reaching unanimous decisions. We have a situation where the ARC is reaching unanimous decisions. Those decisions are being placed before government. There is simply no evidence that he can point to of a political interference in the decisions of that entity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein referred to the appointment of the ARC chair. There has been some publicity from the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies (FASTS) alleging that there has been political interference there. Again, the claim was made that the political authority-in this case, Mr Dawkins, who is responsible for appointments-had overturned a recommendation coming from the panel that makes recommendation about appointments for that position. The reality is that that panel put forward three names, of which Professor Brennan, who was appointed to that position, was one. The Government chose to appoint Professor Brennan. </PARA>
<PARA> FASTS claimed that Professor Max Brennan was an outcast in some sense. What is the evidence for that? Professor Brennan is a former chair of the Australian Research Grants Committee, a former chair of the Atomic Energy Committee and is currently deputy chair of the Higher Education Council (HEC). He is well respected as a physicist of some note in the area of plasma physics, a recommendation which was warmly received by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee (AVCC) and Australian Committee of Directors and Principals. The honourable member for Goldstein brings this up as if it is a point of some weight and substance. In fact, it is a point of absolutely no weight and substance whatsoever and it is just an absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein talks about the profiles process. We get the same old red herring about how the profiles process is resulting in a centralisation of decision making in the higher education sector, unprecedented levels of centralised control and a terrible innovation of institutional autonomy. Again, what is the evidence for that? He finds a number of critics within the sector who are prepared to lend some credence to his remarks, but I would imagine that the ability to find a handful of people who are prepared to make those sorts of criticisms will always be a situation we will be confronted with. The reality is that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has in fact come around to being broadly supportive of the profiles process. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the honourable member for Goldstein to the document commenting on the profiles process that the AVCC issued shortly before the Federal election. It says that it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . supports the educational profile concept as it has been refined, with annual reviews and updates preferred to the former CTEC `wish list' arrangement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of system does the honourable member for Goldstein propose we ought to have? The major representative body of the traditional university sector has now come round to accepting that the profiles process is broadly acceptable and is working well. Certainly there were some initial teething problems with the nature and magnitude of the data to be collected. By and large-and I have had a number of conversations with people in this sector and the AVCC-those problems associated with data requirements have broadly been ironed out. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also say that the Higher Education Council, which is an independent advisory body to Government on the higher education system, is also legislatively required to report regularly on how the profiles process has gone. I refer the honourable member for Goldstein to the most recent report of the Higher Education Council, which again indicated that the profiles process is now working well and is now broadly supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein really is a little bit behind the times in the sense that it is now accepted that a great many of those initial concerns and problems associated with the profiles process have been broadly ironed out within the sector. But that apparently does not stop the honourable member for Goldstein continuing to raise that matter. I would like to ask the honourable member for Goldstein just what sort of mechanism he would favour for the allocation and distribution of funds throughout the higher education system? He talks about enlightened self-regulation, or some words to that effect. Well, I would have thought that the profiles process as it has been developed broadly is that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have yet to hear from the honourable member for Goldstein just what sort of allocative mechanism he favours. He shows a complete incapacity or unwillingness to provide any clues as to what his views or preferences might be. The fact is that it is a rather difficult process to establish a reasonable balance between the requirements of accountability and autonomy. We are talking about a sum of money which is roughly equivalent to one per cent of gross domestic product. To suggest there ought not to be some significant mechanisms of accountability for sums of money of that order of magnitude is, I think, absurd. I do not know whether the honourable member for Goldstein would say that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there needs to be a mechanism which enables a substantial degree of institutional autonomy and the development of a substantial degree of diversity within the system. The ability of an institution to negotiate with the Commonwealth Government and develop an institutional profile in the sort of way which has been developed, represents, I think, a reasonable balance between those competing concerns of accountability for a very large sum of public money on the one hand and the need for autonomy on the other. If the honourable member for Goldstein has some better ideas, he might like to enlighten us on them instead of coming out with absurdities criticising the Government and referring to a Senate Estimates committee's views about the need for some sort of evaluative criteria to guide the profiles negotiations. What on earth does that mean? If the Government did try to lay down some sort of evaluative criteria to apply in the profiles negotiations, there really would be a legitimate complaint from the sector about the imposition of centrally determined criteria and central direction impacting on the institutions. What does the honourable member mean by that? To what sort of criteria is he referring? What would they look like? What would they consist of? There is no clue and no indication of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the matter of clawback which the honourable member for Goldstein raised. This terrible clawback is the holding back of some $65m for allocation through the ARC program. Firstly, if we look at the growth in the ARC budget from some $86m in the first year of its operation, 1989, to something in the order of $208m next year, we see that we are talking about an amount of funding which far exceeds the figure held back from the system as a result of the clawback process. </PARA>
<PARA> Those funds do not disappear into some black hole-they are allocated back to the system. The really substantive question concerns the extent to which there ought to be a balance in the distribution of research funds between those funds which are allocated indirectly through the operating grants of the higher education institutions without being specifically earmarked for research-which is a very substantial amount of money-on the one hand, and research funds provided through some sort of competitive bidding process administered by the ARC, on the other. Any properly informed evaluation study of the Australian higher education system and the research funding mechanisms, in particular, would acknowledge that we have been a bit out of line with international practice, in the sense that an unusually large proportion of our funding for research is allocated implicitly as part of the operating grant rather than directly through an ARC-type mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> By holding back some of those funds for the ARC, we have moved to a system which is more closely in line with the norm internationally. The honourable member for Goldstein does not say what he thinks of by way of an alternative to that mechanism. I had an opportunity to discuss this issue at a fairly recent meeting of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Naturally, as people involved in the sector, they would like to see more money being put into the sector so their preference would be for those funds being allocated through the ARC to be a net addition to the sum totality of government spending on higher education. That is an understandable position from their point of view. I asked them the question that if it is the case that, for fiscal reasons, the Government cannot make that sort of net addition to higher education, did they favour, at the end of the day, apportioning some significant part of funds for higher education through a competitive bidding process of the ARC type. There was no dissent from the people at that meeting of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee with regard to the proposition that a part of research funds ought to be distributed in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> So all of this comment about the clawback is really a load of nonsense. There has been a very large increase in the totality of Commonwealth funds allocated for research in the higher education system, particularly in the last few years. We are talking about not only a huge growth in the ARC program-a 240 per cent increase in the space of three or four years-but also about the cooperative research centres program, which is an entirely new program which, when it is fully wound up, will be putting another $100m or so into research. On top of that, we also have the research infrastructure programs-mechanisms A, B and C-which the Government announced as part of the Prime Minister's science statement in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> If one puts all of that together, one is talking about a very substantial and, I suspect, an unprecedented boost in the totality of the research effort in this country. Yet the Opposition comes in here and talks about the destructive effect of government policies on research. That is absurd. If we are going to talk about the destructive impact of government policy, I suggest that we go back to the last years of the former coalition Government, to which the honourable member for Goldstein was an adviser for a period, I understand. I do not know what role he had in the determination of education policy, but I assume that he might have had some role. Let us look at the 1982 capital program. The coalition's allocation to capital in the higher education system was $32m. For 1991, 1992 and 1993 we are looking at a capital program of about $200m. That is an enormous increase-a sixfold or sevenfold increase, and I am talking in real dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there are some major problems throughout the higher education system owing to that period of capital starvation. It has taken a fair while to wind up the system, to get it back on track and get capital funding back to reasonable levels. However, the fact is that one cannot undo the sort of damage and depredations that were carried out by the previous Government in a short timeframe. Over the period 1989 to 1993 $900m has been committed to capital in real terms. We are particularly concerned to expand access to people from areas which have traditionally not had good access to higher education. We have allocated $100m to the University of Western Sydney alone. I compare that figure, again, to the totality of the coalition's capital program in the last year of its period of government-$32m. Again, I emphasise that we are talking about real dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of honourable members to the huge growth in the operating grant and the number of Commonwealth-funded places in recent years. We are looking at an increase of 100,000 in the Commonwealth-funded load in the eight-year period from 1984 to 1992. One can compare that with an increase of only 38,000 in the eight-year period from 1975 to 1983-the eight years of the previous coalition Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Whichever criteria one chooses, there is not the slightest doubt that, whatever criticisms and concerns people may have about the higher education system, there is simply no comparison between the performance of this Government and the performance of its predecessors including, I emphasise again, a government to which the honourable member for Goldstein was an adviser. In certain areas-for example, the capital program-the difference is stark and dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying all that, I do not dispute for a minute that there is a range of outstanding issues to do with the future direction of the higher education system that has to be addressed. They are significant ones, including how we effectively implement the Government's equity objectives. I agree that there are also some issues about the shape of institutions that have emerged from the major restructuring that has occurred. There is no argument about that; it would be extraordinary if that were not the case. But they are issues that have to be grappled with and come to grips with. I will shortly be receiving a policy paper from the Higher Education Council giving some advice to Government for the coming period. I intend to take the opportunity to respond to that, to formulate some considered responses to some of those future challenges. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need is rational and constructive debate about the future of higher education in this country-not the sort of baseless rubbish that we have heard from the honourable member for Goldstein and from the Opposition generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the matter of public importance in support of my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), I should like to direct my comments to research. I make the point obvious to all within the research community-certainly not within Government ranks-that the ability of the university sector to contribute to Australia's scientific and technological effort is critically threatened. Tragically, the work of decades in building up a research capacity is now unravelling. Consequently, Australia's industrial competitiveness and our ability to cope with the increasing environmental concerns are threatened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years, as most honourable members of the House would know, there has been a qualitative decline in enrolments in science courses at Australia's universities. The nation's pool of scientific and technological talent is drying up. This is a direct consequence of the community's perception of the national worth of science and technology. Though there are now belated efforts, brought on by the activism of the scientific community itself, to reverse this trend, the Government is reaping the harvest of long years of neglect. The basic research effort in the university sector has been savaged by the operation of the clawback, which, fascinatingly, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) just now described as rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine what he believes is of no consequence to the university sector. The clawback is an arrangement whereby some 4.5 per cent of the universities' total operating grants is taken from the universities and used to top up the competing grants funding which is dispensed by the Australian Research Council (ARC). The general funding base of the universities has been seriously eroded by this initiative because the bulk of their funds represent fixed commitments to salaries and the like, so that the 4.5 per cent of the operating funds clawed back by the ARC equates to some 40 per cent of their flexible funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The research infrastructure within the university sector has been crippled as a result. It is just not possible for the universities to cut back on their prime responsibility of teaching. So where do these massive cuts in funding occur? Obviously, they will have to be in infrastructure, equipment and facilities. Research infrastructure is critical to the realisation of the intellectual resources within the university sector-it hardly needs to be stated in anything else but a debate with the Minister for Higher Education. These matters were commented upon at great length and very succinctly in last year's report of the Committee of Review of Higher Education Research Policy, otherwise known as the Smith report. Its principal recommendation was that the clawback was acceptable if underpinned by the injection of new money in rough equivalence to the withdrawal of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Though the Government tried to correct the imbalance of its clawback policy in last year's May scientific statement, the infrastructure remains in a very parlous state. By 1992, on the current structure of the clawback, it has been estimated that the research infrastructure of universities will be about $100m worse off than it was in 1988. That is a massive contraction in the public sector research effort. Moreover, it is one of the main reasons that we are suffering from a brain drain and seeing so many of the best and brightest of our researchers leave Australia and, correspondingly, our inability to attract from overseas. The Smith report recognised this, as did the 11-wait for it, 11-previous reports into the same matter during the period from 1983 to 1988. But they were all discarded. So much for the Government's supposed contention that Australia must become the clever country!</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as the Minister said a little earlier, it has been claimed that all is well within the university research sector just because the Government threw some money for infrastructure to the universities last year and it has adopted Professor Ralph Slatyer's proposal for the 50 cooperative research centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine these in detail and see what impact these initiatives have had. Of the money the Government made available to universities in May 1989 to compensate for the corrosive effect of the clawback, only about half-$25m over the next three years-will make its way back into the universities. It is a mere pittance in the context of the run-down in the infrastructure as a result of the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is wider than just the universities. Anybody who doubts this should read the transcript of evidence from the chief of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts recently where he detailed the running down of the infrastructure of the CSIRO. It stands as an indictment of the Government's professed concern for research. He said that the organisation's capital base of buildings and equipment is in serious decline. To this complaint, the Government will no doubt claim that the cooperative research centres proposal will bring relief. The cooperative research centres represent only modest relief relative to the dimensions of the problems that the research community faces. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that matching funds must be made available and the scope of the difficulties that the universities find themselves in, most are hedging their bets on this one, as are a great many others within the research community. There has been no real attempt by the Government to address the chronic weakness of the manufacturing sector to develop innovative products. This, I believe, is the result of the profound impact of the Government's macro-economic policies and its failure to act on a whole range of micro-economic policies which would make the manufacturing sector, particularly in regard to high technology, more competitive and more able to pick up the opportunities that arise out of our laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA> Interaction between the public sector and the private sector in regard to research objectives and their relationship to the commercial imperatives remains appallingly low. That is not just my opinion. The recent report by the Centre for Technology and Social Change entitled Technology Strategies in Australian Industry, prepared for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, found that there is little successful interaction between the private sector and the research facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Artificially contrived schemes are not going to redress this chronic imbalance because there are structural impediments to releasing, on any extensive scale, the resources of the private sector into research and development; nor will they lead to the industry adopting changed technology strategies in any extensive manner. Incentive to work and to reap the rewards of innovation in a lower cost environment are the keys to enhanced industry participation in public sector research efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there is no national science policy. Whether one looks at the university infrastructure or that of the CSIRO and the continual failure to commercialise the breakthroughs within the public research sector, one finds continual and ongoing weaknesses. The report tabled yesterday by one of the primary sources of information and advice to the Government-the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC)-found again that there is this breakage between the private and public sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> So merely establishing the 50 cooperative research centres or pretending to make good some of the clawback are no answers to establishing a national science policy. But that is what we would expect when the portfolio of science remains in the hands of the union bully boy himself, that shop steward whose performance on 21 August-being Budget day-in reply to a question from the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was appalling. It revealed not just the operations and the mentality of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), but also his appalling ignorance of the procedures of this Parliament. We on this side of the House can hold out little or no hope--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, like the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), I read with alarm the report in the Age this morning that 400,000 students would be hit by a strike, so I took the opportunity to check out why this has occurred. I might note that this issue received more publicity in Victoria than elsewhere. I phoned the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations (FAUSA) which is the major union in the tertiary education sector. I should point out to members that I used to be the president of the local branch of FAUSA and, like the honourable member for Goldstein, I have worked in this sector of the economy for some time-and I do not come fresh to it, as he implied some of my colleagues might.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I found, when inquiring of the union, that the origins of the dispute lie really in two issues: one is the salary claims being made by academics; and the other is the general conditions of work. With respect to the salaries, this is a very difficult area to measure for any sector. Academics claim that their salaries have declined by about 30 per cent since 1973 and, as a former academic, I would say that is probably a reasonable estimation. However, they were at a peak in 1973 as a result of the very large increases that were granted by the then Labor Government. I am glad to see the honourable member for Goldstein has left, so keen is he to hear the results of government policy over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> In other respects, the claims being made by FAUSA concern conditions of work, employment, retirement, promotion and so on. The Government's attitude to these two areas is as follows: firstly, with respect to salaries, the union should negotiate directly with the vice-chancellors. If this results in a suitable package, the Government, as it has made clear in the papers this morning, will look at some kind of assistance to meet that package. With respect to the other conditions of work, I think that we will maintain the ongoing review mode that we have had over the last few years and, where the claims are just and proper, I am sure they will be adequately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> This important point needs to be made: the public of Australia is spending about $3.5 billion on tertiary education, and it is not satisfactory to measure the character of the output of that money by quoting half a dozen dissident and very senior academics who are used to one particular system-which has its flaws and advantages-and wish to see it defended to the hilt. When we came into government in 1983, the system of our education in this country was not perfect, and no-one in it would ever have pretended it was. When one looks at how it should be judged, one realises that it has to be judged by what it does by the academics' standards, what it does by the standards of students, and what it does for the community as a whole-which, after all, pays the great bulk of this $3.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said that the quality of tertiary education has gone down. This is just not true. Any academic from any Australian university can go to any university anywhere in the world and be recognised on a par with academics from other countries, as I have done regularly over the last 20-odd years that I have been in Australian universities-and things have not changed. Secondly, one cannot just judge the academic sector by quoting a small number of academics; and, thirdly, talking about the implementation of market mechanisms will not do for a $3.5 billion sector which is being built up under public sector auspices. </PARA>
<PARA> When we came into government, we had a look at the tertiary education sector and increased its funding. By the late 1980s, however, it became clear that we would have to do more than that, and the policies that we have introduced can be summarised in one word and it is not `damaging'-the word that the Opposition wishes to apply. The word is growth: growth, more growth and more growth again. The university sector in Australia under this Government has experienced a more rapid period of growth-and will continue to do so-than it has experienced possibly ever, but certainly since the heyday of Sir Robert Menzies' infusion of money into that sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the new student places. The kids in the gallery will be interested in this, I am sure. In tertiary education-which already is almost exclusively universities and soon will be totally-there have been 5,800 new places in 1990. There will be another 4,800 new places in 1991; another 4,000 in 1992; and at this stage it is proposed that in 1993 there will be another 3,000-growth, growth, growth. We have put more money into the sector to finance this growth. Why have we done this? Because we want a clever country. How do we get a clever country? We educate our kids. We get kids to stay on at school longer and then get them to go into the tertiary education system. Everybody knows that the number of kids staying on to year 12 in this country has doubled from 30-odd per cent to 60-odd per cent during the period of the Labor Government and, when these kids matriculate in year 12, many of them want to go on to tertiary education. We have provided the places-growth, growth, more growth. That is what we have been committed to, and the kids of this country, their parents and the taxpayers will appreciate it, as that feeds into this society and makes it cleverer and better for it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also made sure that there is more egalitarian access to these places as we have put them in place. We have not intervened to the degree that the Opposition is portraying. The only two universities in this country that have Government nominees on the governing boards are the University of Canberra and the Australian National University (ANU). I am the Government's House of Representatives member on the ANU Council, and you can ask the vice-chancellor how much intervening I have done. It is zero. The homogeneity of the university system may be measured by the fact that the honourable member for Goldstein, when he was Professor of Political Science at Monash University, taught cheek by jowl with one of the leading Marxist academics in this country, Alistair Davidson. Since that time, one has gone on to become a member of this House, and the other has gone on to become the Professor of Political Science at Sydney University. Homogeneity: the ultra-Right and the ultra-Left sat together for years. </PARA>

We came into power to reform certain aspects of this society and to improve it. Some people will perceive change as disruption. This is change for improvement. What have we done? We have voluntarily reduced the number of institutions in the sector from more than 60 to about 35. We have moved in the direction of providing equality of funding for all the institutions, so that people in the western suburbs of Sydney, who have never had access to university at their doorstep, will now get that access and the places they get will be funded on an equal basis with those in ivory tower universities that will still be funded. The one I worked in was the University of Adelaide-difficult to expand because of the geographic size of its campus. We have now created a new university, the University of South Australia, which will take more working class kids from the State schools in my electorate. They will matriculate in year 12 and get tertiary education access for the first time in the history of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people will experience the doubling of university places as disruption, but most people who voted us into Government will experience it as an improvement in access to knowledge. Universities did so much for the likes of me, a coalminer's son who first went to university in 1961 and who has enjoyed every minute of it. I wish more kids could enjoy the same experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Goldstein says that teaching has declined. The number of kids being taught in universities has doubled and will increase further. There are some problems with shortages of staff in certain sectors of university teaching because there has been an enormous increase in demand by kids and it is very difficult to top them up quickly because of the tenure system-which I do not criticise-and with the rigidities of staffing and so on. It is difficult to transfer people from classics to accounting overnight, but we will do it. We will put more money in and the growth will be in the areas where demand is greatest. </PARA>
<PARA> I will treat with the contempt it deserves the idea that we have reduced access to research in universities and in Australian society as a whole. What nonsense! We won the election in March on a pledge to put $100m into cooperative research centres in order to improve the research base of this society. We are doing it right now. Every member of this House should be engaging in the process of talking to suitable applicants in their electorates to ensure that we get them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, what is the Opposition going to do with tertiary education? It has pledged to cut $3 billion off our expenditure program. I would like to ask the honourable member for Goldstein before I sit down how much it will cut the growth rate of tertiary education, which has been one of the great priorities of this reforming Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make three important changes to the Copyright Act 1968. The first will enable unrestricted commercial importation of non-pirate copies of all new books appearing in the future, other than those first published in Australia or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment will suspend a copyright owner's control over importation of non-pirate copies of books first published in Australia, or first published simultaneously in Australia and overseas, when the owner cannot supply copies for more than 90 days. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment will allow the importation of single copies of non-pirate copies of books at any time to fill documented orders from customers for their private use. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> For a number of years there have been complaints from some Australian booksellers and from consumers that the right of copyright owners to control the commercial importation of their books has restricted the availability of imported books and inflated their prices. In 1983 the Government therefore asked the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC) to report on whether the provisions of the Copyright Act establishing the copyright owners' control over importation should be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> In a report in September 1988, the CLRC recommended relaxation of the importation provisions where the copyright owner could not make copies available within a reasonable time. The CLRC's recommendations received substantial support, and prompted widespread discussion and media coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> In making its recommendations, the CLRC made the comment that there had been insufficient evidence before it to determine the question of the effect of the present legislation on the price of books in Australia. Consequently, the then Minister for Consumer Affairs decided to refer the question of book prices to the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). </PARA>
<PARA> In an interim report in September 1989, the PSA concluded that Australian book prices were higher than those in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. It recommended total repeal of the copyright owner's right of control over importation of books, subject to 2 exceptions, namely, Australian authored books published separately in Australia and pirated copies. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA's proposals were strongly supported by consumer groups, media commentators and many booksellers. However they were opposed by authors, publishers and other booksellers, who said that wholesale repeal of copyright owners' control over imports would seriously damage authors' incomes and Australian publishers' viability. They also asserted that the proposed singling out of Australian books would be inconsistent with Australia's obligations under the Berne Copyright Convention. They urged adoption, instead, of the CLRC recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible Options for Reform</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Given that both reports recommended changes to the importation provisions of the Copyright Act and that all protagonists in the debate favoured adoption at least of the CLRC's recommendations, there was an overwhelming case for modifying copyright owners' control over imports. The PSA's findings on the comparison of Australian and overseas book prices strongly suggested that a more fundamental reform than the CLRC's recommendations was needed. </PARA>
<PARA> My predecessor interviewed representatives of a number of interests with various views on this issue. It became apparent from comments received on the PSA report that adoption in full of its recommendations was likely to give rise to a number of adverse consequences. I shall summarise some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, while in world terms a reasonably substantial consumer of books, is nevertheless a small player in the world English language book market, the bigger players being the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. If all restrictions were removed on the importation of books, the influx of cheap overseas books produced for much bigger domestic markets would threaten economic loss to both Australian publishers and Australian authors. While consumers might benefit from such abolition by gaining access to the cheapest priced overseas books, they as well as Australian authors and publishers would suffer from the resultant decline in distinctively Australian literature. </PARA>
<PARA> The question whether the presently available range of books would improve or decline on introduction of an open market is hotly disputed. However, there seems sufficient doubt to question seriously whether there would be any overall improvement in present distribution arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is noteworthy that two of the bigger players in the world English language, the United Kingdom and Canada, have recently introduced new copyright laws reaffirming copyright owners' control over imports. In the case of Canada, protection of local culture was an important consideration. In those circumstances it seemed foolhardy for Australia, given its size in the world English language book market, to unilaterally expose its writers and publishers to competition from which writers and publishers in the larger English language countries remain protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concluded that complete repeal of the importation provisions would pose too great a risk to Australian literature in general and to both Australian authors and Australian publishers in particular. We therefore looked for a solution short of complete repeal. From the discussions and submissions that my predecessor and I and my Department had, a solution emerged which now finds its expression in the Bill I am introducing. I acknowledge the value of the contributions made by the various interests who took part in the discussions and made the submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>Benefits of the Reforms</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the Bill, owners of the copyright in overseas books which are not first published in Australia will lose the right to control imports of legitimate copies of the book into Australia, that is, to exclusively supply the Australian market. It should be noted that books `first published in Australia' will include books first published abroad that are subsequently published in Australia within 30 days. This is because it is already so provided in section 29(5) of the Copyright Act, and the Berne Convention states that a work shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in several countries if published in two or more countries within 30 days of first publication. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA proposal for singling out Australian authors for preferential treatment could risk censure as contravening the requirements of the Berne Convention to give national treatment to authors of all other Convention countries. The Bill avoids this problem by not distinguishing between books according to the nationality of their authors. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment in the Bill will mean an open market in Australia for new books not first published in Australia, as defined, and thus their early availability here. As a result, the cheapest editions will be able to be brought in and, consequently, there could be some marginal downward pressure on book prices generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Owners of copyright in books first published in Australia will, as now, have control over imports. In conformity with the Berne Convention this will apply regardless of whether the author is Australian or foreign. However, to the extent that foreign authors or copyright owners will seek to preserve their control over imports by publishing in Australia within 30 days of first publication abroad, Australian publishers may stand to gain extra business. Australian consumers will stand to gain from the resulting earlier availability of the books concerned. As regards availability, Australian consumers will gain whether the overseas book is published within 30 days in Australia or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Authors</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australian authors who publish first in Australia will retain their exclusive rights. That is, the changes to the importation provisions will permit Australian authors to deal with their copyright as they do now. The approach adopted by the Bill will overcome concerns expressed about importation of cheap, low quality copies, the remaindering of overseas copies in Australia with a consequent loss of revenue for authors and the so-called devaluation of copyright. Authors at the start of their careers need not fear that prospective publishers will be justified seeking world rights, and can expect that there will continue to be opportunities to have their works accepted for publication to meet the local Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Booksellers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Booksellers as well as consumers have been concerned about high prices and delays in availability in Australia of stocks of new overseas books. They have not been able to meet legitimate consumer demand at a time when public interest is high, resulting in a loss of potential sales. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the new law a bookseller will have the right to import directly, for commercial purposes, books which are first published in a foreign country and not in Australia. Just as importantly, the amendments will enable a bookseller to import books first published in Australia where the copyright owner is unable to supply the books to the bookseller within 90 days of a written order. Moreover, the bookseller will be able to continue to import until such time as the copyright owner is able to fill the order, that is, is able to resupply the local market. Honourable members should particularly note that this right to go offshore when the copyright owner is unable to maintain supplies will apply to all existing titles as well as titles published after the amendments come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the copyright owner has first published a title in Australia by release of hardback copies and a paperback edition is released overseas, a bookseller can import paperbacks 90 days after placing an order for them, unless the copyright owner can supply that order within that time. It is not sufficient if, in response to the order, the copyright owner offers hardbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as part of the CLRC's recommendations, the Bill will introduce the right of booksellers to import a book at any time-regardless of its place of first publication or availability from the copyright owner in Australia-on the written order of a customer for that customer's personal use. As honourable members may be aware, it is permissible for any person now to bring a book into Australia or order a book from overseas if it is not done for the purpose of commercial distribution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the legislation will mean that, if the Australian rightholder of a new overseas title wishes to maintain his or her exclusive right to supply the Australian market, he or she will be required to publish simultaneously in Australia and to maintain adequate stocks of copies, including paperbacks. Otherwise, there will be an open market for the book, either generally after 30 days from overseas publication-if there is no publication in Australia within that time-or, for those booksellers whose orders the copyright owner has been unable to fill for more than 90 days, until supply from that source is restored. This will provide booksellers with speedier access to stocks and, in some cases, enable them to provide more cheaply priced books. </PARA>
<PARA>Publishers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The changes introduced by the Bill also accommodate the legitimate needs of book publishers. They will be able to protect their investment in the Australian market provided they supply it promptly. It must be recognised that the investment made by publishers and their contribution to the Australian economy and its work force are substantial. Furthermore, the changes will enable publishers to continue to support authors whose works are destined primarily for the Australian market. This is important for Australian culture.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Consumers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Australian consumer has, in some cases, been denied access to overseas works as the copyright owner has, for one reason or another, not seen fit to supply the local market. In other cases, the time taken to supply the market has been unduly slow. The changes will ensure that the consumer will have early access to overseas works as there will be an open market if the copyright owner does not supply it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is very important in the case of educational and technological titles when unavailability denies access to information which is essential to maintain a competitive position or `knowledge equality'. In the case of price, there has been considerable concern about the price of works and, in particular, about the inability to purchase lower-priced paperbacks. The changes effected by the Bill overcome the problem of access to paperbacks as these may be imported if the copyright owner does not choose to supply them. In the case of new overseas titles not published in Australia within 30 days, consumers stand to gain the benefit of the cheapest overseas editions. </PARA>
<PARA>Review of Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> While the Government thus believes that it has achieved a balanced reform in the amendments, it recognises that the amendments are a substantial departure from the existing law. Accordingly, the Government has decided that their effect should be reviewed after they have been in operation for a time. It is proposed that after three years from their commencement an appropriate reference will be given to the Prices Surveillance Authority to determine the impact of the amendments on book prices, which was one of the original concerns giving rise to the reform moves. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments effected by this Bill will have no direct impact on Commonwealth expenditure. However, the Bill is likely to lead to reduction in prices of some books supplied to Australian consumers. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill completes the new superannuation arrangements that apply to Commonwealth employees and, at the same time, represents a further step in the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is twofold. Firstly, the Bill provides for the transfer of the trustee function of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust (SFIT) in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to a joint employer-employee Board of Trustees. Secondly, it provides for the conversion of SFIT into a wholly Commonwealth owned public company to be called Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd (CFM). </PARA>
<PARA> SFIT was established in 1976 under the Superannuation Act 1976 as a statutory authority with trustee responsibility for the management and investment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. The Fund contains the contributions of the members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the income earned from SFIT's investment of those contributions, as well as, since 1 July 1990, employer 3 per cent productivity contributions. Management of the Fund and the investment performance of the Fund are important to both the members of the superannuation scheme and to the Government in its role as a responsible employer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's superannuation policy, expressed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards, is that responsibility and control for superannuation funds should be in the hands of joint employer-employee boards of trustees. The new public sector superannuation scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1990 is fully in accord with this policy. The Board of Trustees has full responsibility for the administration of the scheme and the investment of Fund moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the new public sector superannuation scheme was introduced, changes were made to the administration of the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme. A Commonwealth Superannuation Board was established with responsibilities for the invalidity retirement process and setting the interest rate to be allocated on members' contributions. The Commissioner for Superannuation, however, retained his statutory duties under the Superannuation Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill reconstitutes the Commonwealth Superannuation Board as the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 2. This joint employer-employee Board retains the responsibilities of the former Board and, in addition, will have responsibility for the management of the Superannuation Fund for the 1976 scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> With this amendment, administration of the two main superannuation schemes for public servants will be in line with the Occupational Superannuation Standards, private sector practice, and other new superannuation schemes in the Commonwealth sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme now will have an appropriate say in the management of their superannuation fund through the trustees nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions to represent the members. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes that have been made to the Superannuation Act 1976 relating to the operations of SFIT since it was first established have placed SFIT on a fairly independent footing with the freedom and flexibility to manage and invest moneys of the Fund in a commercial manner. In 1986, restrictions on SFIT's investment powers were removed to enable it to compete with the private sector for investment opportunities. Further amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 1990, have provided SFIT with the power to provide investment services on a fee for service basis to a range of clients within the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> As investment manager of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, SFIT manages one of the largest portfolios in the country with over $5.8 billion under management. SFIT operates in all major domestic financial markets and has a portion of the fund invested in international equities. Its performance over recent years has placed it among the top performing fund managers, according to published surveys of comparable pooled superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom and Australia Post and some other government business enterprises (GBEs), whose employees were previously members of the 1976 Commonwealth superannuation scheme, have now established their own superannuation schemes. As a result, SFIT has lost its monopoly over the management and investment of those funds and is now required to compete with the private sector for their management. Any significant withdrawal of GBE funds would make it difficult for SFIT to maintain, without the changes I am introducing today, the rates of return it has achieved in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> To be able to compete successfully with the private sector for GBE funds, and attract new clients, SFIT needs to be allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise able to respond quickly in the marketplace, free from day-to-day regulatory controls. Moreover, freeing SFIT from its trustee responsibilities has marketing advantages because it will no longer be seen by prospective clients as having to give priority to the management of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The reform package is therefore a necessary step in the continued development of SFIT. The objective is to establish it as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international marketplace. Conversion of SFIT into a wholly Commonwealth-owned public company incorporated under the Companies Act 1981 will enable this objective to be achieved but at the same time provide for an organisation with the capacity to ensure the protection of the returns of members of the Commonwealth superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of important elements in the CFM reform package. Firstly, there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for CFM. These will include the provision by CFM of a three-year corporate plan which will define the company's goals, financial targets and strategies to achieve those goals. Financial targets will be set and CFM will report annually giving an account of its performance against goals. </PARA>
<PARA> CFM's memorandum and articles of association will be registered, as with any public company, with the National Companies and Securities Commission. The Minister responsible for CFM will exercise control on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CFM board of directors. Also, the Minister responsible for CFM will be able to issue guidelines to the board. </PARA>
<PARA> With CFM's establishment as a general funds manager competing for the management of other funds, it will be important that board members have suitable investment experience and business acumen. The board will be appointed by the Minister from suitably qualified men and women in accordance with Government policy. Existing members of SFIT will be eligible for appointment to the board. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, CFM will be required to operate in accordance with the Companies Code. This will provide for the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth through its rights as a shareholder of the company. Under the Companies Code the company's directors have specific responsibilities to shareholders as well as other defined obligations. There will also be revised remuneration arrangements for the chief executive officer. </PARA>
<PARA> CFM will be expected to continue to comply with government wages and industrial relations policies, in particular with those guidelines developed specifically for GBEs in March 1989. It is intended that CFM operate as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory. The arrangements proposed for CFM are essentially the same as those already applying to other GBEs such as Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now summarise the key elements of the Bill. The Bill provides for the conversion of SFIT from its current statutory authority status to a public company incorporated under the Companies Act. The Bill comes into effect in several stages on royal assent and through two proclamations. This is to facilitate the creation of the capital structure, incorporation of the new company, the transfer of SFIT's trustee role to the board of trustees, and the repeal of sections of the Superannuation Act 1976 relating to the establishment of SFIT and its operations as a statutory authority. This also allows for the development of an appropriate memorandum and articles of association, an appropriate balance sheet, financial performance indicators, and a strategic plan to enable the Minister responsible for CFM to undertake strategic oversight of the company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill ensures the continuity of SFIT as a legal entity during the transition. Legally, continuity of the corporate entity dispenses with the need to transfer assets and liabilities from SFIT to a new body corporate. This means that all contracts, agreements and arrangements entered into by or on behalf of SFIT which are in force immediately before transition in respect of most of the assets and liabilities automatically apply to the new company. However, because of the need for some financial adjustments to be made between SFIT and the board of trustees, the Bill provides for the transfer of certain assets and liabilities of a non-trading nature. In addition, the assets and liabilities held by SFIT in its capacity as manager of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund will be transferred to the board of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill ensures continuity of employment and staff conditions during the transition. Each staff member of SFIT will become an employee of the new company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the statutory authority. Accordingly there are provisions enabling current employees' accumulated entitlements, rights under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 and rights of entry into the Australian Public Service to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the establishment of SFIT as an incorporated company limited by shares through the registration of the memorandum and articles of association for CFM with the National Companies and Securities Commission. At the same time, SFIT's trustee function in respect of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is transferred to a joint employer-employee board of trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> The board of trustees becomes responsible for the management and investment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, which is to be known as Commonwealth Superannuation Fund No. 2. The Bill provides for CFM to be retained as the sole investment manager of the fund and the fund of the new public sector superannuation scheme until at least 30 June 1995. After this date, it is proposed that CFM will have to compete for the management of the funds with other fund managers. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the financial implications of the Bill. The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth. It does, however, provide that CFM be given a Commonwealth guarantee on initial borrowings of up to $20m borrowed prior to 30 June 1995 for working capital purposes. As a wholly Commonwealth-owned public company, CFM will be required to pay dividends to the Commonwealth. The Bill provides for exemptions from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes on the transition to a company and transfer of assets, recognising that there has been no change in the beneficial ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is twofold: firstly, it will facilitate the payment by the Commonwealth of the refund of advanced payments paid before 30 June 1990 by overseas students unable to undertake or complete courses of study in Australia. This may be by way of direct payments to the students or through loans to institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases where institutions close as a result of a tighter entry and stay criteria, the Commonwealth will refund outstanding living allowance payments to eligible overseas students already in Australia and provide limited financial assistance to institutions which offer places to displaced students. The Commonwealth's liability in these circumstances is limited to those students who had enrolled and paid fees on or before 24 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill will secure the Commonwealth's position in relation to recovery of moneys paid out in refunds on behalf of institutions in difficulty by clarifying matters to do with, for example, evidentiary issues and access to documents relevant to assessment and recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has no direct financial impact but there is an allocation of up to $50m which will be included in the Appropriation Acts for the purposes of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The export of education services has grown considerably since 1986 when the policy of encouraging institutions in Australia to accept full-fee paying overseas students came into effect. Those policy changes have mainly focused on overseas students in our public sector institutions. The Government is satisfied with respect to public sector institutions that standards are consistently high, that current entry and monitoring policies are working soundly, and that there has been a significant contribution to export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> However, many of our overseas students are undertaking short courses, mainly in English language, at private sector institutions. Given that our chief markets for higher education courses are in Asia, prior English language study is necessary for most overseas students enrolling in our tertiary institutions and the English language intensive courses for overseas students institutions provide a valuable bridge to tertiary study. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there were fewer than 1,400 English language students in Australia and about 500 students in other non-formal short courses. At 1 June this year, by contrast, there were 23,500 full-fee paying overseas students studying in Australia in short courses provided by private institutions; 19,569 of these were enrolled in English language intensive courses for overseas students. Between 1986 and 1990 the number of institutions providing those courses mushroomed from 19 to 105, of which about two-thirds are privately owned, some apparently by overseas interests. </PARA>
<PARA> To fill this rapidly expanding capacity, it is clear that a number of these institutions marketed their courses vigorously, in ways which sometimes threatened the integrity of Australia's immigration program. In short, they concentrated their marketing efforts in certain countries whose nationals represented a high risk with regard to overstaying their visas. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure the House that the Government has taken all necessary steps to protect the integrity of Australia's immigration program. Since December 1986, when streamlined processing for student visa applications was introduced, entry arrangements have been under constant review and have been tightened as necessary. From July 1988 institutions were required to screen students for suitability to undertake their courses, and prospective students were required to pre-pay course fees and, in some cases, living expenses. Both institutions and students also needed to make declarations that they would meet their respective obligations under the overseas students program. Regrettably, not all institutions, as subsequently became apparent, behaved with probity in relation to moneys paid in advance. It is this misconduct that has given rise to the need for this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> By the middle of 1989, it had become clear that further government intervention in the program would be needed. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs had already identified China as a high-risk country in terms of students overstaying visas. Institutions were, nevertheless, recruiting heavily there and by June 1989 there was a backlog of some 26,000 student visa applications in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA> In August, following the events of 4 June in Tiananmen Square, the Australian Government decided to temporarily suspend further recruitment of Chinese students. It also required those who had already applied to meet stricter entry criteria relating to age, previous level of educational attainment and the relevance of intended course of study to future employment. In the meantime, a further 12,000 student applications had been received in China, adding to the backlog. In large part, this was due to some institutions simply ignoring directions by the Australian Government to suspend recruitment temporarily. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1990 recruitment in China was allowed to recommence. However, rigorous new visa requirements were instituted, which were designed to establish that any applicant was indeed a bona fide student coming to Australia principally for the purpose of study. Pre-visa assessment now ensures that only those students who have a high probability of approval are asked to commit themselves financially. Institutions are now not permitted to collect fees in advance from individual students until pre-visa assessment has been completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The accumulation of requests from rejected applicants for refunds of pre-paid moneys, coming at the same time as a reduction of the number of new students enrolling in short courses due to the introduction of tightened visa requirements, has led to cash flow problems in a number of colleges. As I indicated earlier, some of these institutions also failed to protect the funds advanced by students. By August this year, the Department of Employment, Education and training estimated, on figures provided to it by institutions, that of the 17,500 rejected students, mainly Chinese nationals, some 12,000 refunds had been made. This left almost 6,000 students still waiting for the refund of their pre-paid fees. The failure of a number of institutions to meet their refund obligations has had severe financial consequences for the rejected applicants. It has obviously damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole and it has adversely reflected on Australia's commercial reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of these considerations-particularly Australia's standing as a reliable trading partner-the Government has undertaken to pay the outstanding refunds to rejected students and pursue recovery action against those institutions which have not repaid the amounts owing. It has been suggested that the problems of the industry reveal a case of deregulation gone wrong. This, however, represents an essential lack of understanding of the situation. Export of education services is, after all, a new area of economic activity for Australia and has been allowed to establish in an environment of very limited regulation; early on it was thought that there was too much regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> In an industry such as this it is not surprising that there have been problems associated with its establishment. In the light of experience, however, we can now see that the growth has been too fast and that a greater degree of regulation is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to ensure that all institutions providing education services to overseas students meet minimum national standards in terms of the service they provide, their facilities and their financial management. Accordingly, the Government will be introducing legislation to establish a firm basis for the regulation of the private sector of the industry, in cooperation-I stress-with the relevant State and Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the problems, provision of education services to overseas consumers must be recognised as a potentially significant source of foreign exchange earnings for Australia. Australia is well placed to develop as a centre of international education. Our advantages include an obvious congenial environmental amenity, our predominant use of the English language, a similar time zone to South East Asia, obvious relative geographic proximity to Asia, the existence of facilities for pursuing cultural and religious activities, and our cost competitiveness in terms of fees and living expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to be aware, as Ross Garnaut has pointed out, that education of foreign students in Australia does much more than merely provide the economic benefits of an export industry. It additionally increases the range of courses available to Australians. It builds interpersonal links that are important to our economic, political and cultural relations with the region and it familiarises young Australians with the regional environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation we cannot afford to squander long term opportunities because of some xenophobic reactions to initial, short term problems. The export of education services is and will remain of great importance both to our economic performance and to our framework of foreign relations, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>On 22 May 1990, I announced the Government's intention to bring legislation before the Parliament to provide an effective means of limiting aggregate foreign ownership of Australian commercial radio and television broadcasters to an absolute maximum of 20 per cent. The Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill will give effect to that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Act's current rule prohibiting control of a broadcasting service by a foreign individual will continue. This means that any individual foreign person or company, that is, a company more than 50 per cent owned by foreigners, will never be allowed to have actual control or a level of direct or indirect interests exceeding 15 per cent in an Australian licensed broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill prevents contrived schemes which, under provisions introduced in 1981, make possible foreign equity levels well in excess of the 20 per cent aggregate limit through complex company structures. The Bill reintroduces tracing of indirect foreign interests in broadcasters, using a proportional tracing mechanism, to ensure that aggregate direct or indirect foreign ownership of Australia's broadcasters is strictly limited to 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced on 22 May 1990, licensees with direct or indirect interests then in excess of the 20 per cent aggregate limit will have three years from that date in which to comply. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will have the power to grant extensions of that period if it considers it to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This discretion recognises the commercial realities facing licensees. Investment is essential to broadcasters, as it is to other businesses. Because we wish Australians to enjoy high quality broadcasting services which reflect the diversity of our community, and we certainly do, we have to ensure that reasonable investor confidence is maintained. The Bill provides for an orderly process of restructuring to remove excess foreign interests. The only way this can be assured is to give the Tribunal power to consider all relevant matters, while making it clear that the Government's concern is to ensure the limits are achieved quickly, without affecting the quality of services provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal will be able to have regard to all matters it considers relevant to its decision, but will be required to consider certain specific matters which the Government judges to be significant. Firstly, the Tribunal must consider the effect on the ability of broadcasters to meet their licence obligations to provide adequate and comprehensive services within their service areas. Secondly, it must ensure that licensees comply with the letter and spirit of these amendments. The Tribunal is, therefore, required to consider the desirability of compliance with the condition as soon as possible. Thirdly, the Government recognises its responsibility to provide clear guidance to investors, the industry and the Tribunal on issues involving foreign interests in our electronic media. The Bill will require the Tribunal to consider relevant statements of policy referred to it by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared to see the long term continuation of excess foreign ownership merely because investors have paid too much for media interests and now face losses. The Government makes this point now to give affected parties due notice. It is well known that some investors have, in the past, greatly overvalued the potential earnings of broadcasting licensees and the protection from competition those licensees previously enjoyed. It is not this Government's function to protect those investors from the effects of bad commercial decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that the legislation is not intended to allow excess levels of foreign ownership to persist for undue periods merely in order to avoid investors having to sustain losses due to changing values of their assets. Investors will not be allowed to hang on, waiting for unrealistic prices. The second feature of the Bill is a limit on the number of foreign directors of broadcast licensees to 20 per cent of the total. It is necessary to limit the direct influence which foreign directors can bring to bear on the day-to-day management of licensees. This rule is not intended as a reflection on the integrity and professionalism of foreign directors. It is simply a recognition that directors are in a position to influence the operations of licensees. We have to recognise that broadcasting services are an important source of information on local and overseas events and issues for most Australians. The Government believes it is vital that decisions affecting them should be predominantly in the hands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now deal with the question of the foreign ownership limits in more detail. It will be clear from a reading of the Bill, and the explanatory memorandum that I will shortly be presenting, that the tracing of interests through a corporate chain is a complex matter. The foreign ownership limits have been applied by way of licence condition since they were introduced in the 1950s. This means that the responsibility for compliance rests ultimately with the licensee. To this end, the Act requires all licensees to include powers in their articles of association to divest interests which would place them in breach. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees assume responsibility for a variety of licence conditions when they accept a licence. They undertake to provide a level of service, to comply with certain program standards and with the requirements of the legislation. In certain circumstances, compliance with any of these conditions may be difficult or affected by the actions of third parties. It is entirely reasonable to require them to ensure that they comply with limitations on ownership comparable to those applied in other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Broadcasting Act already provides- section 92H for television, section 90M for radio- that the chairman or other director approved by the Tribunal and the secretary or manager of the licensee must each year give the Tribunal statutory declarations stating whether, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the foreign ownership provisions of the Act have been complied with at all times during that period, and the particulars of any contravention of that condition; and what steps he or she has taken to ascertain the matters referred to in the declaration. In the end result, the Tribunal must be satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken by the licensee to comply with the condition. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees should be assisted in this task by the fact that the provisions are so drafted that they apply only to the most direct foreign interest and not to additional foreign interests traced through that first interest. The Bill avoids this `double counting' of interests and, by limiting the number of interests which could be ascertained only by searching foreign share registers, further limits the effort required of licensees in monitoring compliance with the condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised the commercial realities facing licensees and the practical difficulties facing the Tribunal in the method of tracing aggregate interests. As mentioned above, a proportional tracing mechanism will be employed. This deems a person or company to have a proportion of interests held by another company, calculated on the basis of the proportion of interests that first person or company holds in the second company. This continues down a chain of companies to a licensee company. For example, if company A owns 10 per cent of company B, which owns 50 per cent of a licensee, company A is deemed to hold 10 per cent of 50 per cent, or 5 per cent of the licensee. If applied indiscriminately, however, this method could require licensees to search through every shareholding, however remote, in a chain to determine whether it is held by a foreigner. This would prove difficult, expensive and futile where such interests are minuscule and remote. </PARA>
<PARA> As a government, we are totally committed to the 20 per cent aggregate limit, but not just as an aim in itself. We are committed to it as one of the practical guides to ensure that Australian broadcasters remain in the control of Australians. We are not concerned with it as an exercise in mathematics and, therefore, expect that the efforts of licensees and the Tribunal will be directed towards ensuring that the limit is met in practice. We do not expect licensees to pursue foreign interests to the ultimate degree when it is clear already that they comply with the condition. The Tribunal will not make unreasonable demands on licensees. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence, the Government has decided that any minority foreign interests that may lie behind `minor' interests-2 per cent or less, direct or indirect-held by Australian companies in licensees will normally be disregarded. This will allow minor traced interests to be disregarded except where the Tribunal suspects that, if those interests were counted, there is a real chance that the aggregate limit would be exceeded. In that case, the Tribunal will be able to direct that the minor interests or a class of interests should be counted, and their foreign ownership levels investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> This will enable the Tribunal to concentrate on areas of real risk, without the need for most licensees to go through the futile exercise of calculating precisely by how much they comply. If a licensee has 14 per cent aggregate foreign interests and might, if an exhaustive search were conducted, be found to have 14.1 per cent, the Government is not interested, and would not expect the Tribunal to be interested. The Government is proposing a Tribunal discretion, and does so in full confidence that the Tribunal will exercise its powers to examine minor interests responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further safeguard, the Bill provides that excess foreign interests do not and will not breach the licence condition for a period of 28 days after the licensee became aware of the failure or should have become aware of the failure. Again the Tribunal has the power to extend that period if it considers it to be in the public interest to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Licensees, therefore, have the opportunity to ensure that any excess interests are divested before they lead to a breach. This means the licensee should never be placed in breach of the conditions of its licence inadvertently or unreasonably. The requirement is to exercise proper diligence and to act when a contravention is identified. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like honourable members, and broadcasters for that matter, to be clear about the importance the Government attaches to these limits. We do not propose any amendment to the requirement of the Broadcasting Act that the Tribunal may not renew any licence where there has been a breach of the condition. The period of grace provision has the effect, as I have mentioned, of preventing any excess foreign interest becoming a breach until 28 days, or that period as extended, after the licensee becomes aware or should become aware of the interest. This protects the licensee against failures to comply which go beyond its reasonable control. It offers no protection beyond the 28-day period to licensees deliberately or negligently breaching the requirement. Neither does it prevent the Tribunal exercising its discretion not to renew a licence or to renew a licence for less than the maximum period, if the circumstances warrant, whether or not a technical breach of the condition exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The view has been expressed that these provisions are inconsistent with the thrust of the efficiency package amendments currently being considered in another place. I would remind honourable members that the purpose of that package was to enable the Tribunal and licensees to concentrate on matters of real importance. The Government considers that effective controls on levels of foreign investment in Australia's commercial broadcasters are matters of real importance. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will place some additional responsibilities on the Tribunal in investigating possible breaches of licence conditions. However, the Government does not expect the Tribunal to monitor compliance on an on-going basis; only, as I have said, to investigate situations which indicate reasonable grounds for belief that a breach has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Some $80,000 has been allocated to the Tribunal this financial year to cover additional costs which cannot be offset. Sums of $50,000 have also been earmarked for each of the next two financial years for the same purpose. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 will give effect to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of 19 July 1990, in his speech `Towards a Closer Partnership' proposing a major review of Commonwealth-State relations, that the Commonwealth would respond positively to the request made by some of the States to transfer the debits tax to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will facilitate transfer of responsibility for debits tax from the Commonwealth to States and Territories. It does this by amending the Debits Tax Act to terminate imposition of the tax by the Commonwealth. The transfer of the tax base to the States has the potential to rationalise the taxation of financial services and provides the States with an additional revenue source. The transfer of the debits tax to the States will have no net impact on Commonwealth or State finances as the reduction in Commonwealth revenue will be offset by an adjustment to financial assistance grants to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> As an interim measure, while the States and Territories put the necessary legislative and administrative mechanisms in place, the Commissioner of Taxation will collect debits tax on behalf of the States and Territories. For this purpose the Bill will also amend the Taxation Administration Act to authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to make arrangements with taxation commissioners of the States and Territories under which the Federal Commissioner can collect on their behalf debits tax imposed by States and Territories. The transfer of debits tax to the States and Territories will take effect on a date to be proclaimed. It is expected that this will occur on 1 December 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 contains a range of amendments to legislation affecting industrial relations in Australia. The major amendments relate to the position of certain members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and also strengthen the compliance provisions in the Bill so far as employers are concerned in relation to contributions to superannuation funds on behalf of their employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that the Opposition will seek to amend this Bill during the committee stage to insert into it the provisions of a private member's Bill that was introduced by Senator Chaney, as he then was, in 1988 to vest in the Industrial Relations Commission and also in the Federal Court of Australia certain injunctive powers in relation to non-compliance with awards by organisations and individuals. In the event that those amendments are defeated, we will not vote against this Bill. We accept the proposition that if it is the law of this country that superannuation be part of the award fixing mechanism, it is only fair and proper that the law sees to it that people who are entitled to and are awarded superannuation benefits should in fact receive those benefits. To the extent that any employer is falling short of his or her obligation to make those payments, then it is only fair and reasonable that proper restitution be available to employees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the spirit of that award compliance approach that we believe the other side of the ledger should be looked at. There is a great deal of talk these days about neutrality in economics, about the level playing field and about fair treatment. We take the view that if it is good enough to oblige employers to stick to the terms of an award and there is some constraint placed upon them if they do not, it is only fair and reasonable that the same approach apply in relation to organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The major purpose of my contribution to this debate is not to talk about some of the finer details of this legislation-no doubt other speakers will do that-but rather, because it is a general industrial relations measure, to take the opportunity of addressing some general remarks to the industrial relations and wage fixing debate in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever interpretation one places on the remarks of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, it is fair to say that he has put wages policy back on the agenda. In the course of doing that I think he has done a public service because wage fixing is a very key element of economic policy; wage fixing is an area where the differences between the Government and the Opposition are starker than in other economic areas; and wage fixing is an area where there are a large number of myths. Politics in Australia abounds with many myths, and wage fixing is certainly one of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the wage fixing debate has to be an examination of the accord between the present Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which has now been in operation for over seven years. In looking at the accord a rather obvious thing ought to be acknowledged-and it is ironic in terms of some of the debate of the last few days about Bernie Fraser's speech-and that is that, in a sense, any accord between a government and the trade union movement of a nation has the potential to involve, and often involves in reality, a wage-tax deal. In fact, to suggest that in some way a wage-tax deal would involve anything more than a renegotiation or an extension of the existing accord between the Government and the trade union movement is to misunderstand the nature of that understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the accord in some respects has delivered some benefits that might not otherwise have been available. Like any instrument of that kind, it is necessary to balance the benefits against the detriment. There is no doubt that over the last 7 1/2 years there has been a reduction in real wages. That has had benefits for the total economic condition, although it has carried severe detriment for the millions of Australian workers who have not enjoyed a maintenance of their real incomes. There is some debate as to what is the right measure of that reduction. I notice, interestingly enough, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and senior Ministers in the Government in recent times have sought to talk about real unit labour costs. The Prime Minister at Question Time today said there had been a reduction of something like 10 1/2 per cent in real unit labour costs over the last few years. If one takes the measure of real wages, which is another measure, one finds that the reduction in real wages between 1982-83, the financial year in which the Government of this country changed hands, and 1989-90 has been of the order of 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are going back over the history of the accord, it is fair to say, interestingly and significantly enough, that almost half, 2.4 per cent, of the reduction of 5 per cent-if one uses the measure of real average earnings as the criterion of the success or failure of the accord in controlling income growth in Australia over the last 7 1/2 years-was in fact contributed to by the wages pause of the former Government. That change, I remind the House, was strenuously opposed by the Prime Minister as the then Labor Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, as well as by many other senior members of the present Government. So perhaps the first myth in this debate which ought to be disposed of is the myth that all the real wage restraint that has occurred over the last 7 1/2 years has been entirely due to the constraining effects of the prices and incomes accord. </PARA>
<PARA> The second myth that ought to be dealt with in relation to the accord is the contribution it has made to a reduction in strikes and industrial disputes over the last 7 1/2 years. There has been a reduction in strikes and industrial disputes over the last 7 1/2 years; there has been a reduction not only in Australia but also in just about every comparable country around the world. The fact is that all countries and all industrial relations systems, whether they have been centralised or decentralised, have been mugged by the reality of the 1980s. The wisdom gained from the industrial experience of the 1970s is that excessive wage demands normally produce higher unemployment, plummeting profits, lower investment and general economic stagnation. That economic reality has been grasped and responded to around the world, whether by decentralised or centralised wage-fixing approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> It ill behoves the Prime Minister-and lately the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has also been guilty of this-when comparing the industrial relations record of his Government with that of the former Government constantly to choose as the year representative of the former Government's performance the twelve months to 30 June 1982. Why does he not use the period to 30 June 1983? The former Government was in office for eight-twelfths of that year, not his Government. I will tell the House why he does not use that period: the comparison is not nearly as good. In fact, if one compares that last year with the period he normally invokes in relation to his own prime ministership, one finds there is not a great deal of difference at all. That is another myth that ought to be dispatched. </PARA>
<PARA> The third myth that ought to be dispatched is one that has been around for a very long time. It is brought very much back into play by the current wages campaign of the ACTU. The myth is that the wages break-out that occurred in 1981-82 was the result of an exercise in implementing the industrial relations policy which is now embraced by the Opposition parties. That is one of the great canards and myths of the industrial relations debate in Australia. What happened in 1981 was that a collectively bargained agreement in the metal industry between the unions and the industry was subsequently enshrined as an award through the imprimatur of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and under the principle of comparative wage justice. That agreement flowed through the entire economy; firms within, first, the metal industry and then throughout the entire economy were forced to comply with the terms of that agreement whether they had the economic capacity to do so or not. </PARA>
<PARA> That was not by any tortuous use of the English language an exercise in enterprise bargaining of the type that we now espouse; rather, it was an exercise in collective bargaining on an industry-wide basis. What we are now talking about and what the end product of our industrial relations policy would be is a situation where bargains are struck at an enterprise level according to the circumstances, the capacity and the need of individual enterprises. We believe that through that approach it is possible to maximise productivity improvements and to strike arrangements whereby workers receive real income gains in return for productivity improvements enjoyed by their firms, to the ultimate benefit not only of their profits but also total national productivity. It is ironic that what is now being engaged in by the ACTU is an attempt to secure compliance at an industry wide level-I stress that-and not enterprise level of agreements with employers. That is in fact a re-run of what occurred in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on the question of the current wages campaign of the ACTU, let me repeat what I said in this House only two days ago during consideration of the estimates of the Department of Industrial Relations: I take no fright at all at the campaign being run by the ACTU. I do not agree with its strategy; it is a collective bargaining strategy, whereas I am for an enterprise bargaining strategy. But what I would say generally to employers and those who may follow this debate is that the campaign by the ACTU provides a window of opportunity for many individual employers to go to either their unions or their work forces and say, `Well, if you really want some direct bargaining, let us have it on an enterprise level.' I point to the example of the deal by ICI Australia Ltd with the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia which has apparently returned a significant productivity gain in return for an equally significant wage increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely that is what we should all be about. It is wrong for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to repeatedly say, as they do with monotonous regularity during Question Time-and the Treasurer put on a very over-the-top performance today-that we are opposed to real income gains. We are not. The most distinguishing feature of the industrial relations policy of the Opposition is that it is based upon a goal of improving the real incomes of Australian employees. The only way that these real incomes can be improved is through an improvement in productivity. Having acknowledged, as I must in all objectivity, that the prices and incomes accord has helped to deliver a reduction in real wages and, through that, to make some contribution to the restoration of profit share and to employment growth, it has been an abysmal failure on the productivity front and it has also made a very undistinguished contribution to the fight against inflation in this country. In fact, it is fair to say that the prices and incomes accord has put a floor under Australia's inflation record and has made a significant contribution to the growth of our current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in years to come, when an economic history is written of the 1980s, it will be recorded that in return for purchasing a reduction in real wages, the prices and incomes accord helped to underwrite the unsustainable expansion of Australia's current account deficit during the 1980s. The Prime Minister is fond of reminding us, as is the Treasurer, that we have a current account deficit because there is a gap between production and expenditure, and because we do not save enough domestically, we must go abroad to borrow the savings of foreigners to finance the excess consumption. The Prime Minister is fond of reminding us of that economic reality-and he is right to do so. But he is wrong not to recognise that the low productivity, more than the excessive expenditure, is the real culprit in the 1980s. It is a poor second choice to take the path of crunching the life out of expenditure as a method of closing the gap, rather than to adopt economic reforms that are likely to boost productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> So in assessing the contribution of the prices and incomes accord, it has to be recorded as a significant black mark against it that it has helped to underwrite the excessively high inflation rate that Australia has. In case anybody regards that as an exaggeration and in case anyone believes that nominal inflation rates are the only things that count, I draw the attention of the House to a very valuable document which was released at a press conference today by the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI). It is entitled Australia in the 1980's-An International Ranking of Economies. It is a very interesting document. It starts in 1980, not surprisingly, and it ends in 1989-because it is about the 1980s. It goes through each of the years of the 1980s and it has a table of 10 nations: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Every kind of country is there, with the possible exception of the north Asian economies, which may be a little under-represented. There are the traditional industrial economies and also the Valhalla of all true believers in central planning, Sweden, which appears to be doing very poorly at present, and of course, for regional purposes there is New Zealand, as well as, naturally, the powerhouses of Germany and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> The CAI has taken a number of criteria with which to measure economic performance. It has taken per capita change in GDP, the change in the investment rate, the unemployment rate, the trade deficit, and the changes in the consumer price index. One of the interesting things about the table is that if one looks at the comparisons on inflation, one finds that in the 10 years of the 1980s there were only two years in which, in comparative terms, Australia, in that 10 nation comparison, was in the best half of those 10 countries. Those two years, it may surprise people to know, were 1980 and 1981. In fact, in 1988 on that scale of the 10-nation comparison, this country came dead last when it came to inflationary performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting thing, which is very relevant to the contribution of the prices and incomes accord, is what this document says about unemployment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The data in the table show the ranking by unemployment rate. What is clearly apparent is the consistency across the years in the rate of unemployment for most economies. </PARA>
<PARA>That sits a little oddly with the shrill rhetoric of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that Australia, alone under their Government, has delivered remarkable reductions in unemployment. The document goes on to make another very significant observation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The greatest variation, and in many ways the greatest achievement on this economic objective, is the change in the unemployment rate in the United States from eighth place in 1980 to third place by 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very significant because of all the countries in that group of 10, none has a more deregulated labour market than the United States. The United States has the most flexible deregulated labour market of all countries in that 10-nation list. The CAI is saying that on that comparison the nation with the most deregulated labour market has achieved the most impressive performance on the unemployment front. When one takes into account the very significant urban under-class of people who, tragically, are unemployable in the major cities of the United States, one has an idea of how impressive that performance by the United States on the unemployment front has really been. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, in a sense, contributes to the dispatch of myth No. 4 in the industrial relations debate-that in some way, the accord has delivered miraculous achievements on the inflation and the unemployment front. I acknowledge that there has been an employment growth in Australia over the last few years. I acknowledge that there has been a real wage fall. I make the point that almost half of that real wage fall flowed from the wages pause of late 1982, but I make the entirely appropriate additional points that the accord has helped to underwrite an inflation rate which, in comparative terms, has been truly appalling during the seven years of the Hawke Government-an unemployment record which has been nowhere near as distinguished as that of the United States, with a deregulated labour market approach. Of course, overlaying all of that we have seen an unsustainable expansion of the current account deficit during those years. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, at Question Time the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are fond of running this line: `We have this structural problem because you fellows opposite during the 1950s and 1960s presided over a situation in which we did not produce enough to pay for all of the things that we wanted to spend our money on, or you did not supply the things that we wanted to spend our money on, and we had to import savings from overseas'. I simply make the point that ought to be made again and again when that line is brought up: if that is the case, why was our gross overseas debt $24,179m in 1983, yet in 1989 it was $137,046m?</PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that it has gone from 14.7 per cent to 38 per cent of gross domestic product? If we had imported such large volumes of savings from foreigners prior to 1983, why was that figure only 14.7 per cent? If honourable members opposite have been doing such a brilliant job over the last 7 1/2 years, why has that figure climbed to 38.4 per cent? These are relevant issues and they go to the very heart of the economic and industrial relations debate which is being conducted in Australia at present. It behoves everybody in this House to examine some of the objective criteria rather than to indulge in some of the shrill rhetoric which has become, unfortunately, the stock in trade of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, particularly at Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said on other occasions in this Parliament that another myth of industrial relations in Australia is that there has always been a great divide between the Liberal and National parties on the one hand and the Australian Labor Party on the other hand. Of course, that was not the case until 1986. Until 1986, despite any rhetoric to the contrary, both the Opposition and Government parties basically believed in a centralised wage fixing system with the Industrial Relations Commission sitting at the very pinnacle. </PARA>
<PARA> But in 1986 the National and Liberal parties for the first time overturned over 80 years of industrial relations tradition in this country-dating from the Harvester decision back in 1908-when we embraced for the first time the belief that the pinnacle of industrial relations ought to be the voluntary agreement between individual owners and individual employees; when we embraced the belief that a contract freely made between free men and women was more likely than any other industrial relations agreement to produce productivity improvements to the benefit of both employees and owners; when we embraced the belief that the real interests of Australian employers lay in encouraging the individual to work harder for a greater reward. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that the sole criterion by which I am happy to have the industrial relations policy of the Liberal and National parties judged is the benefit that it confers upon both the employees of this country and the national economic welfare. Ours is not a policy of slashing real wages; ours is not a policy designed simply for its own sake to reduce the power of trade unions-although our policy holds very strongly to the view that, although the trade union movement has a legitimate and central role in the fabric of Australian life, it is not and ought never to be part and parcel of the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The industrial relations debate is changing. It is changing in favour of the philosophy that lay behind the policy espoused by the Liberal and National parties as far back as 1986. It was a rather more lonely exercise then than it is now. But support has been gathered. More and more people are talking about the need to have a flexible, decentralised wage fixing system. The tide of history is against a centralised approach. The challenge of the trade union movement in the 1990s will not be so much to win political and industrial battles with the future government of this country; rather, it will be to retain its position as a legitimate spokesman for the employees of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, as I speak, the total private sector membership of trade unions in Australia is no more than 32 per cent. Were it not for the de facto compulsory unionism that exists in the public sector, which has the effect of bumping up the overall average, the total average of people in trade unions would be close to that figure of 32 per cent. The challenge of union leadership in the 1990s will be to retain members. The challenge of the trade unions will be to preserve their legitimate position as spokesmen for the employees of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> During the committee stage of the debate, I and others will be speaking to the amendment that we seek to insert in this Bill, but this debate provides the House with an opportunity to soberly analyse both the role and contribution of the prices and incomes accord to the economic and industrial life in this country over the last 10 years and the relative industrial relations approaches now on offer-and, hopefully, to analyse them free of the blustering, irrational, misleading rhetoric which has become so much the stock-in-trade of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I was not late at all. He talked very much around the issue, but did not deal too much with the substance of the issue we are concerned with. That is not too surprising when we consider that one of the key provisions of this Bill is award observance in the area of superannuation. One can well understand why the Opposition would not want to talk too much about award superannuation coverage. The honourable member for Bennelong talked at length about his view of industrial relations-indeed, he attempted to rewrite the history of the late 1970s and early 1980s-and then said that, as far as the Opposition is concerned, it will be a different regime if and when it comes back into office. What he then went on to say was really a rehash of what he was part of administering in the 1970s and 1980s. He suggested that the Opposition's policies, particularly in the area of superannuation coverage, have not deviated too much at all from that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting when one looks at superannuation coverage that a great reform has been achieved in the development of our superannuation coverage in Australia. Award superannuation now reaches about 80 per cent of the national work force. It is a phenomenal change from 1982-83 when it was below 50 per cent; it was 45 per cent in 1982. Opposition members can say all they like about industrial relations. But if they do not think that that is good for the national interest, that it is good to establish an effective retirement incomes policy to ensure that all people, irrespective of their station in life, get a decent opportunity for retirement with which they can feel secure and comfortable, I think they are very much on the wrong track. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this Government has a lot to be proud of and to boast about in the area of the extension of superannuation coverage. It would be better for Opposition members to acknowledge those positive achievements in a constructive way than to seek, as they did, to attack the Australian Council of Trade Unions leadership, the ACTU as a whole and the trade unions as a whole and to say that the real problems in industrial relations in this country stem from the scorn that is poured by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). What arrant nonsense that is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member refers to Question Time today. I would not have thought that a member of the Opposition would want to talk too much about Question Time after today's experience. The assessment that most of us would make is that the Opposition's tactics committee needs to review its tactics after the form of questions that were asked. Be that as it may, the important issues that were reflected in Question Time today and also in the discussion that has gone on this afternoon on this Bill contrast sharply our approach of fairness, of seeking in superannuation coverage to have award compliance in this particular Bill and to ensure that the needs of people are addressed effectively by government, with that of our opponents who say, `Let's have this free for all. Let the people with particular needs head down to the voluntary agencies because they are the only point of call that they will have for any sort of assistance'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We reject that sort of approach and I believe that the Australian community quite rightly rejects it. The honourable member for Bennelong talked about the number of myths that he believed abounded through the accord. I would suggest the greatest myth that is perpetuated in this place in debate about industrial relations and our economy is the myth that the deregulated labour market is somehow going to magically produce all of these wonderful things that the honourable member for Bennelong talked about. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know what we need in industrial relations. Everybody I talk to wants predictability, certainty and a degree of stability in the process. It is acknowledged by all, even the most ardent critics of the Government, that our industrial relations policy has been very successful in delivering the objective of certainty, and in ensuring that wage outcomes are commensurate with national interest objectives. It has had the support and the real commitment of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> It strikes me as really odd that the Opposition continues to froth at the mouth about the prospects of getting stuck into the ACTU, when the ACTU leadership-particularly Bill Kelty-has conducted what can only be described as an extremely responsible and very credible, orderly and nationally conscious approach to its dealings with government and employers throughout the seven and a half years of this Government. Why should the ACTU be condemned all the time? What is the reason; what is the motivation-other than some blind ideology? Opposition members constantly come in here and condemn and ridicule the responsible leadership that our trade union movement has given. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong also said that the accord in some respects delivered some benefits, but he claimed to be concerned for the well-being of Australian workers. He suggested that those who spoke up for the accord were not necessarily supporting the objective of concern for the well-being of Australian workers. I can only say that I remember what conditions were like in 1982-83. We did not hear the honourable member for Bennelong talk about the fact that we had double-digit inflation and double-digit unemployment when he left office. We did not hear about the massive deficit that he left for the Labor Government at that time. Rather, we were told that things were really made right for us by his achievements at the very latter stages of the wages pause. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, unemployment-particularly among youth-was more than 25 per cent in many areas such as the western suburbs of Sydney, which I represent. People in those areas would have had enormous difficulty then in accepting that the Opposition's policy was about concern for the well-being of all Australian workers. They would laugh at that proposition now. On any sort of objective analysis, it is clear that the industrial relations approach that has been applied under this Government has been successful in ensuring that 1.6 million new jobs have been created. We have also ensured that, as part of the process, there is real fiscal policy management and that is why we have had the successive surpluses. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong talked about levels of inflation. It is worth noting that our inflation rate is falling, and has been falling consistently for the last three to four quarters. At the same time, the honourable member for Bennelong gave an international comparison. He did not mention the current inflation rate in Britain. I wonder why he did not mention that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that the honourable member opposite made an international comparison and suggested, on the basis of that international comparison, that we were somehow worse off because of this Government's economic management. I reject that sort of suggestion out of hand. If one looks at what has been achieved in terms of our economic performance and the fiscal restraint with equity that we have shown, particularly in relation to effective targeting of our social policy network so that those people who need the security of government in one form or another receive it, one will recognise that it is a worthy and excellent model for other countries to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at our retirement incomes policy, one will see that that policy is an absolutely phenomenal achievement. We would have all been better off if the conservative governments of the 1950s and 1960s had actually been concerned enough to ensure that all workers got superannuation coverage. It is just a pity that superannuation was not on the Opposition's agenda. It was not seen as part of the Opposition's important agenda at that time. Why? Because the people it represented were getting it anyway. The people covered by the award process were not able to get access to it because those who were supporting the Opposition did not see that as a work force prerogative. It is about time and long overdue that the Opposition actually recognised the value and importance of that superannuation initiative that has been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation reflects the ongoing determination of the Government to ensure our industrial relations laws are relevant and carefully attuned to the significant growth in superannuation coverage for the Australian work force. Despite the fact that we have established the award superannuation provision, it is clear that some employers are not effectively meeting their commitments under that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong said at the outset that, if this were the law, he accepted that people had to comply with it. But I would like to say for the benefit of the House that it is not only a case of people complying with the law; it is also a case of establishing an ethos that says that all of us are concerned to ensure that retirement income is planned, orderly and something that people can look forward to. The majority of workers, particularly those who, because of late entry into superannuation under awards, might have only 10 or 15 years coverage, will still be faced with difficulties unless a real ethos develops that employers are willing to comply with. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the majority of employers obviously do seek to meet their obligations in that regard. I do not say that they necessarily all welcome it, but the amendments proposed to be made in this legislation are designed to improve the operation-particularly in the area of that award observance. Although most employers-especially those who are properly informed about their award obligations through membership of an effective employer association-observe awards, breaches are too common. In the past financial year, inspectors appointed under the Act detected more than 20,000 breaches. About 17,500 of these were monetary breaches and more than $4m was recovered. Most breaches are voluntarily rectified, but regrettably legal action is frequently required. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments here are being proposed to assist in securing the observance of awards in the interests of employers, workers and the community generally. One of the difficulties, particularly in some smaller operations, is just being able to pass on the level of information that is needed so that people can meet their obligations as employers-and I am not suggesting that they all wilfully ignore those obligations. However, I would say that we have an obligation, through the system, to overcome ignorance and uncertainty, and the amendments are designed to facilitate that process. </PARA>
<PARA> This is to be achieved by establishing means to supplement for short periods the number of inspectors who secure award observance, providing for action to be taken under the Act to bring about the observance of award provisions requiring their payment of superannuation contributions on behalf of employees, widening the range of persons who may bring proceedings relating to the non-observance of award obligations and ensuring that better employment records are kept. All these are objectives which, I suggest, nobody in the House could really dispute. Under the Act, inspectors have a primary role in securing the observance of awards made by the Industrial Relations Commission. At present, only persons employed or appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 may be inspectors. It is proposed to permit the appointment of other persons for a fixed term with such inspectors powers as may be specified. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will permit short term peak workloads to be met more satisfactorily. In addition, it will enable persons with specialised qualifications to be appointed for particular tasks, for example where highly technical areas of work are involved. Those persons will be obliged to exercise their powers in good faith and with the same integrity as permanent inspectors under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the available evidence, including data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, suggests that a substantial minority of employers are not meeting their obligations in this area. In some cases this may be as a result of ignorance, as I said before. The Government has developed, in consultation with the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, a national strategy to deal with the problem, including educative and information components and appropriate award inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases legal proceedings under the Act may be necessary. A difficulty has arisen, however, in relation to the enforcement of award provisions requiring the payment by an employer of an amount on behalf of employees to a superannuation fund. Under the Act, where an award requires an employer to make a payment to an employee the court may order the payment to be made. This does not, however, apply to a contribution required to be paid by an employer on behalf of an employee to a superannuation fund rather than to the employee concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In consultations on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) the Confederation of Australian Industry has not agreed that a court should be able to order the payment of any amount in addition to unpaid superannuation contributions in proceedings to rectify their non-payment. However, I think most would agree that it would be unfair to exclude the possibility of a total restitution. Indeed, the minority of employers who deliberately refuse to meet their obligations could merely be encouraged to avoid making such contributions when they are due. It should also be noted that it will be for a court to decide what amounts should be paid where a failure to make the required payments has been established. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reform is proposed to the provisions of the Act under which penalties may be imposed for award breaches under which employees may recover amounts due to them. At present, because of the wording of the Act an employer who is not a member of a federally registered union does not have access to the provision of sections 178 and 179 which permit a court to order the payment of amounts due under an award. Yet in many ways the non-unionised work force is more vulnerable to such award breaches. It is unacceptable for an employer to be able to evade proceedings under the Act which compel compliance with award obligations simply because a worker does not belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is proposed to revise the wording of the relevant provisions to allow workers who do not belong to a union to use the more practical and convenient remedies under the Act to recover amounts owing to them under awards. I suggest that those provisions and the other items that are contained in the legislation relating to some extensions of coverage dealing with the Defence Act 1903, the amendments to the Industrial Relations (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 and also amendments relating to the Australian Federal Police staff and the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Act 1986, are all, on any fair assessment, ones that ensure that the industrial relations arrangements that apply in this country are effective, workable, and ensure certainty and predictability. </PARA>
<PARA> When they are taken into account with the other legislation which is in the other place at the moment relating to the Government's desire to reduce the number of trade unions and to orient those unions more with an industry focus in a number of cases, all of those measures will ensure the continuing importance and the continuing worth of our industrial relations system which sees the value of the Industrial Relations Commission and the various components that make it up. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing has been said by the honourable member for Bennelong which contradicts the fact that the relevance of superannuation coverage in particular and the importance of ensuring that those people who rely and will rely increasingly on superannuation have the full benefits passed onto them. This amendment will help to ensure that that obligation is met by employers. That is something that is in our collective national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, on any assessment that is made I think one has to come to the conclusion that if we deregulate the labour market there are some on the union side who will be immensely strengthened but there are an awful lot who in the process will be dramatically weakened. I think it is a failing of the Opposition that when it talks about deregulating the market it fails to note that areas such as superannuation coverage which have been extended so massively in a deregulated labour market would not exist. They would not have become a reality under the scenario that the honourable member for Bennelong outlines now any more than they became a reality under the proposals that he talked about and implemented in his time in office from 1975 to 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> We only have to look at the collective record in terms of superannuation coverage to see the stark contrast in our achievement as a Labor Government in extending award based superannuation coverage for the vast majority of Australians, compared to the fact that it was kept as something that was the prerogative of a select few during the Liberal Party's past times in government. That was quite deliberate on its part and it stands in very sharp and distinct contrast with the way we approach such matters because we believe in proper retirement incomes policies. We believe in ensuring that it is fair for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with other members who have spoken in this debate I would like to confine my remarks to those clauses of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which deal with the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his second reading speech the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) noted that the amendments to be made are to improve the Act's operation, particularly in the area of observance, the operative word being `observance'. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Amendments are being proposed which will assist in securing the observance of awards in the interests of employers, workers and the community generally.</PARA>
<PARA>I had intended to read out the amendments, but the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) has done a good job of that; so it seems particularly unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I want to make is that every amendment proposed will further secure observance of awards but only in the interests of the workers. It is typical of this Labor Government that it uses the stick approach to policy setting rather than the carrot. Whereas on this side of the House we use incentives and encouragement and talk about providing opportunities, the Government and the Australian Labor Party are inclined to use coercion and force in order to obtain their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> An example that I might note is the newly introduced and operative industry training levy legislation. All members would be aware that through Government legislation we now require employers to donate a portion of their wages expenditure to be spent on training or else donate it to the Government in the form of a tax. The Government has not used an approach to encourage employers into further training schemes. Everyone in this country must agree that we have a dramatic and well-stated need for expanded training opportunities for everyone in the work place in the last years of this century and into the next century if we are going to accomplish anything in terms of improving productivity and improving our national wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> We agree that we need training, but the point that I want to make is that in common with this Bill is the fact that it is the Government's approach to use the stick and to force people in this case to observe awards rather than offer encouragement for people to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta made a statement during his speech regarding the people who we on this side of the House represent. I would like to say to the honourable member for Parramatta that the Liberal and National parties represent the workers in this country, the families in this country, the aged in this country and the youth in this country. I say to the honourable member that after the next election he will find out to his detriment that that is true. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has foreshadowed an amendment to this Bill which I would like to commend to this House and which is most sensible. The intent of the amendment is to incorporate into the Industrial Relations Act 1988 a private member's Bill proposed by then Senator Chaney, now the honourable member for Pearce, which will give balance to the Industrial Relations Act. Do Government members understand the word `balance'? Realistically, the Industrial Relations Commission has a great deal of power when it comes to the control of employee and employer actions, but it is a toothless tiger when it comes to ensuring that union members or union organisations conform to the rules or the judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta talked about conforming to the rules. I agree. If we are going to have superannuation in the awards, employers should observe the rules. There is no question; that is a fair statement. On the other side of the debate, though, it is our contention that the Bill gives a great deal in terms of rights to union organisations, but no rights to employers. When it comes to ensuring that union members or union organisations conform to the rules or the judgment, the Industrial Relations Act 1988 is not democratic. It gives power to the Commission to direct employees but that power, under the Act and under the interpretation of the Act, is toothless. The Commission cannot and does not force unions to adhere to awards or to discontinue action even when they are so directed. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on the Australian economy unambiguously and strongly criticised our centralised wage system in the process of fixing terms and conditions of employment in multi-employer awards which, it says, `impede change and limit adaptability'. The Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems recommended that parties should be able to opt out of the centralised system. The Committee indicated that parties should be entitled directly to negotiate settlement of any industrial dispute and their agreement would therefore displace existing awards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate that I reiterate comments made in this House by the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong, setting out coalition policy on industrial relations reform, when he spoke at the committee stage of the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 earlier this week. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties' view of industrial relations is that the employers and employees of this country should essentially have three options. They can, if they so wish, remain within the centralised wage fixation system and governed by the terms of awards laid down by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and flowing through by order of the various State industrial tribunals. As a second option, they can take advantage of section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act that was inserted in the amendments in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The third very important element of our approach to industrial relations is the voluntary agreement. We believe that the way of the future is to encourage individual owners and their workers to go outside the constraints of the award system and to make their own bargains in the way in which the Power Brewing company in Queensland did. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, in my view, section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act allows a form of collective bargaining only in very strictly limited circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several limitations on the operation of section 115. The first of those is that a public interest test must be treated as a serious limitation. In fact, the Business Council of Australia has made constant demands for the removal of this requirement. Section 115 must also be read subject to section 90 of the Industrial Relations Act which provides that, when performing its functions under the legislation, the Commission must take into account the objects of the Act and the state of the national economy. So we cannot have a collective bargaining element in the industrial relations stream because the entire economy of the nation must be taken into account. We really go back to centralisation again, do we not?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also has to be satisfied that any agreement is, firstly, justified on its merits; secondly, related to circumstances of a special and isolated nature; and, thirdly, is not a device to circumvent general wage fixing principles or threaten the orderly operation of the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> For some reason-it is not particularly clear to me, at any rate-the Australian Labor Party has convinced itself-or perhaps the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has done the convincing-that centralised wage fixing is an appropriate mechanism for assuring employees of social justice, whatever that means, and as a mechanism for helping to control inflation. Honest to goodness, how on earth one controls inflation with a centralised bureaucratic system is beyond my imagination. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we seen since this Government came to power and since an accord was established with the Australian Council of Trade Unions-which I know is a bureaucracy unto itself? We have a bureaucracy, the ACTU, in partnership with what should be a government, which controls another bureaucracy. Together, in concert, they decide what employers in this country are going to pay everybody and what conditions of employment we are going to have across the entire breadth of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> All of that is supposed to control inflation and keep it at a low level. I am here to tell honourable members that the results that the honourable member for Bennelong gave to us this evening, certainly from the table from which he read, indicate, as every report that I have read indicates, that our inflation rate over the term of this Labor Government has run at several times the inflation rate of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> I inform the honourable member for Parramatta that in recent years union membership in the United States has declined from 40 per cent, 35 per cent, to 16 per cent, and in that country the whole system of industrial relations has changed from centralised bargaining to a series of independent agreements between employers and employees. Within that structure the kind of arrangements they have come to have allowed individual employees in one company to structure their own payment in terms of a package with the boss. So employee A, for instance, might have a high wage and a very low social package, so that he does not get a car, he does not have an ability to bring his child to work to be looked after in a child minding facility and perhaps he does not have paid health insurance. Employee B decides, `I want a low wage, but I want a lot of other things in the package. I want child minding, superannuation at a very high contribution rate and I want health insurance paid for by my employer'. So the employer is able to accommodate employee A and employee B, structuring the work so that all these archaic and unbelievable work practices that we live with in much of industry in this country are eliminated. Productivity would be high, the employee would be happy and the employee would receive the portion of the company's profits that are attributable to his efforts. The company receives what is left and national productivity is very high. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolute common sense. What happens under that kind of mechanism is that inflation can truly be lowered because nobody is controlling wages. We have this great myth that has been built up since the early 1900s that somehow men and women who work together cannot achieve objective outcomes without having an intermediary decide for them what is right and proper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is absolutely ridiculous. We are all adults in this world. Yes, I agree that the workers in this country have the right to form unions and that they have the right to have unions represent them in their workplace. But honest to goodness, the concept that the people in a company cannot sit down with the people who own the company and decide what is appropriate in the current circumstances for their wages or their conditions is, as I said earlier, arrant nonsense. We are mature people and it is time we acted in a mature and responsible manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week the Minister for Science and Technology said in this House:</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 7 1/2 years this Government has changed industrial relations from a reactive discipline in which the focus of attention was on how we solved messes, disputes, once they had happened, to a pro-active role in which we have tried to develop a positive approach by which labour market policies can be used to actually drive the economy in the direction of competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read that about five times and I have a great deal of difficulty comprehending what on earth the Minister was trying to say; but I can tell the House that there is no possibility that the approach of this Government to industrial relations, in partnership with the ACTU, has done one single dot's worth of anything towards increasing competitiveness in Australia. We have gone backwards, honourable members, we have gone backwards. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, if we have even a brief look at the debt the country has piled up under this Treasurer (Mr Keating) and this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), it should be obvious to everyone that the accord has to go, that centralised wage fixing has to go, or that as a nation we are going to go because we are going to be well and truly broke. If our debts increase at the current rate, they are going to reach the proportion where we are not going to be able to service them and so the debtor is going to call in the bill. When he does, that is called bankruptcy. I remind the Treasurer that that really is what insolvency is all about. It is not the cash flow that he was trying to lay on Mr Nobby Clark. Insolvency is when one is broke, and that is just about what this nation is. I quote again the Minister for Science and Technology:</PARA>
<PARA> We have focused on getting labour market reform, ensuring that wages policy works in the overall interests of the fiscal and monetary policy settings of the Government, but at the same time driving reform at the micro-or enterprise level of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Goodness me, it is this side of the House that is talking about voluntary enterprise agreements. It is this side of the House that has brought to the attention of the public the possibility that even in Australia we can sit down as adults, in a sensible manner, and negotiate wages and conditions of employment. It is the Labor side of the House-the Government side of the House-that still argues for centralisation. I fail to understand how on earth the Government can drive its reform at an enterprise level when in fact the Act we are discussing here, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, is a centralised wage control mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta commented that we would have no superannuation for workers in this country if this House took up our proposal and deregulated the labour market. Let us examine that because it really does not make much sense-at least it does not to me.  Perhaps it does in terms of Labor Party stick versus Liberal Party carrot. In that context perhaps it does make sense because what the honourable member for Parramatta was saying was that if employers are not forced to give superannuation then the workers will not get it. </PARA>
<PARA> We say: let the employers and the employees negotiate together freely in an atmosphere of assistance, an atmosphere of cooperation, an atmosphere where the Government is encouraging rather than forcing. What we will do is increase productivity in this nation, and perhaps we can start to redress our massive debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst this legislation covers a number of matters, my principal interest is in those relating to the increased enforcement procedures that the Government intends to impose on business through the Industrial Relations Act. Of course, that is what we are talking about today: further regulation of the labour market, particularly as it applies to occupational superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government had come in here today with a piece of legislation requiring the trade unions to send annual statements on the status of their members' superannuation entitlements, I would be very supportive. But at this time most of those who have been involved in occupational superannuation for a couple of years would find that, compared with the contributions forcibly made by their employers, they have very little. The dollars accruing to the workers would be less than 50 per cent of the contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Over time, I guess the interest will gradually catch up, but I have had cases brought to my attention, particularly in the more seasonal industries such as shearing and so on, where people have seen their money go in and they have demanded and fought and scratched to get statements on their current situation and then found that there was only a fraction of that money there. Honourable members know why. A bit has to go out to the trade union-$1 in $11, as I recollect; fees are charged by everybody, including stamp duties by State governments. All in all, there is very little left for the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we get carried away with this wonderful deal on what superannuation means to Australia and the massive increase in savings that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) boasts about, let us remember what the Australian Council of Trade Unions said about the performance of superannuation companies. It suggested government should have control of at least 20 per cent of the money to direct its investment. I think I heard something on the radio this morning about the extent to which those superannuation companies are finding it necessary to invest Australians' savings overseas to get anything like an adequate return on the money. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe that is the circle we should be following. Why can those companies not invest in Australia and get a reasonable return on their money? Might it just be that when we set out to build a large investment building for AMP the cost blows out through bad work practice, strikes, and all the delays that are now inherent in our building industry? Maybe that is the reason the AMP and other large investment companies of that nature find it necessary to invest outside Australia. Maybe there are some good reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The first charge against occupational superannuation-notwithstanding all the claims, and they quote 10, 15, 20 per cent return on funds invested-is not the funds contributed by the employer but the little bit that is left after everybody has had a share of it. If we made that calculation, we would find that the return was minimal and that many workers could do better by putting it in the bank. I guess the question is: would they put it in the bank?</PARA>
<PARA> That is the first point about this legislation, which is all about using government resources to go out and persecute employers to ensure that they are maintaining the laws of the land. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, we respect the law and we believe that everybody should comply with the law. That is the fundamental reason for the amendments we have put forward.  We think it is about time in the industrial relations jungle that either both sides were in the jungle or both sides were out on the flat. As it is now, the trade union bureaucrat is entitled to reside in the jungle and shoot every employer who has to walk out on the flat. That is not fair. That is not Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of our amendments today, which will be debated in committee, is to say to those in the Government, and to the Australian Democrats-who believe they have some special right in terms of fairness, honesty and all those things that are supposed to be good in politics-that they should consider the fairness of saying to a court we have established, in regard to an Act we have established, that if a judge tells somebody to do something he should have the power to back it up. We are debating a bit of legislation because a gap has been found: that maybe the industrial arbitration inspectors-employees of the Government-or trade union officials, in pursuing employers who have failed in some way to meet award conditions, may have some difficulty in succeeding in court. We are now debating whether that matter should be resolved. We say it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> But we live in a time when, if a trade union breaks the law or ignores the instruction of an arbitration commissioner, the commissioner can do nothing about it. There are punishment provisions for employers, not for employees-or, more importantly, those trade union bureaucrats who claim to act on their behalf, notwithstanding that they represent less than about 40 per cent of the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked at the second reading speech and I am interested to see that some 20,000 breaches were identified by government inspectors. I hope that in his response the Minister will mention something about the 2,500 that were not monetary breaches. I hope he will remember one of those breaches in recent times. An inspector found a clothing factory where the workers, who were married women, had gone to the boss to point out to him that they were having difficulty with their kids. Their kids had become latchkey kids because mum was getting home after they got home from school because her working hours precluded her from getting home before the kids got home from school, and some of the kids were getting into trouble. It was not the boss that did anything about that; the workers went along and said, `We have a plan. We would like to start work a little bit earlier, miss smoko-because we do not think it is really necessary and it is doing nothing for our diet-we will take half an hour for lunch and, with that accumulated time, we will knock off early and be home before the kids'. The employer agreed. He got the same productivity and he accommodated his work force. A government arbitration inspector came into his work place and said, `This is illegal and it must stop'. That is one of the 2,500 breaches that the Minister mentions out of the 20,000. That is a breach and it is persecuted with great vigour by these sorts of idiots that are employed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister might also tell me how many breaches of existing legislation were identified by these inspectors in terms of the auditing of the accounts of trade unions. The Minister might remember that when this Government pulled out the Industrial Relations Bureau it was embarrassed by the fact that an audit section was included in that Bureau. In fact, when the Government did away with that legislation it left the audit section legislation in place. It then shifted out all the workers so there is no-one there to audit the books of account of these trade unions. Of course, there is an inquiry going on in Queensland that provides pretty clear evidence as to how the subscriptions of good hardworking people have been handled by certain trade union bureaucrats. The Government is not prepared to use the laws available to protect the funds of workers but it wants to come in here now and tell everybody that further penalties must be placed upon employers in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> If those opposite want to do that, we will not stop them. We will support them in putting proper provisions in place to support their industrial relations law. But we say, while they are about it, let us have some proper provisions to see that trade unionists and, more importantly, their trade union bureaucrats who have breached the instructions of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are also subject to penalty. There does not seem to be too much wrong with that. That is a straightforward, fair dinkum Aussie principle: a fair go for all. It is about time the Government, which claims such a degree of fairness, considered that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta gave us the usual sort of furphies. Is it not amazing? Very shortly now the Treasurer of Australia will tell us that the recession that is upon us is all the fault of the fall in rural commodity prices. He will be telling us that just as he told us some years ago about the crash in the terms of trade. That was the time they were blaming the foreigners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Nevertheless, when the Treasurer talks about the circumstances of 1982-83-and the honourable member for Parramatta was at pains to tell us about 25 per cent youth unemployment-the drought of 1982-83, which was a drought on production, which is no different from a fall in prices, is invisible to the Treasurer. He has referred to that on only one occasion in this Parliament since he has been Treasurer. But he will make that excuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A similar excuse is that those on the other side suddenly want to compare the numbers on inflation and talk about our double-digit inflation. It existed; we do not deny it. But it was comparable with inflation in every part of the world and it was much closer to the figures for other countries than has ever been the case under this Government. It is about time the Government stopped generating that myth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer talked about the strong and the weak. We are now being told that we have a form of enterprise bargaining under the new legislation of this Government and occasionally we hear the snide remark, `Look how that is working; look how they are belting hell out of the employers'. If we have an environment where the right to strike is totally unlimited, how can we have negotiation? How can we have negotiation while one side says, `If you do not like what I am going to give you, I will send you broke?'. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which we have presented today recognise that. The original speech in the second reading debate in the Senate by Senator Chaney pointed out that time is the essence in these dealings. It is too easy for a trade union to take someone out of business for even a fortnight. The business, of course, goes broke, misses a contract commitment or something else. An employer cannot afford it. Naturally that is not the regime that we anticipate when we talk about an enterprise bargaining system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the trade union bureaucrats went out and explained what they mean. Just before I get on to some of the proposals that we would give to those in the Australian work force in their interests, let me remind the house that in the dispute with the pilots Justice Brooking of the Victorian Supreme Court made it very clear that every strike is a breach of contract and is therefore illegal. That is what he found and that is the situation. This Government refuses point-blank to put a penalty on that breach but it wants to go out and persecute the individual who, maybe through lack of knowledge, has not paid into the super fund-to say nothing, of course, for a small enterprise, of the complexity of sending off $2 or $3 or $5 each week. When farmers, for example, have itinerant workers come onto their properties for shearing, the situation is absolutely crazy. Many will never see the money. They get $10 here and $20 there, they work for a couple of months and then they do not work any more; they might just take seasonal work in shearing. They will never get that money back; it will be consumed by the system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the other aspects of our position. When I, along with other interested people, set to work to give Australian workers a better deal-not very good news for industrial relations bureaucrats; we did not really think that we were writing some rules for them, as this is-we sat down and decided that the principal requirement for our national economy and the welfare of workers was productivity. It is an undeniable fact that any wage increase granted without an appropriate increase in productivity means more costs to workers. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians consume most of the things that they produce. We are not gigantic exporters in the area of manufacturing or consumption goods. What we produce we consume here. If we are producing the same number of tins of baked beans with a $10 a week wage increase, then baked beans will cost more. But, of course, when the trade unionist goes back to the work force and says, `Boys, I have done a great thing for you this week, I have got your wages put up by $10 a week', he forgets to tell them that his mate Paul Keating is going to take half of that in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the equation? When we get a non-productivity wage increase of, say, $10 the equation is that the employer is up for $15 with the add-ons and the employee is lucky to take home $7 to address that cost flow through. That is pretty helpful for mum on the week that she goes shopping at the supermarket. It is absolutely ridiculous, but of course when it flows through to our national economy it is a tragedy. That is what we are talking about when we talk about enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta talked about the strong and the weak. How strong were the new employees at Power Brewing when they went along and the boss said, `We have got a voluntary employment agreement going here, and you have not got a job yet?'. One would think that was the environment in which to screw them down to the ground, but when the Goss Government came in and threw out that very appropriate measure, what did we discover? We discovered that the employees at Power Brewing were getting $67 a week average more than those covered by the award, for which some trade union official was no doubt taking considerable credit. The boys who negotiated on their own behalf from an absolute position of weakness-they had no job at all-managed to get that much better deal, and they were delighted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting over time to remember the situation at Robe River Iron Associates, how disgraceful that situation had become and how an industry was about to close down. Honourable members read in the paper about the various trade union bureaucrats who whinged, moaned and carried on at that time, but they did not hear about the ones who were ringing me up saying, `For goodness sake, support what Copeman and others are doing'. They were workers at Robe River who just wanted to be honest workers for once and did not want all the rorts that go on. </PARA>
<PARA> Put in the simplest terms, the coalition's policy is the belief that if one has productivity one will get prosperity. It is aimed at more money for workers, not less. It believes that more money can be paid on the basis of productivity and without giving rise to inflation-because the tin of baked beans costs no more if workers are being paid to produce more; neither does the motor car, nor anything else. The time comes when in fact that level of productivity makes us competitive on international markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should remember that, if we want a standard of living anywhere in excess of that of Third World countries, we have got to sell more to the world than we buy. Otherwise, the only way we can maintain any level of prosperity is to do what the Hawke-Keating Government has now done for a time, and that is to borrow money to sustain our prosperity. When the Government boasts about extra jobs, honourable members should remember that the number of new jobs created divided into the debt that we now owe foreign people works out at $60,000-odd a job, which is about four years wages per job. Not one job has been created through productivity; the money has been borrowed in order to buy the jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) shaking his head; that is the truth. The Government has not got any productivity, and without productivity it has not got any progress. Those are the facts of life. The realities are that if this legislation is all that the Government can do to improve the industrial relations system in Australia, then it is not doing very much. The reality is that workers need more money, but unless they produce more the money is worthless to them. It is not a case of what the boss gets out of it; the market will always see one boss after another doing his best to reduce prices and be more competitive because he wants more business. These are the facts that have to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole legislation is no good as it is, and unless our amendments are accepted, then there is no fairness in the system. Everybody knows that the system is one-sided, and most workers are not proud of it. Honourable members should remember that there is many a worker on strike-and there will be some on strike now-who do not want to be there but get bullied into it, and they have no protection from the law. We support what the Government wishes to do but, on the other hand, we call on honourable members to support us on what is a very appropriate and fair measure to balance the legislation and ensure that an employer has exactly the same rights as an employee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; As with previous speakers, my remarks will be confined to the relevance of the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. There are other amendments which impinge on other Acts, but they are not in the ambit of my remarks tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendments to the particular Act to which I have referred go even further towards tipping the balance of power in favour of the union movement. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in his opening remarks on behalf of the coalition, made the point very well, but in order to put these words into some context I mention the fact that the main amendments include provisions which will allow individuals affected by the breach of an award to sue for and recover a penalty for the breach; allow for the recovery from employers of unpaid superannuation contributions; and allow non-unionists to sue for the recovery of unpaid wages due under awards. Those amendments are small enough in themselves, and on the face of it they are quite acceptable to the Opposition, but they are more straws on the camel's back, as it were, in the sense that the transfer of power to the union movement continues virtually unabated. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot recall in the time of the Hawke-Keating Government one provision in industrial relations legislation which conferred an advantage to or an improvement in the circumstances of employers; it has all been one-way traffic. That is the point I want to emphasise. The end result is that what has, it seems forever, been almost a monopoly power in the supply of labour is merely enhanced. We go through all the charade and hear about big business and banks being dumped upon, depending on the circumstances and the diversion that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) wants to create from time to time, but the one great monopoly in this country is that which comes under the umbrella of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). We do nothing to redress that. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as I have already indicated, we go the other way and give the ACTU even greater power to exercise what is a monopoly in that section of the market it is able to control. The honourable member for Bennelong has made the point quite correctly that its influence is diminishing in the private sector and that trade union membership in Australia is at historically low levels-and long may that trend continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong also listed some myths, and he touched on strikes. I would like to develop that part of the myth that we have to contend with in the rhetoric from those opposite from time to time. According to statistics we are fed from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the number of man days lost has decreased over the last decade or so. Whilst the Government takes credit for all that, it certainly is not entitled to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to remind people that the bald figures do not tell the full story-they never have-but even under this Government the method of measurement has changed. Most stoppages and man days lost as a result of those stoppages are simply not measured; they do not appear in the figures. They do not appear because the period of the strike is either too short, because there is no pay lost, or for other reasons. Let me remind the House that that was not always the case. Some of the stoppages which now fall into that category of not measured were previously measured. So we are not comparing like with like in all cases. But that might be just playing at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give the example of what happens in the building industry to this very day. This great trend has developed in the building industry which is called homers. It has nothing to do with baseball or sport. A homer is when they pull a strike for any reason and get the full day off on full pay. That does not even get measured in the figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the House one variation of it. It is on in Perth at the moment and in fact it has happened in Perth over the past four or five years. Someone-we do not know who; one bloke was prosecuted and found guilty, but generally speaking it is impossible to know who-rings up the site and says there is a bomb on the site. The rule is that the blokes go off the site-naturally enough; that would happen in any public building. But they do not just go off the site until the site is cleared, they go home-it is a homer-and they get full pay. The time lost and the tremendous cost that imposes on the building industry is not measured anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> There are go-slow tactics. They are not measured, but the cost to the employer enduring a go-slow campaign is enormous, depending on the nature of the industry or the particular project. There is a refusal to work shifts. Nowhere is that more telling than on the waterfront. The guys simply refuse to go back after a meal break and tie up a ship at a port. We have heard ample testimony as to how much that costs shippers, but more importantly it causes a great deal of loss in terms of markets lost. Of course that is not measurable.</PARA>
<PARA> So no amount of figures can paint the picture of the loss caused by strikes. Indeed, even those figures that are available do not measure the actual loss of time or man days. The statistics certainly do not measure the secondary effects, the flow-on consequences, or the cause of a strike. So to that extent the figures mislead. They allow an escape from reality and they allow this Government to obfuscate on the real state of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I really want to make about strikes is that it is not the quantity of strikes that matters, it is the quality of the strike. The quality of a strike in terms of its cost to this nation can be demonstrated by the case a few years ago where 15 workers in the employ of the Victorian State Electricity Commission went out and were able to close down the whole of industry in Victoria. The only figures measured as a result of that were the man days lost by those 15 men. But they caused untold millions of dollars worth of damage to the whole of industry and they caused employees to be stood down in other industries because they obviously could not work. </PARA>
<PARA> If a handful of aircraft refuellers go out on strike, they cause massive losses. But those losses are secondary; they are not measured. The only thing that might be measured, depending on the duration of the strike, is the number of man days lost by the refuellers themselves. We can also go to the waterfront with the same sort of story. </PARA>
<PARA> It is noteworthy that recently there has been a limited opportunity for employers and employees to get out from under the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The current economic recession in the private sector and the ACTU's determination to pursue mark 6 of the accord in the field presents a rare opportunity to move negotiations over pay and conditions into the workplace where they belong. Employers have been in a good position to call the ACTU's bluff by applying for enterprise agreements under section 115 of the Act in response to this campaign by the ACTU. An application under the Act, though subject to the approval of the Industrial Relations Commission, would nonetheless put the ACTU's enterprise bargaining rhetoric to the test-and it needs to be put to the test. </PARA>
<PARA> So it has been disappointing in the extreme to watch big business in the form of the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures rushing to the Industrial Relations Commission to initiate a new national wage case in an attempt to stave off the ACTU wages campaign. It is difficult to be sympathetic to the plight of big business in this country when it fails to make use of the significant opportunities available to it in the current industrial relations climate. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy, of course, is that the decisions and actions taken by big business simply flow through and impinge upon the business efficacy of those in what is commonly known as small business. Big business in this country obviously prefers the security and comfort of the centralised wages system over the demands of a more flexible enterprise based wages system. It is simply comfortable with it. It does not bode well for our future competitiveness, though. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly surprising then to find business coming under attack from both us and on occasions the Government-in the latter case for different reasons-over its failure to capitalise on this opportunity. Even this Government recognises some, though by no means all, of the limitations that reside in the centralised wages system, or at least it pays lip service to it if it does not realise that. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent person to add his voice to the calls for business to lift its game in this regard is Mr Tony Cole of the Industry Commission in a speech he made yesterday and which is reported in today's Australian. He is reported as saying that the labour market has undergone fundamental changes of a type which allow managers for the first time to actually manage their work forces. May I say as an aside that that independence displayed by Mr Cole in recent times is commendable and the Government would do well to extend a similar degree of latitude to other senior public servants-although he might not fall into the category of a public servant, I am not sure. Perhaps the Government will not be so keen to label him after the Governor of the Reserve Bank's statements earlier this week. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the only area in industrial relations in which business can be found to be dragging its feet. Business has failed, for example, to capitalise on the precedent set during the pilots dispute and to launch common law actions for damages against unions and their members. The most recent case in point was the refuellers dispute. It is noteworthy how different the approach of employers has been to this and other disputes from the approach that was taken in the case of the pilots. In the case of the refuellers they are the same employers. One explanation for this is the fact that the pilots represented a threat to the centralised industrial relations system and so had to be crushed with a device that other unions are rarely even threatened with. In that, the employers had the wholehearted support of this Government-and never let it be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> There is probably no area of policy more in need of fundamental reform than our industrial relations system. Year after year the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in its surveys of the Australian economy pointed to our appalling performance in the area of labour productivity in particular and the devastating fact that almost zero productivity growth has been achieved-if that is the right word, and it is not-in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The rigidities of the labour market permeate every sector of our economy. They impose costs and undermine our competitiveness to a far greater degree than the waterfront, coastal shipping and the many other areas of the economy that have been targeted for reform by both the Government and the Opposition. Hence the Opposition's industrial relations policy, the one which relies on enterprise bargaining, which is the ability of workers and their employers to strike a bargain at the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The enormous gains in productivity that have occurred in enterprises fortunate enough to have been able to establish voluntary enterprise agreements-to stay out of the ambit of the industrial relations club-are indicative of what could happen throughout the entire Australian economy, given freedom of employment. But reform of the centralised wage-fixing system in this country is simply not on the Government's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the limitations of our wages system, but it is not committed to fundamental reform of that system. In fact, everything it does is to enhance and to entrench that system. The Government is committed to an award restructuring process that will result in awards which in a few years time will be as irrelevant to prevailing conditions as today's awards. These awards will be structured along industry lines, not on the basis of enterprise needs, which is the only logical basis for determining pay and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is committed to a union rationalisation process that will again structure union coverage on the basis of industry lines, while ignoring the needs of individual enterprises. The Government talks from time to time about going into enterprise bargaining, but that is not part of the scene; let that be clear to anyone who is interested in this matter. The Government will not touch the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission to award preference to union members, to register and deregister unions, to enforce archaic industrial awards and effectively to outlaw voluntary employment agreements at its whim. The Government remains committed to maintaining the key elements of a system that has demonstrably failed both employers and employees, not to mention the unemployed who are locked out of the labour market by an inability to sell their labour at anything other than award rates. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government remains beholden to the centralised industrial relations system, it is becoming increasingly clear that the trade union movement is fully prepared to use the system opportunistically. The trade union movement enjoys all the benefits of compulsory trade unionism enforced by the Commission, but it is not prepared to tolerate the restraints the system places on its own wage demands. When these demands are not being met by the Government and the Commission, the trade union movement goes into the field to campaign for wage rises. The ACTU ignores the Commission whenever it is convenient for it to do so. It effectively holds the Commission in contempt, although it is the last to be penalised for doing so-that is, if it were ever to be penalised, it would be the last. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong put the position of the Opposition very clearly. As was explained by him, it should be accompanied in the course of time by provisions allowing all employers and employees to withdraw completely from the centralised system and come to their own arrangements as it suits them. That is the ultimate aim and is something the Opposition will strive for, but in the interim, of course, provisions will be put in place for the system to be allowed to work. The honourable member for Bennelong's amendment spells out quite clearly the policy of the Opposition. The amendment reflects the Opposition's policy in its essentials and I offer honourable members opposite the opportunity to think seriously about supporting it. It is interesting to note that our opponents are so concerned about the industrial relations scene in this country that only one speaker could be found to defend the Government's position and its amendments in this debate. </PARA>

For the purposes of sections 187b and 187c, action taken in breach of a direction under section 187a by an officer, employee, member or agent of an organisation shall be deemed to have been taken by the organisation, unless the organisation establishes that it took all reasonable steps to prevent the person from taking the action.'.''. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment seeks to insert on page 4 after clause 12 a new clause 12, which seeks to enshrine-if the Government is agreeable-the provisions of the private member's Bill on compliance that was introduced into the Senate by Senator Chaney as he then was, as the then Opposition spokesman on industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the second reading debate by me and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the purpose of the amendment is to put into the Industrial Relations Act a procedure whereby during the course of an industrial dispute people who believe that they are being damaged by the behaviour of other people in that dispute, who obviously have an interest in the dispute, can go along to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, make their case and ask the Commission to give a direction about how the other people should behave. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Committee-particularly to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) who is at the table and whom I have always regarded as a very reasonable man amenable to logical argument-a proposition. Surely it is reasonable in any industrial dispute-and I accept for the purposes of this debate that all the parties to the dispute respect the role of the Commission as umpire; in other words, I am using the language of the club and the industrial relations true believers in Australia, although I am not one myself, as the chamber well knows-when some members of the club or adherents to club members misbehave for another member of the club to go to the club committee and say, `Look chaps, this is not good enough. Will you tell him or her to behave?'. Surely it is reasonable for that to be done if the person complaining is an employer complaining about irresponsible employee behaviour in breach of an award. Let me refer to the famous Dollar Sweets dispute which was a milestone in the development of industrial relations in this country, and in which my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) played a very distinguished role as counsel for the company. </PARA>
<PARA> On that particular occasion the confectioners' union had thumbed its nose at a request made by a member of the Commission because it regarded requests by the Commission as the playthings-the play dough-of industrial relations. We are endeavouring to put some teeth into the compliance provisions. If this amendment has a fault, I suppose it is that it is giving further strength to the Industrial Relations Commission, and that, in a sense, goes against my grain. But I have to deal with reality. We have an Industrial Relations Commission and I take the view that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If it is good enough, through this Bill, to make sure that an employer who neglects to fulfil his duties under the terms of an award to the detriment of an employee can be exposed to court action-and we will not oppose that-surely it is reasonable that some compliance provisions be put into the Act to protect employers against rogue and predatory behaviour by unions. All we are asking for is a procedure whereby if somebody has a complaint they can march off to the Commission and say, `Will you give a direction?', and if that direction is not complied with or if somebody endeavours to encourage people not to comply with that direction, they can then go to the Federal Court and get an injunction. Once that has occurred it is open to anybody who has suffered from non-observance of that direction to sue for damages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport shakes his head. Members of the Labor Party have been shaking their collective head over this subject for over 80 years-and it is starting to drop off. Their own present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) encouraged the use of common law remedies. Apparently that is all right. But we are asking here for a procedure that can be triggered only if the committee of the club says that it ought to be triggered; one cannot even invoke this procedure unless one gets a direction from the Industrial Relations Commission. Nobody is going to come into this place and tell me that the Industrial Relations Commission is the plaything of the employers; nobody is going to allege that. What we are proposing here is a simple, methodical device with which to inject some element of, not comparative wage justice, but comparative treatment before the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems eminently appropriate to have a piece of legislation designed to make sure that employers toe the line in the area of occupational superannuation. I do not have any quarrel with the proposition that if it is the law of the land that as part of the remuneration package of employees there should be paid superannuation, people should meet that obligation. I do not like that device. I would prefer that occupational superannuation had not become a part of the award approach, but once the Parliament, validated by a decision of the High Court, has determined that that is within the constitutional reach of the Industrial Relations Commission, then I accept that certain consequences flow from that, because I believe in the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the same vein, I put it to the Committee and, most particularly, to my colleague and friend the Minister opposite who, as I have said, is a very reasonable man, that surely if we are prepared to accept that, in the spirit of living by the rule of law, it is not unreasonable for us to ask that the Government accept the proposition that there be a compliance procedure in the Industrial Relations Act which enables an aggrieved party to go to the Commission first-not go to the Court first. This procedure does not get triggered unless a person goes to the Commission and says, `Here is my case; this is what is happening; will you please issue an injunction?'. If this were inserted into the Act, many people would feel that a great deal more had been put into the Act in terms of fair treatment. I particularly commend to the Committee the speech made in the second reading debate of a couple of years ago by former Senator Chaney when he introduced this legislation into the Senate. In that speech he made the same sort of remarks that I am now making. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other final point. It was a point that was made, I think, by the honourable member for Curtin. Time and time again the Government brings legislation into this Parliament which strengthens penalties in relation to recreant employers. Where such legislation is justified, we support it. But in that whole time there has been absolutely no attempt to provide any kind of equal treatment. It is that lack of equal treatment that lends force to those in the community who, quite justifiably, would argue that there is still an imbalance of power in the community between the organised trade union movement and employers. The Government can go a long way towards removing that impression, which it repeatedly says is false, by accepting this eminently reasonable and sensible amendment which will give the semblance of a level playing field in the area of compliance before the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will not be accepting the amendment, although the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), referred to it as being eminently reasonable. I think not. It is not eminently reasonable. It continues to reflect the attitude and the approach which the Opposition has traditionally brought, as I will indicate, to this area of national concern. It is extremely important that Australia maintain an effective arrangement for the settlement of industrial disputes. The Government cannot and will not support this attempt to introduce punitive provisions of the kind that have been suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), in his contribution at the second reading stage, lauded the United States system. I know that this is not sufficient evidence in itself to refute the support that was given for that system, but I suppose one of the essential indicators which would demonstrate the effectiveness of any particular type of industrial relations arrangement which existed would be the effect that it may have, as one of the contributing factors, on labour productivity. I notice that the average increase in labour productivity between 1979 and 1988 in the United States was 0.8 per cent. This situation was endorsed, applauded and lauded by the honourable member for La Trobe. In Australia the figure was 1.1 per cent. It might be claimed that that is not a significant difference, but, of course, a cumulative difference of that kind becomes quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) referred to the fact that there was only one honourable member on the Government side who supported the Government's position. That member was the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who made such an outstanding contribution that, in the light of our knowledge that our colleague's contribution would be so outstanding, we knew that it would not need to be supplemented. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer during the Fraser Government, he showed himself then to be a perceptive person, and he continues to be a perceptive person. I genuinely believe that, to a large extent, one of the reasons why it may have been difficult for the honourable member to achieve his macro agenda, as Treasurer, was the fact that the Fraser Government, generally, adopted an extremely confrontationist approach, as the honourable member knows, to the whole area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not lost that. What it has done with this amendment is simply to attempt to recycle, as the honourable member for Bennelong indicated, the essential elements of the private member's Bill that was introduced into the Senate in 1989 by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) when he was a senator. Our record during the last 7 1/2 years on the level of industrial disputes in Australia reflects not only an awareness on the part of the trade union movement that a Labor government is more responsive and sensitive to an understanding of the problems of industrial relations but also that we have in fact shown a more positive response to them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the suggestion that the honourable member for Bennelong has made in this amendment could not be and will not be supported by us. One of the points that the honourable member for Bennelong made which probably better than anything else summarises the approach of the Opposition was that the amendment is designed to put some teeth into the compliance provisions. That is the approach that those blokes opposite have; they want to put teeth into the compliance provisions. We want to put effective and cooperative procedures into the compliance provisions, and our record indicates that we have done that pretty well. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment unquestionably introduces into that compliance system arrangements and provisions which are heavily and inequitably weighted against the trade union movement and in favour of employers. Some of those inequitable features of the amendment include the fact that there is no appeal against the making of directions; there is no defence to an alleged breach of a direction. It also introduces a system of triple jeopardy whereby, in addition to existing penalties under common law and the Trade Practices Act, a person may sue for damages incurred as a result of a breach of a direction even though no injunction has been issued by the court. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite do not just offend against the normal, reasonable and civilised approaches that we might make to the settlement of industrial disputes; they offend against the normal, traditional and civilised approaches that we have to individual rights and due judicial processes generally. Their lopsided approach to compliance seems better calculated to provoke what has been referred to as destructive, adversarial behaviour than to eliminate it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the inequitable features of the amendment, it suffers from other deficiencies likely to hinder rather than promote good industrial relations. In the first place, it derogates from the role of the Commission by providing a fast track to the Federal Court of Australia. Secondly, the grounds on which an injunction may be issued are vague. The court need only be satisfied that a person has engaged in or is proposing to engage in conduct that constitutes or would constitute: a breach of a direction; an attempt to breach such a direction; aiding, counselling or procuring a person to breach such a direction; inducing or attempting to induce a person to breach such a direction; being in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in, or party to, a breach of such a direction; or conspiring with others to breach such a direction. A person need not necessarily be involved in, but just proposing to engage in, any conduct that constitutes or would constitute such a breach. The availability of direct and immediate access to such a process could well be used to thwart and frustrate efforts by the Commission to resolve an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Paradoxically, the proposed scheme might delay the availability of remedies for industrial action. There is a clear risk that enforcement proceedings in the court could undermine attempts by the Commission to resolve the underlying issues. Given the severity of the remedies and the lack of any sensible process for cooling off, it would be understandable if the Commission and employers treated directions as a process of last resort and were reluctant to use them for fear of inflaming a dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hardly conducive to sensible industrial relations if an interim injunction can be obtained without an examination of the merits of a claim. An application could be made on the strength of the mere apprehension that a union is proposing to attempt to induce a person to breach a direction. It is self-defeating to introduce processes which will completely undermine the commitment of the trade union movement to the conciliation and arbitration process. These proposals are quite contrary to the objective of encouraging commitment to sensible grievance procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has simply forgotten the lesson it had to learn-not at its cost but at great cost to the community-during the 1960s. When the coalition government introduced processes for dispute resolution before access to the enforcement of bans clauses was permitted, it expressly acknowledged that there were two main deficiencies in the existing processes which gave virtual immediate access to penalties: first, the immediacy of availability of enforcement measures and, secondly, the processes did not allow the court to take hold of the dispute between the parties and endeavour to assist them to resolve it. These fundamental weaknesses are reinstated by the proposal from the honourable member for Bennelong. Far from being a prescription for improved industrial behaviour, this proposal represents a return to the discredited confrontationist approach to industrial relations of the Fraser Government. It would make disputes worse and, as has been said by one judge in relation to common law action in industrial disputes, leave a legacy of bitterness towards the parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I said when I started that the honourable member for Bennelong is a perceptive person. I do not put any of the blame for this on him, but to a very large extent I think he has inherited and has been responsible now for promoting those entrenched traditions in relation to industrial disputes which his Party has developed over a long period. We saw what it meant during the period of the Fraser Government. I genuinely believe that that seriously prejudiced the opportunity that he may have had to achieve the sorts of objectives in a macro sense that he was seeking to achieve. In the light of that explanation, I appeal to him to withdraw the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the amendment to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1990 moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). What we are talking about here is balance. A problem that we have today is that, if we remove from the argument all those other areas of industrial relations reform that we on this side of the House would like to see and simply examine the system that we have today which, as has been rightly pointed out, is enshrined in legislation, and if we look at this Bill, we find that the debate is one-sided. We find that there is a critical lack of balance. Time and again there is anecdote after anecdote. The Industrial Relations Commission or State conciliation and arbitration commissions or industrial relations boards make orders which tell unions and union members, who have taken strike action despite repeated warnings that such action was inappropriate, that they will not hear the case that they have been hearing until the unions discontinue the action and go back to work. Time and again the unions ignore the recommendations of the Commission and continue the action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comments I made earlier in the debate are appropriate when we talk about toothlessness. The Commission is truly toothless when it comes to enforcing one side of the debate. It is very good at enforcing the rights of unions and the rights of employees. That is positive; I have no argument with that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Commission is very bad at enforcing the rights of employers. It seems to me that in a democratic society, we really should try to talk about balance: equal rights and equal responsibilities-`responsibilities' being a pretty important word. If the unions are unwilling to accept their responsibilities, there is no recourse for management; none whatsoever. The amendment to this legislation, proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong, is eminently sensible and provides true balance to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, has said that the arguments from this side and the proposed amendment are not eminently reasonable. Of course they are reasonable. They are reasonable because if one examines a piece of legislation in any court, under our system the court requires that there be some balance. But we have none with the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and it is long past time that we did. I would like to point out to the Minister at the table that the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, commenting on the Industrial Relations Bill 1987-which never made it-said:</PARA>
<PARA>The essential element of any industrial relations system which provides benefits and protections to registered organisations and their members is that there should be an effective means of ensuring adherence to the principles on which the system is founded and compliance with the decisions of its institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>Bloody sensible, excellent statement-balance, adherence. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Minister comes before us, stands at the dispatch box and says, `This amendment is not eminently reasonable because it will give balance to the existing legislation; it will allow compliance with decisions by the Industrial Relations Commission'-compliance, Minister. That is what we are talking about. We are offering to give employers the same rights that we give the unions. My goodness, is that not a terrible concept? We cannot come to grips with that, can we-not when we have an accord between the bureaucracy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and this Government? Of course we cannot have that, because Bill Kelty will not let the Government have it-and that is a fact. The Minister can write it down, put it in headlines and put it on the front page of the paper tomorrow, because it is true: Bill Kelty will not let the Government do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that the honourable member for Bennelong is right. It knows that this is a sensible amendment to the Bill which we support. The Minister knows in his heart that it is the right thing to do, but Kelty will not let him do it. Is that not a shame? Goodness gracious me. We have this big, powerful, long-serving Hawke Labor Government controlled by a bureaucracy of unions called the Australian Council of Trade Unions-shame, Mr Minister, shame. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also spoke about this amendment `hindering good industrial relations'. It will hinder good industrial relations because an employer might be allowed to stand up on his hind legs and say, `Look, it is not reasonable for the workers at Esso to remove their labour from the work force; it is not reasonable that we close down the bankrupt State of Victoria because we can't get petrol to drive the vehicles; it is not reasonable when the Industrial Relations Commission has said, ``Come in and talk and we'll sort this thing out''.' `Come in and talk'-that is what the Commission said. `Stop your action and talk'-that sure sounds terribly unreasonable to me! It is a proper course of action. The Commission under the system that we have today has done the right thing, but have the workers gone back? No, sir, they have not-and the bankrupt State of Victoria is going to become banana land. If we continue with this current approach, there will be nothing left for this country, nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA> So I would argue with the Minister that this amendment will not hinder good industrial relations: it will assist it. If we continue with the current centralised system-and I am assured by the Minister that we will-then, for heaven's sake, give the system some balance. Without that balance, it does not work. It is all one-sided; it is undemocratic. It is wrong in principle, it is wrong in practice, and it is wrong in fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also said that we need a predictive system. That is good. I agree with that. It is good that industry can predict where industry is going and how it will operate. It would be terrific if the people could predict what would happen in this land of industrial relations. If they could, they would know when they were not going to be able to get a tram to work; when they were not going to be able to get their goods off the wharf; when steel would not become available out of the mills; when they could not get petrol to drive their cars; when bread and milk were not going to be available in the shops. I commend this amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Committee much longer, but I am forced just to correct three things which came from the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). The first thing I must correct is the impression the Minister created that this was establishing a fast track to the Federal Court. I just point out to him that the starting point is an approach to the Industrial Relations Commission. I make the further point that for material purposes the amendment reads, `the Commission may give'. In other words, it is entirely in the discretion of the Commission, and there is no way on earth that a Commission clothed with this power and authority-if this amendment were to become law-would be in a situation where somebody went along to it with a capricious, irresponsible complaint about union conduct. That is just not the plain meaning of the words. The words are not mandatory, they are discretionary. One is dealing in the first instance with the Commission, one is not dealing with a court. So all of the concerns that he expressed about the new and dangerous extension of power are simply not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point relates to the attitude of the Opposition to unions. If our attitude on this Bill were an exercise in union bashing, an exercise in some kind of historical hostility to the workers of this country, we would have voted against the Bill-but we did not. We let it go through on the second reading because we accept that if a worker gets chiselled there ought to be some recompense. So that completely explodes his idea that we are totally motivated here by some sort of primeval hatred of unions and all that they stand for. I make the point again-and I will do so in every speech that I make on industrial relations in this place or elsewhere-that I have no quarrel with the mainstream of trade unionism in this country. It is part of the fabric of our life. </PARA>
<PARA> My argument is with monopoly power, wherever it is found. It is found in the hands of government, in the hands of industrialists and in the hands of trade union bureaucrats. I put free bargaining above institutions in industrial relations. That disposes of the philosophical hang-up that still resides in the mind of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Much and all as I appreciate the remarks that the Minister directed to the historical perspective of Australian politics I remind him that I was the author of section 45d of the Trade Practices Act which arguably has been the most potent weapon in protecting business, particularly small business, against predatory union conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also remind the Minister that some of the remarks of foreboding he made about this very humble and reasonable amendment pale into insignificance compared with the remarks that his current leader, the then President of the ACTU, directed to me across a negotiating table when I talked to the ACTU and the other peak councils of the union movement in 1976 and 1977 about section 45d of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth reminding the House that when I proposed that amendment in 1976 and 1977 it was not only opposed by the trade union movement but also criticised by a significant number of employer groups who thought it was going too far. There were all sorts of predictions then about blood flowing in the streets and ripping asunder the fabric of industrial life in this country. Most objective people would now acknowledge that section 45d has brought a degree of balance and sanity into the conduct of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with some sadness that the expectation of the normal capacity I have in this House to appeal to the Minister's sense of justice and reasonableness has not been matched on this occasion. I am sorry about that. Using the Minister's own refrain, I know that it is not his fault. I know that he would like to agree and support it, if it were not for the constraints of the party system under which he operates. I thank the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Tonight I would like to raise a subject of rather more enduring substance than the mechanisms for wage-tax trade-offs and endless economic jargon. Since 1918 dozens of governments and Prime Ministers have come and gone but the works of artist and writer May Gibbs have never been out of print.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May Gibbs was one of the most original and creative talents our nation has known. For over half a century she produced books, images and humour which have had a profound effect on our national identity. In the words of South Australian writer Christabel Mattingly, `She is without dispute the most important figure in the development of a genuine Australian literature for children'. </PARA>
<PARA> May Gibbs was Australia's first woman cartoonist and the `Bib &amp;Bub' strip together with such works as Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie have encouraged generations of children not only to read but to appreciate our unique environment. She was one of our first environmentalists and conservationists. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years a grass roots movement has been growing throughout Australia to preserve Nutcote, May Gibbs's home for 45 years, to provide a museum of her works both as an educational and tourist centre. Many members of this House and the Government have received letters and petitions from individuals and groups from all States asking for support. So far they have received a deafening silence. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a project to win elections or to inflate political or bureaucratic egos. It does not have the importance of a $900,000 dining room or the hundreds of cultural centres throughout Australia that owe their existence to vote-buying. It is a project to honour a remarkable woman whose genius and generosity have done so much for every generation of Australians for over 70 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a project to preserve an important part of Australia's cultural heritage and a building listed by the National Trust, the New South Wales Heritage Council and the Register of the National Estate. It is on a magnificent waterfront site on Sydney Harbour. It is a project to provide a cultural centre for the school children of Australia and a centre of outstanding appeal to visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australia is reeling in future shock at the massive sell-off of public assets and increasing foreign ownership, surely as a community we can save something of irreplaceable value to our heritage, identity and culture. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1986 ordinary citizens have worked through an organisation called the May Gibbs Foundation for this project. Thousands of school children, citizens and organisations have held fundraising functions for Nutcote. With the help of North Sydney Council, the Foundation has already raised over $750,000, but it is a long way short of the necessary $3.5m to bring the project to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 North Sydney Council gave the project a tremendous impetus by proposing the purchase of the site with funding on a dollar for dollar basis by local, State and Federal government. In spite of the commitment to the project by now senior State Government Ministers Collins and Moore prior to the 1988 State election, the Greiner Government has virtually ignored all requests for help, as has this Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In a desperate attempt to prevent Nutcote from becoming yet another block of super luxury home units on Sydney Harbour, North Sydney Council has now purchased the site for $2.86m. The Council has done this as a holding operation in the hope that the balance of the funds for the project can be found before its deadline of September 1991. This is a national project and one small local government body should not, and cannot, finance it. If the funds are not obtained by the deadline the property must be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> A trust and national fundraising committee are now being set up and the Government is being asked for $1 for every $2 raised by the trust. This is a small contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Other countries take pride in preserving the birthplaces and homes of their major creative artists as a focus of national and international interest. When both State and Federal governments have realised billions of dollars from asset sales, when, even in the North Sydney electorate, asset sales well in excess of $150m have been made or proposed, when funds are available for a stream of overseas junkets and thousands of esoteric capital projects, it is incomprehensible to many thousands of Australians that both State and Federal governments scorn our cultural heritage by refusing to support this project. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to inform honourable members of a real old-fashioned rags to riches success story. It is especially satisfying to me to bring to the attention of the House a success story that comes from my electorate of Fowler which, being located in the south-western suburbs of Sydney, has been over the years very unfairly labelled as something of a wasteland of high unemployment and low opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The truth, as I will continue to tell this House, is diametrically the opposite, with Sydney's west being a rapid growth area of opportunity, vibrancy and unlimited promise. The fact is that the organisation I intend to speak about tonight, the Mount Pritchard and District Community Club Ltd, is a living example of just how much potential there is in the area and how that potential can be efficiently tapped with the right combination of resolve, leadership and product. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows that some clubs are finding the going tough at the moment, with disposable income at a premium and interest rates biting into the reserves of organisations that overcommitted themselves in the good times. For the record, the Mount Pritchard and District Community Club, which is known as the Mounties, is in the process of completing a major $6m extension without owing a single cent to anybody. This is in addition to several past major extensions, which included a multimillion dollar program in the mid-1980s which added a new mixed lounge and an indoor sports area. These extensions were opened by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on 9 June 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 the Mounties Club has in excess of 300 employees, and under the guidance of entertainment director Harry Norton it spends more than $1m annually on entertainment. It is a powerhouse organisation which caters to the interests of the south-western Sydney population by its style of operation, its generous support of community organisations, and its emphasis on encouraging sporting and recreation endeavours for all ages. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes the Mounties' current lofty position so satisfying for me is the knowledge of how the organisation began its existence in the early 1960s. At that time there was no grandiose building and no glowing bank book-just the presence of two old government huts which were transported onto the present site from the Herne Bay migrant hostel in 1961, following the gifting of the land from the late Tom McAuliff in exchange for some debentures in the new club. Those two huts cost #300. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the Mounties Club was born out of the inspiration of a few drinkers in a Cabramatta pub. They were men who were concerned at the lack of facilities for the wives and children of the many people who had moved to the west from the city on the then Government's promise of homes for those who could come up with #100. Despite the poor circumstances of many of the families coming to the area at the time, hundreds of people parted with their money to purchase debentures, which allowed the club to commence operations. It was the type of sacrifice that typified the community attitude of Sydney's south-west and western suburbs, which has prevailed to carry the club and south-western Sydney to their current positions of strength and optimism. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it would be wrong to name individuals amongst a host of people who have contributed much to the Mounties Club, no one in Fowler would begrudge a special mention being given to Mr Mick Dubois. In many respects Mick Dubois could be described as Mr Mount Pritchard. He was appointed secretary in 1968, a post he held until 1987, when he became general manager. He retired in 1988, having played an integral role in both the expansion of the club and the organisation of its style of conducting business. </PARA>
<PARA> The Mounties Club has been successful in Fowler because it is recognised locally as a friendly organisation which represents the aspirations of the community. But it has also been run by a board of directors which contains members who have been with the club since its foundation. I suspect that the steady composition of the board, and the obvious commitment of those who serve in that post, have had as much to do with the outstanding success of the club as any other factors. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the cause of its success, the Mounties Club, its board of directors, its general manager, Vic Smith, its president, Ray Pugsley, and of course its members, deserve the congratulations of this House on the club's continuing record of achievement. I am sure that all honourable members will join with me in wishing the club the success it deserves with its new, expanded premises. </PARA>

<TITLE>Australian Defence Industries: Apprentices</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3113" SPEAKER="Reid The Hon N.B." NAMEID="VT4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENDIGO">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bendigo)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.44)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an issue for the attention of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) with respect to the 1991 intake of apprentices into Australian Defence Industries (ADI) Bendigo facility. I have been advised that the intake for 1991 will include only 10 apprentices in the trades: including three boilermakers, two fitters and machinists and one electrician. I understand that the normal intake is 25 apprentices and that the reason it has taken in 25 in previous years is that every year it has little regard for the manpower requirements at the ADI institution. The intake in fact exceeded the natural attrition rate and projected growth of the workload. The reason it took this benevolent approach was to supplement the skills requirement of the general region of Bendigo. Apprentices who did not find employment elsewhere upon completion of their apprenticeship were usually retained by that facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not pleading for benevolence or charity in this particular request. What I am saying is that the apprenticeship scheme is much more important and cost effective than many of the Government's current schemes for employment. Many of the Government's training schemes have not worked out satisfactorily. They have used an extensive amount of capital and funding requirements and have not really retained the people in the work force or trained people effectively for the work force. The trades I have mentioned are portable and they are in demand in both the public and private sectors. There are opportunities for apprentices to be trained in all of those trades at Australian Defence Industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to its normal intake, an extra 10 to 15 apprentices were engaged for a period of 12 months on behalf of other businesses under the Commonwealth rebate for apprentice full time training (CRAFT) scheme. The CRAFT scheme led to many people having the opportunity to be trained in an apprenticeship craft and they then went out into the private sector or the public sector and found employment. The scheme of apprenticeship training proved to be very satisfactory to the needs of young people, particularly in the Bendigo area. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons, of course, has been the fact that Australian Defence Industries has now taken on a role where it is not entirely dependent upon the Government for its funding. It is moving towards maintaining a level of activity in the private sector where it can compete with private enterprise, and it does compete on equal grounds. The factory is trying to work itself into a situation where it will not be dependent upon funds from the Government and will compete on equal terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to look at the situation and see whether the Government has a commitment to apprenticeship training in that region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to bring to the attention of this House a unique cultural event that has occurred recently in my electorate. In fact, it was a series of events, functions and activities over a period of a month, all under the banner of Youth Arts 90. The purpose of this very successful festival was to encourage young people's access to and involvement in the arts, to highlight what young people have to offer us all, and to promote youth arts as a viable employment industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My electorate contains a lot of culturally diverse people. The vibrant atmosphere and youthful contribution must be seen and/or heard to be appreciated. The public were treated to a delightful and talented display of music, drama and dance and good old-fashioned entertainment, presented with all the originality and unabashed enthusiasm that the creativity of youth, when encouraged and nurtured, brings forth. Also forming a part of Youth Arts 90 was the visit of Death Defying Theatre. This was part of the Australia Council's access and touring program. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just a small part of the Hawke Government's cultural policy of enabling Australians to enjoy and participate in the arts. Another contribution of the Government to Youth Arts 90 was that, through the community cultural and development unit of the Australia Council, the festival was documented by photography, writing and visual means. This will ensure a lasting reminder of Youth Arts 90. In fact, this record will form a touring exhibition to the rest of Australia illustrating what youth-the next generation-can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay tribute to those people and organisations that made this festival such a success. I congratulate Norart, Northern Rivers Regional Arts Association, for initiating the festival and the President, Ros Derrett, who coordinated the regional theatre skills workshop and the tour by Death Defying Theatre, one highlight of the festival. I also congratulate Lismore City Council for its encouragement and support of Youth Arts 90. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for the arts from local governments plays a vital part in ensuring the development of a vibrant cultural life in the Australian community. The arts have an important role to play in fostering employment opportunities, and I point out again that one of the goals of the festival was to promote youth arts as a viable employment industry. The arts create significant benefits through tourism opportunities and I am sure that festivals of this kind can be a valuable tourist drawcard in many electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates of the value of arts industries in this region are in the order of $30m-an astonishing figure. If people visit the north coast region and see the spectrum of bands that ply their trade in hotels and clubs, for instance, they will know what I mean-from heavy metal bands like Bloody Mary to the Dynamic Lifters, a local a cappella group which functions quite well. I also pay tribute to the school of music at the University of New England Northern Rivers campus. This very progressive unit is leading Australia in training people for the entertainment industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a little shocked by the matter of public importance put forward by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) today, condemning the Government on its policies and the effect they have on teaching and research in higher education. New buildings and constructions erected as a result of capital money being made available by the Federal Government have to be seen in this university. The facility itself has been much applauded by those in the industry who understand what it will mean to training, education and research in the music industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure we all pay tribute to the vision and concerted efforts of all concerned who saw the potential benefits of Youth Arts 90. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to Panos Couros, coordinator of the gala day, who was assisted by the Youth Arts team-Andrew Ewing, Shona Gelin, Maxine Whelan, Gay Rutley and Shaun Peter, and to Helen O'Moore and Vanessa Chalker who worked tirelessly to coordinate and publicise the month's activities. Finally, I compliment the young people themselves on their involvement. Their work is ongoing and will continue to contribute to the vitality of arts in my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the matters of social justice and compassion, as raised today by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The Treasurer asked the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) what he knew of ordinary Australians. I ask the Treasurer what he knows of ordinary Australians. I presume he knows that they do not have two homes and do not wear Italian suits, enjoy antique clocks or travel in VIP planes to the football. But he does not seem to know that many young Australian families with children cannot afford to go to the football.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under this Government families have suffered. The pleasures that were taken for granted eight years ago are no longer possible. Figures from the social policy research centre of the University of New South Wales show that couples with children, on average incomes or below, experienced a drop of 4 per cent in real disposable income between 1982-83 and 1989-90. Is this the compassion the Treasurer was talking about, the concern for social justice?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed dismally in the economic field. In a desperate attempt to find a platform for the next election, the Government has settled for the rhetoric of social justice. Rhetoric is all that it is. The Treasurer talks of compassion. What about compassion for rural families, families struggling under a rural crisis with incomes of less than half the average weekly wage? These families are excluded from the Treasurer's compassion, just as they are now excluded from the family allowance and their children are excluded from Austudy. Is that the compassion of this Labor Government? Is it that the compassion of this Labor Government does not extend to men, women and children who do not live in Labor electorates?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government likes to suggest it has a special hold on social justice. The facts do not bear that out. Despite the posturing of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on child poverty, the proportion of children living in poverty has increased from 14.4 per cent in 1982-83 to 14.8 per cent in 1989-90. Today between 450,000 and 500,000 children are living in poverty. Some 1.85 million Australians are living in relative poverty as defined by the Henderson poverty line, and 1.1 million are in absolute poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a report this year from the Victorian Council of Social Service, Government policies were forcing thousands of Australians to beg to survive. The same source informs us that the number of people seeking emergency food at welfare centres has risen 40 per cent this year. These are not just figures put out by social policy units. In my own electorate the three major churches which look after the poor, those who do not have enough to live, have come to me and said that they can no longer afford to give enough out to people who come to them to get food for their children because they do not have enough to get through the day. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable to those on this side of the House that Australians should live in poverty and that there are two types of Australians: those who live in or near the poverty line on government handouts and the rest of us. Those who are forced to live on government handouts have a miserable existence. Whether we like it or not, it is through work that we obtain our identity and it is through work that we obtain much of our social contact and personal satisfaction. Those who are forced to live on government handouts for more than a short period become trapped in a culture of poverty. Everyone and everything suffers: self-esteem, lifestyle, education and independence. What is worse, the culture of poverty is transferred to the children, whose options for the future are limited by their childhood environment. The way to get people out of poverty is to provide an economic climate in which businesses prosper and where men and women can obtain work and do not have to go to the Government, cap in hand, asking for a minimum income, or to the churches begging for money to survive. </PARA>

<TITLE>Construction of Power Line in Northern Rivers Area</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3115" SPEAKER="Woods Mr H.F." NAMEID="0U4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="PAGE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0U4">Mr HARRY WOODS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Page)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.56)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is increasing concern on the north coast of New South Wales over the construction of a 330-kilovolt power line between Grafton and Coffs Harbour, with concern over public health through exposure to electromagnetic radiation, concern over destruction of rare flora and fauna species, concern that alternative power sources have not been adequately explored, concern that residents living near the proposed line have not been adequately consulted, and concern that the results of a commission of inquiry into the line have been precluded because the Electricity Commission of New South Wales (Elcom) continues to work on the line whilst the inquiry is under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is concern that Elcom employees have entered privately and illegally, and against the wishes of landowners, to carry out survey work. Elcom argues that the new high-voltage power line is needed to satisfy the electricity demands of the northern rivers into the future. That may well be so, but the way in which it has gone about the work leaves a lot to be desired. It all started with a environmental impact statement on the route which was widely reported to be seriously flawed. There were claims that several species of threatened flora and fauna were directly threatened by the route. Undaunted, Elcom pressed on. It now says it will undertake a scientific study after the line is completed. The damage, if there is to be any, will have already been done by then. Are the scientists going to count the number of dead birds that could have been saved if the route had been altered in the first place? Will they alter the route of the line if they find it was not correct? I think not. The former Chief Justice of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, is currently conducting an inquiry into the line under the electricity Act but the work goes on. Scores of trees continue to be cleared and towers continue to be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> Elcom also has written to the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service asking permission to destroy Aboriginal relics along the route of the line. It is worrying to the Aboriginal community and to local residents. The environmental impact statement is currently being challenged in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. Aerial inspections of the route reveal that significant portions of the proposed route have not been started. The land owners have refused to give permission for work to start but that has not stopped work proceeding on other areas. What will happen if those landowners never give permission? Will the areas already cleared be left and another route explored? Will that environmental damage have been caused for no result?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the results of the commission of inquiry will be or what the result of the Land and Environment Court hearing into the environmental impact statement will be, but I find it extremely questionable that significant environmental damage continues to occur while court hearings and commissions are under way. Surely if work is continuing while these processes are under way we are precluding their findings. It is of great importance that in all dealings of this nature the results in terms of damage to the environment and benefit to the population are known before work starts. Otherwise we are doing ourselves and our environment great harm, and for possibly no result. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this there has been little emphasis on energy conservation. Events overseas in recent weeks have shaken us into an immediate realisation of the fragility of current energy supply systems. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) The ABC has advised that Radio News did not give precedence to the results of the men's semi-finals over the women's final when covering the US Open Tennis on 9 September.

The national news bulletins at 0630, 0700, 0715 and 0745 featured the result of the women's final, followed by a reference to the men's semi-final coming up. By 0900, the men's semi-final was under-way and therefore the fact that McEnroe was fighting to survive came first, followed by the women's results-already covered earlier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Norway</PARA>
<PARA>Sweden</PARA>
<PARA>Switzerland</PARA>
<PARA>United Kingdom</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The International Tin Council operated from 1956 under a series of International Tin Agreements, the last of which was the Sixth Agreement which was operative from 1982 until the ITC was formally dissolved on 31 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) From its inception to the time of its collapse in October 1985 the ITC operated a Buffer Stock with the aim of maintaining stable tin prices. Funds for the Buffer Stock operation came from member contributions and borrowings. Due to overproduction by non ITC members and currency fluctuations, the cost of maintaining the buffer stock was extremely high and by late 1985 the Buffer Stock Manager was financially unable to continue with his operations. The ensuing collapse in the tin price decreased the value of the Buffer Stock to such an extent that the ITC was unable to meet its obligations to a number of bank and broker creditors.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Within six months of the collapse of the ITC's, buffer stock operations, world tin prices had fallen by around 50%. This brought about a major rationalisation of Australia's tin industry, which at the time of the collapse comprised in excess of 120, mostly small scale, producers concentrated in North Queensland. The effect was to cause the closure of almost all small scale mines and to concentrate tin production in the hands of one large producer, Renison Goldfields Consolidated. The impact on Australia's total tin output, however, was not large, as Renison, then free of ITC production quota restrictions, expanded its production.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations did not leave the Australian Government with any formal obligations. A series of court cases mounted by the ITC's creditors determined that the ITC's members had no legal obligations for the ITC's debts. Australia, however, joined with all other ITC members in agreeing to an out of court settlement with the ITC's creditors. Australia contributed an amount of 7.34 million pounds sterling ($A15.6m) towards the settlement of 182.5 million pounds sterling.</PARA>
