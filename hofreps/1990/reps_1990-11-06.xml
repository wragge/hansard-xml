<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Prime Minister of his statement reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 27 June 1987, `I am very, very confident that Australia has gone through the worst, that the crisis has bottomed and that we are not going to have the repetition of that loss of national income.' I also refer the Prime Minister to his statement on the AM program this morning that `Our view is that we are approaching the bottom of the turndown'. I ask the Prime Minister: when does he expect us to reach the bottom? What confidence in his statements can the Australian people have, given that he has so consistently failed to deliver in the past?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable gentleman that the date he referred to was the middle of June 1987 which, of course, preceded the world stock market crash in October of 1987 and the turnaround in the terms of trade, which imposed very considerable pressures upon this country and which called upon us, responsibly, to undertake, as we did, a significant slowing down as we reached the position last year, as the honourable gentleman knows, of an unacceptable situation where we had an 8 per cent increase in gross national expenditure and a 4 per cent increase in production. He knows, at least as a former professor of economics, if not as a politician, that a continuation of that situation was unsustainable and that the interests of this country demanded in those circumstances that we add to an already tight fiscal policy and tight wages policy a tightening of monetary policy. This we did. In those circumstances we have witnessed a slowing down of activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Responsibly in this year we have on five occasions eased off monetary policy as we thought it appropriate to do and there is now a number of indicators that we are approaching the bottoming of that turndown in activity. Let me make this point in answer to the honourable gentleman: there has been some talk about whether I and the Treasurer concede that there is a recession. What the Treasurer and I have said on that issue is simply this, and I repeat it here in the House: as the Leader of the Opposition well knows-I think he does not argue about the proposition-in technical economic terms a recession is said to have occurred when there have been two measured successive quarters of negative economic growth. I simply say that if that occurs-and the signs are that it could--</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Oh!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no `Ohs' or `Ahs' about that. I am not saying anything new in that respect. I am simply saying that if that occurs then according to the professional, technical measurement of members of the economics profession they will say that in technical terms a recession has been measured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But we have said that we recognise that, as a result of the deliberate policies we have brought into play, necessarily there has been a slowing down of activity. We have not denied that there has been that turning down. We have simply referred to the fact that, when we talk about the question of, technically, a recession, we require two successive measured quarters of negative economic growth. But the point is-as I think the Leader of the Opposition well knows-that if the Government had not taken the decisions that it has in the area of monetary policy to slow down the economy in this country, then the rest of the world would have imposed a far more drastic solution upon us. Neither I nor the Treasurer, nor the Government, derive any pleasure whatsoever from the fact that we have had to slow the economy down. But we know that if we had not done it and if we had not responsibly taken those decisions, then the economy would have been in much worse shape.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also said before-and I repeat it briefly, in coming to a conclusion to my answer to the honourable gentleman's question-that all of the evidence is there that the slowdown that has occurred has not achieved the dimensions of the recession of 1982-83 with which the honourable gentleman was then associated. I remind him of the fundamental economic statistics that are relevant to that. He has had it neither in the area of the measurement of employment turndown, nor has he had it in terms of what has happened to wages growth. We then had a 17 per cent wages explosion. We have nothing like that, and because of those fundamental decisions we have taken which are now being reflected in the economy we believe that we are coming towards the bottoming of this activity, and we believe that as we go into the second half of this financial year we will see a turn-up in economic activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will he inform the House of the prospects for more efficient and harmonious relations between the Commonwealth Government and the States following the recent Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3278" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I believe that there are now very real grounds for optimism about a marked and sustained improvement in the conduct of Federal-State relations. I say that for three basic reasons. First, the Brisbane conference clearly confirmed that there is now a widespread recognition of the need to make our federal system work better and there is, allied with that, a determination to bring that about. That attitude covered and governed the way in which all State Premiers, Chief Ministers, representatives of local government and the Deputy Prime Minister and myself approached the discussions in Brisbane. Anyone who was there would agree that the rigid attitudes and jealousies of the past were on this occasion replaced by commonsense, flexibility and a determination to get on with the job in hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the important and concrete decisions taken in Brisbane provide very tangible evidence indeed of this underlying change in attitude to which I refer. In particular, I draw attention to these specific concrete decisions: firstly, new arrangements for the more efficient and cooperative conduct of the annual Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings; secondly, agreement to establish a national food authority; and, thirdly, agreement to establish a single commercial corporation to undertake interstate rail freight services, to set up a national heavy vehicle registration scheme, and on means of improving the performance of government trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, it is important to understand that the Brisbane conference was not a one-off event, but set in train an agreed process of reform. This is, in other words, not some vague and open-ended review. On financial relations, duplication of services, harmonisation of regulations and other matters, the work initiated by the Brisbane conference is very carefully targeted. It will take place within clearly established principles and terms of reference and, importantly, it is subject to specific deadlines.</PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic and, indeed, sad for the country that at a time when the Commonwealth and the State and local governments have come together so constructively, the Opposition's only forays on federalism have been so childish and so negative. The Opposition would do better to take its steer from the Premiers, including the New South Wales Premier.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, in a press release of 17 October in which the Opposition thought it smart to leak certain Premiers Conference documents, we had a declaration from the honourable member for Mitchell that a great opportunity was about to be wasted. That pernicious prejudgment by the Opposition has been shown to be totally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then we had the Opposition's extraordinary statement about social security with its absurd implication that the Commonwealth should move out of the area of income support, an area in which, of course, equity demands uniformity across the country and a strong Federal role.</PARA>
<PARA> If any further confirmation were needed of the fantasy land thoughts of the Leader of the Opposition on federalism, it came with his proposal of 1 November to replace the Commonwealth Budget with a Federal budget. On 2 November the media reported Opposition sources as saying that such an approach would involve an extended process of scrutiny and negotiation over the details of State Budgets along the lines of the Commonwealth Government's Expenditure Review Committee (ERC).</PARA>
<PARA> It is absolutely alarming that the Leader of the Opposition knows so little of the workings of Federal-State relations, the ERC and the Budget process that he thinks such a scheme as that is either desirable or practical. The tossing up of ideas such as this is a further indication that both the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition itself have nothing to add in a constructive way to this important issue of Federal-State relations. It stands in stark contrast to the very constructive attitude of all the Premiers--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Scullin for his question. I am able to report to the House that we have achieved very positive results from the Special Premiers Conference in the areas of housing, health, aged care, home and community care, disability services, child-care and the supported accommodation assistance program. The States, Territories and the Commonwealth have agreed to a series of functional reviews in these areas. They are designed to look at what are the appropriate roles for the Commonwealth and the States in planning, delivering and monitoring the outcomes of specific programs and are based on the following considerations: the extent of any national interest and the scope and level of national objectives; the scope for diversity of approach between States, including room for flexibility in delivery of services; achieving administrative arrangements that are simple and as cost-effective as possible; the best methods for coordinating related programs, including at the local level, and providing the correct incentives for cost-effective service delivery; the need for clear and effective accountability to the electorate and the client group; and, finally, achieving effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms at the least possible administrative cost to the Government and service providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recognise that problems exist because of overlap of activity at different levels of government. But that is merely a symptom of a deeper set of problems of defining rationally and in a coordinated way the respective roles of the Commonwealth, State and local governments. The roles for the tiers of government must be designed on the basis of sound policy, not to avoid cost shifting between different levels of government. Through the process of functional reviews we are determined to achieve that clear and agreed definition of roles.</PARA>
<PARA> I take one particular example of an approach and contrast for a moment the difference of approach between the Government and the Opposition. In June of this year social welfare Ministers in the Commonwealth and the States looked at the area of disability. They agreed to set up a working party. At the Conference last week the Premiers were able to agree in terms of a division of responsibility with respect to disability as between labour market related programs that were delivered by the Commonwealth and programs that went to accommodation that were delivered by the States. That agreement on a rational basis in an important area of policy was a result of taking policy seriously, as opposed to the Leader of the Opposition who, in referring to this area of social security, suggested that it could effectively be demolished as a Commonwealth function and the function devolved not simply to the States but to the non-government sector; the non-government sector would be asked to bear responsibility for the delivery of income security payments in this country. The Leader of the Opposition turns away and chats to other people. Effectively, having big-noted himself to a number of members of the Gallery--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Sunday night I appeared on a program in which I was interviewed by someone responsible for one of the largest non-government agencies in Sydney. He asked me what I thought of the proposal and I indicated that I was not altogether impressed. He then contributed-without my suggesting it-the notion that the Leader of the Opposition, who now cannot listen to an answer to a question, was naive and had no understanding of the welfare system. In fact, he said that the Leader of the Opposition's office rang around a number of agencies in Sydney to try to find one non-government agency that supported what was put forward and, after some time, managed to find one small agency that went along with the Opposition's proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We as a parliament have to decide whether we will determine national policy on rational grounds and whether we will take the States and the non-government sector seriously. The Leader of the Opposition, as soon as he moved off his own turf, put up an irresponsible program that you, Fred, would never have bought in a fit because it was a mad proposal walked away from by the Leader of the Opposition and certainly by his spokesperson after it became clear that that proposition would not be worn.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to comments by Mr Brian Loton, Managing Director of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, on 26 October when, with respect to Government economic policy, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . we have policies running at cross-purposes; on the one hand, a monetary policy to restrain inflation and demand, and on the other, a wages policy which could well be having the opposite effect.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless we make some fundamental changes, we face the prospect of being a country in fundamental decline.</PARA>
<PARA>Is Mr Loton correct? If so, when will the Treasurer announce plans for a mini-Budget, an economic U-turn, to signal a change of direction?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3281" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Loton was making a point which the Business Council of Australia often makes, that is, that it believes there should be a more flexible labour market than the one we now have. He was making the point that the accord processes, in his terms, underpin wages growth at around 6 to 7 per cent and hence, in terms of his argument, put the floor under inflation. On the very weekend Mr Loton was saying that, the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA) said that it would reject any option of wage flexibility and that the wage flexibility that the Government is offering by way of an enterprise bargaining tier would, in its terms, only lead to leapfrogging; it said that it wanted a national wage case decision around a set amount for the enterprise bargaining tier at the forthcoming national wage discussion. In other words, while the Business Council was arguing for a less rigid, more flexible approach, the largest metal trades employing organisation in the country, the MTIA, was arguing for the very opposite-as was the Confederation of Australian Industry (CAI).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing one can say to the employers of this country is that they ought to get their argument straight. Do they want a more flexible labour market of the kind the Government is trying to introduce, and which is best introduced at a time of slower economic activity, or do they want to stick with the more rigid wage system which has been effective in reducing aggregate wage movements but which could be more effective in being able to target labour at the place of the economy which is prepared to pay more for it and which, in that sense, needs it more? That is the difference. It is one thing for Mr Loton to put that view; it is another thing for other major employer groups to take any notice of it.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Government is concerned we see no such inconsistency. We have had inflation decelerating in a period of hyper demand because of our wage, fiscal and monetary policies. We do not see any conflict at all in a proper operating accord mechanism, monetary policy and fiscal policy. The Leader of the National Party talks about conflicts in policy, but the parties within the coalition cannot agree about a policy. At the last Question Time I trotted out three utterances by the Leader of the National Party which were at cross purposes with utterances by the Leader of the Opposition. Given the fact that those opposite always want us to make statements, why does the Leader of the Opposition not call a press conference, instead of giving doorstop interviews every day, to tell us how he is going to take the weight off monetary policy and put it on to fiscal policy when we have bill rates at 12.4 per cent? Does he believe that we can have a much lower rate of interest and still control inflation and wages with bill rates dramatically below 12.4 per cent? In his response to the Special Premiers Conference he said that we needed, as the Prime Minister said earlier, a Federal Budget. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The major disappointment of the Special Premiers Conference, therefore, is the failure of the Prime Minister to deal with the issue of winding back public sector spending.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have Commonwealth Budget outlays at 1973 levels, heading for 1950s levels, but the major failure, he said, was in winding back public spending. At the same time he is proposing a weakening of fiscal policy through tax giveaways and capital gains tax. I know that the Leader of the Opposition cannot cop it, so he has turned his back on us. If he wants to make this cowardly function a permanent feature of Question Time, he can do so. He asks questions, but he does not like the answers.</PARA>
<PARA> He wants to strengthen fiscal policy by giving a seven-year, backdated capital gains tax giveaway. He wants to reduce the top marginal rate of tax. Therefore, he wants to put more weight on fiscal policy while arguing to us that it ought to be weakened. He wants to take the weight off interest rates, yet throughout last year he was telling us that interest rates were not high enough. He now believes that we can take the weight off interest rates and give us an inflation rate comparable to that of the rest of the world, with interest rates dramatically below 12.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Leader of the Opposition: Why do you not answer a few of these hard questions at a press conference? Tell us what the rate of tax on your consumption tax is, or what the compensation details are. In other words, do not display cowardice at the front door for a minute every day. I call press conferences of 60 to 90 minutes duration. I called a press conference the other day which lasted for 52 minutes, and one before that lasted for 90 minutes. The Prime Minister calls them every week. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: When did you last call a press conference? When did you last tell us what your policies are? Before Opposition members trot out Mr Loton, they should make sure that they get their own policies in place and, when they do, they should tell us about them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some time there has been a lack of clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of the Federal, State and Territory governments in the field of disability services. This has led to a replication of activity, confusion for consumers and service providers and gaps in service provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The June meeting of the Council of Social Welfare Ministers agreed to establish a working party to develop a national framework for the funding and operation of disability services. Last month the working party produced a detailed report recommending that the Federal Government assume responsibility for the funding and administration of employment services for people with disabilities, that the States assume responsibility for the funding and administration of accommodation support, respite care, information, independent living training, recreation and print disability services, and that both levels of government remain involved in funding advocacy services and in the conduct of disability research and development.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the extraordinarily successful Premiers Conference adopted an agreed framework and process for the urgent resolution of disability issues. The communique from the conference contained the unanimous agreement that:</PARA>
<PARA>In future the State governments should be responsible for accommodation services and the Commonwealth Government for employment related services with the States passing complementary legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>I underline this point-</PARA>
<PARA>so that all governments will operate within principles and objectives consistent with those of the Commonwealth's Disability Services Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Dawson would be very interested in that remark. This agreement is historic not just for the resolution of the rules and responsibilities in disability services but because it commits all governments to the principles and objectives of our disability reform agenda as contained in the Disability Services Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The deadline for the Opposition is Thursday. Here we are with a Disability Services Act that is controversial. As a government we have been taking on a very difficult issue, an issue which has required reform and has required a fair go for those people in the community who most deserve the response and support of this Government. We have been doing that at a time of fiscal restraint. We have put our legislation and our resources into that program. In the most recent Budget we announced a massive expansion of our support in the area of disability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even though we have agreement between the Commonwealth and each of the States, rather than the Opposition supporting that in this Parliament it seems completely isolated on this issue and on so many other questions of social policy and social justice. It wants to delay, obstruct and amend the very disability reform agenda and legislation that all governments-Commonwealth and State-agree provides an appropriate framework for the provision of disability services in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA> In this area of disability we have a very clear contrast between the Government and the Opposition. We have the Government defining after review a very significant legislative change in terms of the Disability Services Act. That Act obviously requires very significant change in terms of the sector. It is controversial and a number of organisations are obviously concerned and are debating the issues involved. When it comes to the crunch each of the States, together with the Commonwealth, can agree on the basis of the legislation-that is, they can agree on principle. As far as the Opposition is concerned, when there is a bit of heat on in Dawson the honourable member for Dawson jumps. He jumps to try to respond to sectional interests and particular groups rather than seeking to support the Act and legislation which have been agreed to by the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>

It is just one of the many steps in the micro-economic reform area that this Government has taken over the years and continues to take, and will be the subject of statements later by the Prime Minister. But I do not think that there is any area more significant in micro-economic reform than the area of railways reform.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is long overdue, as the Leader of the National Party says. I think all honourable members here are aware that there are, at least potentially and in theory, very substantial advantages for rail transport in the carriage of bulkier types of cargo. But that has never been realised in this country. The reasons why we have not been able to secure those cost advantages go to several things, one of them being work practices and management practices in the various rail systems and another being the fact that there are effectively five rail systems operating in this country. As a result of inefficiencies in those two areas, there has been a disincentive to governments, State and Federal, over the years to invest properly in key elements of the rail infrastructure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Rail Freight Corporation follows from an examination by the Commonwealth Government, with the States, of a National Freight Initiative Committee. What they have indicated as the basis for the operation of that Corporation is a requirement to spend some $800m over five years; about $300m in higher return strategic investments, including terminal facilities, communications and traffic management systems, and about $500m in improving identified high priority track renewals and locomotive replacement.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there is also a recognition, and a recognition amongst those forming the Corporation, that this capital expenditure simply is not sufficient in terms of delivering the services that are required. Management and work practices need to be improved. The integrated management of interstate freight movements is going to be necessary and will be a feature of that Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> The plan for the Corporation does envisage its moving into surplus by 1993-94 with internally generated funds supplemented by outside finance on commercial terms. The Corporation would then be able to meet its further capital needs. So the reform of Australia's interstate rail freight will improve the ability of our enterprises to produce on an internationally competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Commission estimates that the freight initiative, if implemented, should boost gross domestic product by at least $1.4 billion a year. Another figure that is worth contemplating in that regard is a saving to the taxpayer by a reduction of what are effectively State deficits in this area of some $370m which would eventuate from an effectively operating Corporation in line with that initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> These proposals are yet another example of the processes of the Special Premiers Conference and the processes of this Government in getting the runs on the board in the micro-economic reform area, in steadily going through the hard, difficult process of planning micro-economic reform and introducing micro-economic reform in our country over the years. It is a contrast, which other Ministers on this side of the House have been referring to, on the one hand of sensible, planned, well thought out reform as opposed to the floating of balloons as a process by which we go about policy making in this the premier public policy institution in the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not making any demand upon the Trades Hall Council in this matter. I simply make the point, as I have in regard to all industrial disputes, that where there is a dispute situation I would rather that it be resolved without recourse to force on either side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are in a position where, after being in government for 7 1/2 years, it is really no good for the honourable member to pick out one isolated instance and suggest that there has not been an infinite improvement in the industrial relations framework environment and practices in this country since this Government has been in office.</PARA>
<PARA> It is all too often the case that one takes only one test of what is happening in the industrial relations environment, and that test is the level of industrial disputes. Nevertheless, taking that test for a start, let me make the point that there has been a nearly 60 per cent reduction in the level of industrial disputes in the period of this Government, compared with the period when the honourable member was in office, including the period when, amongst his darting around from portfolio to portfolio, just for a brief while he had control of industrial relations.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, what we have done in this country is to have a sea change in the industrial relations environment. I am not avoiding the particular question. I am putting it in the context that this Government, as in so many areas, as has been indicated by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications, who has just resumed his seat, has gone about the undramatic but hard job of reshaping institutions and attitudes in this country which had brought this country down. Industrial relations is one of the outstanding areas where this has been done.</PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that in an infinitely improved industrial relations environment there are not circumstances which we deplore. The honourable member for Kooyong referred to the dispute which relates to the Hoechst company. Recently I have been engaged in discussions with people who have been concerned about the situation in regard to the Leighton building site in St Kilda Road. We deplore what is happening there. I hope in regard to this dispute, which goes to a matter of fundamental concern for workers, that is, health and safety practices within an enterprise-and there is no doubt that there is some cause for concern-that these legitimately and strongly held concerns of the workers will be capable of being resolved in a way which is not going to lead to further disputation.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not like the elements of the dispute to which the honourable gentleman has referred. I think he has known me long enough to know that I do not like those sorts of things. I do not think, however, that my standing here and issuing some instruction, as the honourable gentleman suggests, would really bring any change to the situation. If I were to stand here and say, `I instruct the Trades Hall Council to do X,Y, and Z', he knows that that would be neither within my purview nor would it be anything other than be counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA> I call upon both sides in this dispute to recognise that there is a serious issue of concern on the part of the workers. The workers should realise that it is important, so far as the security of their employment and economic growth in Victoria are concerned, that we cannot afford to have closedowns of important enterprises. I hope good sense will prevail on the part of management, the workers directly concerned, and the Victorian Trades Hall Council.</PARA>

I have visited a lot of military bases over the last six months and talked to more spouses of more members of the armed forces than I guess there are members of this House. They all wanted to talk to me about the problems which their children face on moving between schools and school systems when they are posted, as they are, on average, once every couple of years. Those families rated their No. 1 problem as coping with different school starting ages, different curricula and even different handwriting styles. Honourable members can imagine how unimpressed they are that the State education systems cannot get their collective act together and that their children's education is suffering as a consequence. It is a problem, I might add, that my predecessors, the honourable member for Canberra and the honourable member for Calare, raised continuously. My colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training recognised that frequent movement between schools and school systems affects a much larger group of children than those of the ADF members and he has been trying to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is one area where the Premiers continue to talk about States rights and the Opposition indeed has no policy whatever. The Minister's State Premier says that she believes Mr Dawkins is trying to impose Federal supervision and to control standards. What I clearly understood that he was proposing was that the Australian Education Council, which represents Federal, State and Territory education Ministers, get together and develop national school standards, a national approach. Indeed, I saw it reported that the Premier of Victoria thinks the States are in a position to know what the requirements of the community are. There is one part of the community I am very familiar with and its requirements are not being met. The ADF families are realistic enough not to expect a national curriculum, a national handwriting style and common school starting ages by next Monday morning, but they would like to see some realistic, tangible effort from the State systems in this direction. In the interim, they would like to see some flexibility within the schools and within school systems in accommodating their children's needs. Mr Speaker, might I say to members of the House that if it were their kids they would think it was at least as important as whether the train tracks were the same gauge on each side of the border.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I have noticed considerable media comment on this question of the turnout of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in relation to the first election for regional councils that was held on Saturday. I can advise the honourable member that the Australian Electoral Commission advised me yesterday that the number of votes received for the first election totalled 38,042. This represents 33.34 per cent of the estimated 114,000 eligible voters in the regions where the elections were required. I might say that this turnout compares very favourably with turnouts in relation to non-compulsory elections in other jurisdictions in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I could inform the House by way of three examples, the position is that local government elections in the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania are in fact non-compulsory and arguably can provide a realistic comparison with the turnout in relation to the ATSIC elections. I am advised that the turnout for the local government elections in South Australia has ranged from 14.8 per cent to a peak of 20.1 per cent in 1989. I could also say that that latter figure was mainly stimulated by a high turnout in one area where there was high interest in an issue of controversy--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the honourable member's own electorate, as he acknowledges. In relation to Tasmania, the honourable member for Franklin may be interested to know that the voter turnout is generally around 18 per cent, and in Western Australia in 1989 it was 15.3 per cent. These figures, of course, are considerably lower than those for the ATSIC elections, and it is also important to point out that local government elections involve a generally well educated, compact voting population and a long established and well known institution. In contrast, the ATSIC elections involved many remote communities and a group of Australians for whom illiteracy can be a serious problem, and that is of course regrettably because of a lower standard of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, it is important to highlight the obvious fact that ATSIC is a very new body and, with these factors taken into account, it can be, I believe, truly said that ATSIC is off to a very important and promising first start. As I have said on other occasions-and I do not include the honourable member in this description-the turnout for the ATSIC election was a rebuttal to the prophets of doom who have sought from day one to suggest that the new Commission will not be a successful body. I say to the Opposition, I can but hope and indeed wish that it will continue to play what has been up until now, I think, a reasonably constructive role in giving ATSIC what the Sunday Territorian described in a recent editorial as a chance.</PARA>

<PARA> To put this in context, I think that we should try to understand the Opposition's latest pathetic announcement for the paucity of policy thinking that it reveals on its side, because Opposition members have veered from one policy extreme to the other. When they were in government, they took the view that business needed to be protected by high tariff levels-and what that did was stifle innovation and stifle global development. Now, having had the opportunity to do something when they were in government, they are telling us that we should leave everything to the market-including research and development, I might add. In their view, there is no role for government in encouraging industry's use of science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition's policy of leaving research and development to the market was announced, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies-that is, FASTS, the representative body of the scientific and technological community in this country-asked the question: Do we really need a shadow Minister for science and technology? We may well ask that.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me just point to the contrast between this Government's approach and that of the previous Government. We have introduced a number of policy initiatives that have led to growth in private sector R and D in this country, including 150 per cent tax deductibility, the grants for industry, research and development-that is, GIRD-and the connection between agencies, such as universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and the private sector. When we came to power, the contribution of the private sector as a proportion of gross domestic product to R and D was 0.2 per cent. Under this Government, it has risen to almost 0.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Research and development performance by the private sector in this country-the honourable member for Gippsland ought to take notice of this before he starts spouting off-has trebled in value since 1981-82 when the Opposition was in power to $1.6 billion and total expenditure on research and development has increased over the same period by more than 50 per cent to almost $4.2 billion. Importantly, the Government's contribution to funding science and research in this country saw the last Budget contribute 2.3 per cent growth in real outlays to that area against general outlays cuts of 0.6 per cent. The figure of 2.3 per cent growth does not include the $100m for the cooperative research centres.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, therefore, proud of what it has been able to achieve in terms of R and D being increased by the private sector, but it is not stopping there. In the last election campaign, the Prime Minister announced the intention to establish the cooperative research centres program. This is a program to forge more effective links between our research effort and that of the private sector. Over the course of the next three years we will commit an additional $100m to fund research programs and activities that meet the criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> The deadline for the closure of the first round of applications was last Wednesday. I am pleased at the response because we had more than 120 applications. They embraced many fields of science and technology and their application, including agriculture, mineral processing, computing and robotics, new materials, waste management, the environment and medicine and health. Of these 120 applications, the private sector is contributing to more than half.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of the Government now is to select from that 120 the first 15 successful applications. It will be ably assisted in that task by the content and composition of the selection process. Sectors of industry as well as the science community will be involved in that selection process, and they will report to Government on the recommendation of the first 15. The quality of the applications is excellent. It does demonstrate that the private sector is continuing to lift its game, but it has done so only because we have been prepared to give it encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA> From time to time, the Opposition ought to reflect on its pathetic approach to this effort and to realise why we have been so badly served by innovation in this country and so bad at carving out market niches. It has never created a framework to encourage innovation. This Government is doing so and the Opposition should be applauding it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister with responsibility for Australia Post and I ask: Is it true that the Government has endorsed Australia Post's stamp issue policy that precludes the depiction of anniversaries or events connected with political parties? Is it true that as a consequence of this policy the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has been denied its request for a commemorative stamp to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Party in 1991? Is such a policy not a slap in the face for the ALP? What rationale is there for this nineteenth century policy that refuses to recognise the contribution, or indeed even the existence, of political parties in our system? Why are the Young Men's Christian Association, the Country Women's Association, the Australian Natives Association, Lions, Rotary, Apex, Jaycees, the British and Foreign Bible Society, et cetera, worthy of philatelic recognition while the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia are not? Why is a stamp issue honouring the political parties any more controversial than the issuing of stamps honouring the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Sydney Stock Exchange, Billy Hughes, Joe Lyons-or, presumably under this Government, Bob Menzies or Gough Whitlam? Is it correct that, if-in this regard-a more enlightened government is elected at the next election, we may well see the Liberal Party with a stamp commemorating its fiftieth anniversary in 1994?</PARA></TALK.START>

But the honourable member raised a good point. I had meant to take it up with my colleague who is responsible for Australia Post and I will do so.

I was misrepresented in the following fashion. Soon after the appointment of the Minister I raised with him privately the Opposition's concerns about the implementation of the Bill and drew his attention to a draft Bill, which is a Bill for discussion that was lodged in this House last November. Obviously he has anticipated that the contents of that Bill will be the same as those of the Bill to be presented on Thursday. Until Thursday nobody has the right to anticipate that Bill or make charges against the Opposition and me personally in that regard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you need only read today's papers to sense the despair and desperation emanating from the back bench and the front bench of this tired Labor Government. I picked up a copy of the Daily Telegraph Mirror and read this heading: `How I ruined the country'. I thought, `Crikey, Bob or Paul must have given a refreshing statement of honesty'. I picked up a copy of the Canberra Times and saw this heading: `Keating to Government: don't panic'. I picked up a copy of the Melbourne Age and saw this heading: `Cabinet told to go on attack'. I picked up a copy of the Australian Financial Review-probably by mistake-and saw a complimentary remark about the Treasurer (Mr Keating) from one of his greatest supporters. I picked up a copy of the Australian and saw this headline: `PM tells ministers to lift game as jobless fears rise'. That, I might say, is the signal and the pointer to the soft political underbelly of this Government, as unemployment rises. Lastly, of course, I saw this headline in the Sydney Morning Herald: `Jobs crisis: PM tells ministers to be calm'. Well might the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tell them to be calm, as this Government is clearly in a state of drawn out crisis. It has deliberately engineered a recession. It will not, or cannot, admit-and is certainly not man enough to admit-its failures, and the economy is deteriorating fast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Gathering over this home-grown recession are three dark clouds that reveal how vulnerable Mr Recession's policies have made us. The world's boom of eight years duration is finally coming to an end. The latest evidence of that is shown in the expectations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development of a fall in exports. I ask: On this first day of the resumption of sittings, where is the Treasurer? Where is the man who should stand here and account for the dismal failure of his policies?</PARA>
<PARA> The second dark cloud overhanging this country relates to the future of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round, very important that it is, and which is obviously very shaky at this stage. The third cloud, of course, is the Gulf crisis. That is already having some impact on the Australian economy, although I suspect that tomorrow's figures on the consumer price index will have been quarantined by the Treasurer's 30 or 60 day freeze; all the same, holding out a real prospect of a fillip to inflation for the world economy and a fall back in economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of all that, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer basically say, `Don't panic'. They say, `Steady as she goes'. They say, `The policy is working'. Instead of acknowledging our problems they downplay our problems. Instead of grasping the opportunity for some radical change, they say, `Sit tight'. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of example, this morning the Prime Minister was communicating after yesterday's Cabinet meeting. I thought that what he had to say was depressing in the extreme. Look what he said about GATT. His view on GATT was, `We've done all that we can'. That was it; nothing more can be done. My colleague the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) will expose that myth good and proper later in the debate. With regard to the farmers, in the face of the Minister responsible saying that we have a rural recession, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>I can't do anything more than we are on that ground. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that is it for the farmers. There may be a rural recession, but there is nothing from the Prime Minister to address the problems of rural Australia. With regard to micro reform, he has put together megacom. The Government has saved Joan Kirner's political neck in the short term. It is going to flog a few shares in the airlines. What does the Prime Minister say? He is going to sit back and rest on his laurels. With regard to interest rates-and I will be interested to hear the Treasurer's remarks about interest rates-the Prime Minister-and I ask the Treasurer to confirm this-said this morning:</PARA>
<PARA>We can't do anything more, in regard to the area of interest rates, then in this year there have been five successive reductions of interest rates and we can't do anything more in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it: we have the worst recession that this country has faced since the war and we have the Prime Minister saying on radio this morning that there is absolutely nothing that he can do by way of change of policy to address Australia's basic problems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have really run out of ideas, at a time when they need a bonfire under them to get some real change to economic policy. We need a medium term and a long term strategy to address Australia's problems. In response, what do we get from the Government? It goes back to the basics. It goes back to the three r's: `r' for recession, well, it brought that on; `r' for revision, which is revising history and putting the blame somewhere else. The Treasurer has started work on that. He is blaming wool and wheat. He gave a classic one the other day. He fell back on old Malcolm's dictum: Life was not meant to be easy. The third `r' in the return to basics is ridicule-ridicule your opponents. Instead of coming up with constructive alternatives, turn the attack on to the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister was half right when he talked about communication. He said that the Government needed to have better communication in respect of its policies. He is half right because instead of him talking to the electorate he ought to be listening to what the electorate has been saying. Then we might have some better appreciation by this Government of the disastrous nature of its policies and the damage caused by them. If we got a fair assessment of what was wrong and then stepped up to a recognition of the failure of policy, we would be two-thirds of the way to what we really need-that is, a major change in economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not listen to the Opposition, but for all its personal attacks we will not deviate from being constructive about the alternative solutions that ought to be addressed. The Treasurer ought to hear what some of the leading people in this community have been saying. I am referring to people such as Brian Quinn, Chairman and Chief Executive of Coles-Myer Ltd. He is a respected businessman in this country; a member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia. He described 1989-90 as `the most difficult period for the retail industry since the Second World War'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our sales in many areas virtually hit a brick wall when the Middle East crisis began. </PARA>
<PARA>Last month Coles-Myer reported its first profit fall since 1952. Over 8,000 em- ployees have been retrenched. Brian Loton, Managing Director of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and President of the Business Council of Australia, has said:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless we make some fundamental changes, we face the prospect of being a country in fundamental decline. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>So we have policies running at cross-purposes: on the one hand, a monetary policy to restrain inflation and demand, and on the other, a wages policy which could well be having the opposite effect. </PARA>
<PARA>We could look at the reported remarks of Sir Peter Finley of Email Ltd. Email reported a 57 per cent slump in September half-year earnings and said that there was little prospect of an improvement in trading conditions in the next six months. It has cut its work force by 750 since March. Inventory levels have been reduced and capital expenditure proposals redirected to provide some short term benefits. We could refer to Will Bailey. He runs one of our biggest banks and is in a good position to survey the economy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Put simply, we're experiencing a crisis of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>We could refer to Bernie Fraser, one of the Government's economic confidants, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The confidence factor . . . is pretty low among business people and among consumers, too. </PARA>
<PARA>His deputy, John Phillips, said that what we see from standing in Canberra is one thing but if we sit around a boardroom table in Melbourne we will know that we are in a severe recession. </PARA>
<PARA> We could refer to Ernst and Young, a major accountancy firm. It has a business stress index. Bob Dunn, the author of the report, says that in 1989-90 the number of stress sales across Australia rose by 66 per cent, with a whopping 163 per cent increase in Queensland. In Victoria and Tasmania it rose 123 per cent and in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory it rose 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Treasurer does not accept any of that anecdotal evidence he should talk to some of his own people. He should stop one of his own backbenchers in a corridor and ask what people are telling them. They will soon give him the truth. He does not need the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), Bob Carr or the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). The list is as long as his arm. Are all these people wrong? Is the Treasurer going to get up and say that all the leaders of the business community are wrong? Is he going to give the Archbishop a serve? Is he going to give his own back bench a serve? It is time that he realised that this economy is on a big slide. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the anecdotal evidence supported by the statistical evidence that those individual firms and people have. The Treasurer also ought to look at the statistics. We will be calling the Australian Bureau of Statistics the organisation for Australia's bad statistics. Day in, day out, it churns out the bad news about our economy. The job advertisements survey by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group is one example. That figure has dropped 60.1 per cent since the peak in April 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week the balance of payments reached $1 1/2 billion-a massive accumulation to our debt. It is very worrying that our exports were weak. We had a massive increase in the interest bill on our debt. Indigenous daily imports-routine imports-actually went up. That is a real sign for the Treasurer that his policies have failed. The recession was brought on to do something about the current account deficit, yet the latest figure is a massive $1 1/2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer can look at bankruptcies-25.8 per cent up in March-or at company profits, which are sliding fast. The Treasurer can look at inflation. We have a dismal record in this country on inflation. It is now 7.7 per cent; I do not know what it will be tomorrow, but I assure the Treasurer that it will continue to be high. Inflation in this country is one of the factors driving that massive debt, and we really ought to be doing something about it; we ought to get it down. The best that the Treasurer can do, as he is on the public record as saying, is about 6 per cent. Of course, as the accord is continued, that puts a floor on inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Job vacancies are the lowest since 1984. Labour force statistics indicate that unemployment is rising-7.3 per cent. As honourable members know, the unemployment figures are just about to break the Budget forecast later this week. The national accounts-another indicator-went backwards in June. In fact, we would have gone backwards in March except that a technical recession was avoided by government spending. Of course, investment in plant and equipment is just dropping like a stone-14 per cent in that 12-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that as I resume my seat the Treasurer will rise to respond and say that we are like pigs in slush and that we are trading on the gloom and doom. Let me just disabuse him of that. Our point is very simple: if we just had an honest and frank assessment of our problems, then we could gather the political constituency for radical change. In the national interest, if the Treasurer gets the policy changes half right, we will support him-and we have got the runs on the board in that respect, certainly since the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential of this country is fantastic. We have a great potential in this country with human and natural resources. We have got the whole game at our feet. But people are just sick with worry about the economic mismanagement and recession that the Government has brought on. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of changes could be made: for example, scrapping the leave loadings. It is just common sense that employers and employees should sit down together and ask themselves how they are going to save their jobs. The Treasurer should get up and tell us what is wrong with that. Every year the Treasurer says that he has cut fiscal policy to the bone. Every year within days we find evidence that the Treasurer has not gone as far as he could. This year, of course, Senator Walsh just blew the Treasurer's Budget apart. We offered the Government $3 billion worth of cuts for the last Budget, and the Treasurer did not have the political gumption to take these up. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great disappointments of the Special Premiers Conference is that the Treasurer did not sit down with the Premiers, grasp the nettle and move for significant cuts in expenditure across the three levels of government. In industrial relations, massive benefits are there for the taking. The benefits have been quantified. We have an economy of $360 billion to $370 billion. If we went to an enterprise focus, if the Government finally stood up to the trade union movement, we know that there would be $50 billion there. The Treasurer should consider the increase in family living standards there could be if the Government were prepared to make real changes in industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We need an anti-inflation strategy. The Government ought to scrap the accord. One person's wage increase is another person's job. We have been through that debate year after year since 1982-83, and the Government is about to run through the whole thing again. Another key element, in our view, for a decent anti-inflation strategy is real independence for the Reserve Bank of Australia. We should not be using the sole instrument of high interest rates as a backup for the failure of other policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could move to radical reform of the tax system to boost incentives for people to work, save, invest and export. If that is going to be achieved, the Government is going to have to bite the bullet, as we have done. We again offer it to the Government. I know that for political purposes, the Treasurer came out in May to oppose the goods and services tax. The Government still has a couple of years to go before it faces the people. It ought to do the right thing and use the tax system for radical reform. Of course, watching Labor get on with the long list of micro-reforms is like watching paint dry. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply saying that if the Treasurer now stands and responds initially with an outburst of personal abuse, which is how he usually responds to a matter of public importance, and then goes on to tell us that the policy is working, then I think he ought to do the right thing: brush up on his French, pack his clocks and go. </PARA>

It is understandable that people are frightened by an international development like that. But what does the Opposition want us to do? Wave a magic wand about it?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is like the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He got up here two weeks ago and said that $40 billion-that is nearly half the Budget-ought to be washed away to an aid agency. That $40 billion is paid under the social security system, which is staffed by people who are trained to be competent in dealing with people's problems. It is then related to a complex set of interrelating benefits and payments. When the honourable gentleman was attacked for saying that, he said, `I have been personally attacked'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are these people opposite? Talk about crossing the Rubicon in political sensitivity! The Leader of the Opposition puts up these vicious ideas, but when someone has the temerity to say that that is a shocking thing to do, he says, `Oh, I have been personally attacked', like a little boy, running away. He seems to think that that is some kind of defence. When he asks a question at Question Time, he then turns his back, in a cowardly way, into a conversation. If the honourable member wishes to behave like a ninny, he cannot complain. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have the Opposition crying about interest rates. Last year the Leader of the Opposition was saying that we should have higher interest rates. He said that I was interfering with the proper operations of the central bank, that that is why it should be independent, and that we should have higher interest rates. Now he is saying that there should be lower interest rates. We are seeing a lack of integrity on the part of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Leader of the Opposition is saying that we should put more weight on fiscal policy. How? These are the Opposition's great radical propositions at the moment: abolish the annual leave loading, which is a minuscule addition to on-costs in business; tear down the social security payments mechanism; contract out laundry and cleaning services; give the Reserve Bank a supposedly independent charter. These are the radical prescriptions the Opposition is putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is sitting upon the most substantial fiscal consolidation in general government budgets in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Opposition has the hide to say that we should put more burden on fiscal policy to have lower interest rates when it believes there should be a seven-year retrospective change to the tax system for people who have benefits locked up under the capital gains tax. The Opposition believes we should be able to cut the top marginal rate of tax, yet it believes there should be more fiscal monetary policy. What a lot of totally contradictory nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Opposition is just playing the same old game it has always played. It does not stand for decent policy; it stands for opportunism, whether it is Reds in sampans coming to get us, as we heard from Senator Carrick in the 1960s, or `Keep your money under your bed', as we heard from Malcolm Fraser in 1983. The Opposition says `You should put interest rates up higher because you are not meeting your fiscal and monetary responsibilities', but when they are up and induce a slowdown in the economy, the Opposition then complains about the unemployment levels and says that interest rates ought to be lower because the Government has not cut fiscal policy. In fact the Opposition left us with a yawning deficit. Those opposite lack any integrity and credibility. They make statements such as `It is the worst recession since the war', when in fact they know that they presided over the worst recession since the war. By every objective measurement, they presided over the worst recession since the Depression. The Opposition has said nothing of substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week we saw a report on the economy by BIS Shrapnel. I do not know whether Opposition members noticed it, but it said, `The Australian economy suffers from a long run productive supply weakness created over a number of decades'. We cannot pay for those imports because of the things the coalition parties did wrongly for the 30 years they were running Australia. We are trying to grapple with turning the economy from an inward, closed place with a managed exchange rate-a tariff wall we could not jump over-indifferent fiscal policy, enormous waste and abuse in the public expenditure system to an open, international economy which is engaging the rest of the world in trade. That change is going to take time, but it is going to succeed for Australia, by freeing up all of those areas of the micro-economy, not just the macro-economy, and making the kinds of changes we were making a week ago at the Special Premiers Conference. That is how we are going to get across the terrible legacy those opposite left to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's terrible legacy is of 30 years of basically making a mess. It watched our traded goods sector fall to pieces, our manufacturing skills go out the door, research and development hit the fence, and product innovation disappear while it relied upon commodities. Just as the adjustments were about to take place, along came the coal boom in the late 1970s and it said, `Happy days are here again! Sloth, sloth, sloth is in.' The economy stayed down until that stopped and we were left with nothing. As usual, it was left to the Australian Labor Party. We always have to be around. During the war we had to pick up the show from a coalition government. I mean, there it was, crippled by lack of imagination, creativity and cowardice. We had to pick up the show in the war just as we have had to pick it up after 30 years of indolent coalition government to try to turn around the--</PARA>

Yes, he gave a critique of the Menzies Government, a critique of every government in Australia, bar Labor governments, since 1901 and told of the terrible record of missed opportunities, even though under those governments Australia was one of the richest countries in the world, which of course it can no longer boast to be.

Weeks passed and then finally, three days before the election, he stood up in front of some shipyard workers in the United States and he mentioned the `l' word; he admitted what he was and what the Republicans had been saying. It is exactly the same for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with `recession', that `r' word. They never admit it. They never say it, and then one day when unemployment exceeds 10 per cent, when the economy is in a complete state of collapse, perhaps they too will admit what the `r' word really is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is a man who will not even go out into the community to find out what happens. I know that a lot of people are thinking that they read the other day in a newspaper that the Treasurer goes shopping in Big W in Manuka. Most people in Australia do not know about Manuka. For anybody who does know something about Canberra, Manuka is the Double Bay of the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, that is where the Treasurer would be found. He would not be found anywhere else, certainly not somewhere like his electorate, and indeed not even at his Elizabeth Bay home. </PARA>
<PARA> The real test of this Government and the real test for Australia is not, of course, the politics of abuse and smear and scare, the outcome of a ministerial meeting, a whole day spent planning new and interesting ways of denigrating the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others on this side of the House. The real test is whether this Government is capable now of resolving the fundamental problem that this country has, which is a balance of payments crisis coupled with a burgeoning foreign debt. That is the real test of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tried to solve the problem that it itself created by plunging the economy into recession, and yet we still have a projected balance of payments deficit of $18 billion for the next year with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) admitting on Sunday that those predictions could no longer be really taken very seriously. We have had a net foreign debt of $122 billion which has grown from $109 billion in the same period last year; we have $700 per head of the Australian population being spent every year on servicing debt; and we spend 20 per cent of our export income on servicing that debt. So the test is: Can this Government, with its policies, having pushed us into that position, help us to get out of it?</PARA>
<PARA> One thing that everybody in Australia needs to reflect on is that the economic crisis came about at a time of high commodity prices. We hear a lot from the other side of the House about the 1981-82 recession and how terrible things were, but it should never be forgotten that at that time this country had been through one of the worst droughts in its history and for the first time since the Second World War world trade actually contracted in 1981, so severe was the global recession. That is not the case today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had over the last few years the longest period of sustained economic growth around the world that the world has known since the Second World War. Even in those booming circumstances, at a time when commodity prices have been so high, we have this chronic balance of payments problem and this burgeoning foreign debt. It is worth remembering that just to stabilise that debt we have to transfer 4 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP) into the export sector over the next five years. We have not done it since the Second World War and we have to do it over the next five years just to stabilise our debt. That is a projection based on the high commodity prices that we had last year, but when we actually sit down and look at what is happening in the world we can see that the party of high commodity prices is finally over. We have the Persian Gulf crisis and a Budget that the Government brought down projecting an average oil price of $23 a barrel, which even the Minister for Finance now admits, even the Government itself now admits, is an optimistic projection. It clearly is not going to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the Prime Minister this morning on the AM program saying to people, effectively, `Don't worry too much about the Persian Gulf crisis; we are a net energy exporter'. But we are a commodity exporter and the problem for us is that as oil prices around the world go up, so in turn, in time, commodity prices will go down-just as they did in 1973 and just as they did in 1978-79. So for every $5 increase in the oil price above that $23-a-barrel estimate, we end up with another $1 billion added to our balance of payments deficit because of the decline in commodity prices. And look what is happening to commodity prices. The Commodity Research Board figures show that over the last two weeks commodity prices have fallen by 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The American economy is falling into recession, as the 3 per cent decline in the manufacturing work force in the United States has shown in the latest figures. Germany is struggling with the process of reunification. Add then, on top of all of those problems, the crisis in the world trading system which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), referred to earlier-the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks which are on the verge of a breakdown. We have the very real prospect now of a move towards trade wars, a move towards higher protectionism, and we have already seen the United States using the export enhancement program, subsidising and dumping wheat onto other markets in order to take on the European Community in connection with the common agricultural policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have all of those problems coming now at a time when our economy could not be more vulnerable. We could not be more vulnerable. We have done so badly with high commodity prices and buoyant global conditions, whatever is going to happen to this country now that the global economy is turning down? The Government has not taken up any of the propositions that this side of the House has put forward for reform of the industrial relations system, for reform of taxation, or for proper reform in transport, telecommunications, shipping and the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Government says, `We've done something; things are not quite what they were 10, 15 or 20 years ago'. It is true. Every government, however bad it is-and this Government would have to be about the worst ever-does something. But the test is: Has this Government's rate of change been as fast and effective as the rate of change in other parts of the world? It is on that test that this Government has failed and failed so dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> Waterfront productivity is expected to improve, according to the Government's own figures, by 30 per cent over the next three years. But Britain has improved its productivity on the waterfront by 65 per cent in one year, and little old New Zealand improved its productivity by 100 per cent in one year. Even in three years time, we will be further behind where New Zealand and Britain were if we are comparing 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> So the simple fact is that as a country we are going backwards very fast in relation to the world, and are in a state of very frightening vulnerability. Unless the Government takes the opportunity dramatically to change the direction of its economic policy, these beginnings of a recession-and it is a recession-are going to get terribly worse and every single Australian will suffer through lower living standards, loss of employment, loss of future opportunities and a decline in prospects simply because the Government ran away from the issues which it found too hard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to the hollow rhetoric of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who has put forward this matter of public importance today, and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), these two great spokesmen for the Opposition, it is pretty easy to understand why the galleries are empty. They have flailed the Government because they say the Government will not admit we are in a recession, and they have attacked the Government by saying that we have deliberately brought about a recession. The basic problem for them is that the economy is not in a recession. If our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and our Treasurer (Mr Keating) were to hit the panic button like honourable members opposite and appear on television and say, `The country is in a recession; what can be done?', that would simply drive the economy into a recession. We would end up producing the very thing which honourable members opposite are trying to bring about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite dismiss that as not being true. They say we are in a recession. They say that this Government-to use their words-has brought about the worst recession since the war. That is simply not true and they know that is not true, if they have any understanding at all of the economic statistics. The reason why that is not true is that the economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. We certainly have had that situation once in the Australian economy since the Second World War, but honourable members opposite seem to have forgotten the one occasion when that happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why members opposite might have forgotten that is that it was the period when their side of politics was in power. In the 1982-83 period under the Fraser Government, under the government of the Liberal and National parties, there were not two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth, not three, but four-four in a row when the Australian economy actually contracted. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had simply one quarter of negative economic growth-not four, as honourable members opposite brought about, but one quarter of negative economic growth-and suddenly honourable members opposite are hitting the panic button. They are saying that the Government should be on television declaring, `The country is in a mess, and we do not know what to do'. That is what they are telling us to do-that is probably what the Fraser Government did in 1982-83 to make it worse-when the fact is we are not in a recession. It would be the height of irresponsibility for this Government to try to inflame the concerns that are there now, because it would simply make the situation worse.</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition really does have a hide to attack this Government by saying that the interest rates under this Government have brought about a recession because, as we all know, 12 months ago the honourable member for Wentworth, the current Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), was in this Parliament criticising our Treasurer and our Prime Minister for allegedly manipulating interest rates. The Opposition's side of politics was saying to us that we had artificially lowered interest rates, that the right thing to do economically was to raise interest rates, and that we should fix up the Australian economy by making interest rates higher; yet they come in here today and say that we have engineered a recession-these people who were saying that interest rates should have been higher still. I just think they do not understand the connection between interest rates and economic activity but, given their past performance in other areas, I can understand why that might be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We of course have a few other statistics which members of the Opposition conveniently forget. They claim that we are in a recession, but of course they are not able to mention basic statistics such as housing starts. What happened under the Fraser-Howard years in housing in Australia? The best the Opposition ever achieved in its seven years in government was only 108,000 new starts. At the moment, this year it is expected there will not be 108,000 as occurred under the Fraser years-under this Government, in a period which those opposite say is a recession, there will be 130,000 housing starts. In fact, we got as high as 180,000 starts, which was not good for our building industry because we had too many houses being built-which is why this Government had to raise interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says we are in the worst recession since the Second World War, when only 130,000 homes will be built this year and the best the Opposition ever achieved in the seven years of its Government was a measly 108,000. So really it is a bit hard for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to claim that this is the worst recession since the Second World War, when we are building a lot more houses this year than the best year under the Fraser-Howard Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo made a big song and dance about our balance of payments problems, saying how terrible it was and that he cannot see any solution approaching. Of course I would simply refer him to the most recent economic statistics that have been brought out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They show that for the September quarter imports were down 17 per cent-and exports were down 7 per cent, of course, with the fall in commodity prices. So honourable members opposite say, `There's nothing happening; hit the panic button; we don't know what to do' when in fact the Government is doing the things that need to be done to fix up those balance of payments difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps as a member of the Government I could simply ask honourable members opposite one question: What are the different policy alternatives that you are putting forward to solve the problems that you have highlighted? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke for 15 minutes and he did not seem to get around to telling us what he might do differently. I listened very closely. Members of the Opposition seem to get the opportunity to move one of these matters of public importance once a week. Maybe next time, they might tell us one or two things that they might do differently if they had their hands on the levers of this economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask Opposition members where they would differ from us on interest rates. Today they tell us that they would have interest rates lower than the Government has set them; a year ago they told us that they would have had interest rates higher than the Government had set them. This is a flip-flop. They respond to whatever their opinion pollsters are telling them. As far as I am concerned, that is no recipe for a balanced, tough monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> They might tell us where they would differ on fiscal policy. Perhaps they would tell us that they would have a tougher fiscal policy. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders, nods his head. He is the man who, in this House and in the House of Representatives chamber in the old Parliament House, week after week flayed the Government over the assets test, saying how terrible it was. The conservative parties said that it was terrible to make rich people pay their own way instead of bludging on the rest of the community. The people who were not tough enough to support an assets test are trying to tell us that they would make the tough economic decisions necessary for a tight fiscal policy. I do not believe them. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the same people who say that they will abolish the capital gains tax to give their mates in the upper income brackets a tax cut. These are the people who one day say that they will abolish the Department of Social Security but, when they get a reaction, suddenly reverse that policy stance too. There is no consistency, no toughness and, certainly, no suggestion at all that they would have the tough fiscal policy they are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> They say that wages is another area in which they would be different. They would deregulate wage fixing, abolish centralised wage fixing and abolish the accord. I suggest that anyone who has any doubts about the ability of powerful unions to win large wage increases only need read the papers to see what is happening in Australia at the moment. Employers do not seem to like the latest round of the accord. But it is interesting to see how easily they are giving in to requests from unions for pretty substantial wage increases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what happens with the law of the jungle. The powerful unions get the biggest increases. That is the sort of system we would end up with under the deregulated policy that the Opposition puts forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that is not enough to convince the Opposition parties how crazy deregulated wage systems are, I ask them to look at Maggie Thatcher, their pin-up girl in the United Kingdom. What is happening to wages in the United Kingdom under the deregulated heaven that she has set up? The country is heading for 11 per cent inflation this year. A wages explosion is now taking place. That is the effect of market forces. The conservatives say that the explosion is nothing to worry about, because it is only a reflection of the market forces. A wages explosion in Australia now is the last thing we need. The alternative wages policy that the Opposition is putting forward of no controls and no centralised wage fixing would be a recipe for an absolute disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion in the letter put forward by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) asks the Government to undertake a radical change in economic policy. Where has he been for the last seven years? The dollar has been floated, even though people such as John Stone, the former guru of the National Party of Australia, argued when he was in the bureaucracy that it would be a terrible thing for Treasurer Keating to float the dollar. We have had banking deregulation after the Fraser-Howard Government baulked at the micro-economic reforms that this Government has introduced. We have had airline deregulation, although people such as the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) tried this and failed in the Fraser Government. We have had improvements on the waterfront and in shipping. We have had the announcement of the creation of the National Rail Freight Corporation in the last two weeks. Of course, we have also had massive reforms in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> What alternative does the Opposition offer? It offers a consumption tax, but the rate at which it will be set is secret. It will not tell us that until it gets into government. It will not tell us whom it will compensate or how it will compensate pensioners with savings put aside when their savings are devalued through the consumption tax, yet it tells us not to worry because everything will be sorted out when it gets into government. I am afraid that the Australian people are going to wait a long time before they get to see the sort of crazy things the Opposition would do, because it will not get into government for a long time to come. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 17 September 1990, the House referred to the Committee of Privileges a letter of 6 September 1990 from Mr A. Elder, of Dunhill Madden Butler, to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). The honourable member had raised the matter on 13 September. His concerns followed a statement in Mr Elder's letter asking him not to distribute further a circular letter Mr Scholes had sent to members of the Australian Labor Party in his electorate, to tell those to whom he had distributed it that it should be put to one side and to refrain from making such statements in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This letter went on to say that if the assurances and information sought were not forthcoming, he-Mr Elder-would do the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strongly advise my client to put to one side past associations and friendship, and initiate proceedings . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In raising the matter, the honourable member for Corio expressed his concern that if he were to comply with the threat contained in the letter, he would be inhibited and prevented in future from carrying out his duties as a member of this Parliament. This would prevent the Parliament from having his services on a basis which he would think was right and proper. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential question for determination by the Committee can be put as follows: Did the action of Mr Elder in writing to the honourable member for Corio in the terms that he did in the letter complained of constitute a contempt? There was no suggestion that the actions of the honourable member in publishing his letter to members of his Party in his electorate were absolutely privileged-that is, immune. The honourable member confirmed his awareness of this in his evidence to the Committee. The substance of his concern was, rather, his belief that if he complied with the requests Mr Elder made of him, he would be inhibited in carrying out his duties as a member. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there was no question that the actions of the honourable member in circulating his letter were not absolutely privileged, the House does, indeed, have the power to do the following under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to protect a member from conduct which amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free performance by the member of his or her duties as a member. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee appreciated the honourable member's perception of the matter. He regards himself as having duties to his electorate and responsibilities in so far as the issue which gave rise to his letter is concerned. The nub of the matter was seen by the Committee as the statement by Mr Elder that the honourable member for Corio should `refrain from making such statements in the future' and whether this constituted improper interference. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstance and having regard to the nature of the letter itself and the words actually used, the Committee has concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to lead it to a conclusion that the particular statement should be found to constitute an attempt by improper means to influence Mr Scholes in respect of his participation in proceedings in Parliament. Therefore, the Committee found that Mr Elder's action in writing to Mr Scholes in the terms that he did in his letter of 6 September did not constitute a contempt and, in view of this finding, it recommends that the House take no further action on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When this matter was referred to the Committee, the Speaker expressed the view that it was a borderline case on which the House would benefit from the advice of the Committee. The Committee certainly appreciates Mr Scholes's perception of the matter. Viewing it as he did, it was right and proper for him to bring the matter to the attention of the House. Nevertheless, for the reasons noted, the Committee has found that no contempt has been committed. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Borneo Barracks, Cabarlah, Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>The Borneo Barracks at Cabarlah near Toowoomba in Queensland were first established during World War II for use by the 11th Light Horse and various military schools and depots. Since then a variety of regiments and squadrons have operated from the Borneo Barracks and today they are home to the 7 Signal Regiment, a troop of 140 Signal Squadron, Army Reserve, and the Joint Telecommunications School (JTS). The JTS was formed and located at Cabarlah in 1986 as the result of a review into combined services signals training needs in 1985 and a review earlier this year reconfirmed that Cabarlah was still the preferred location. The Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy have relocated staff from various locations since 1986 to train at the school. </PARA>
<PARA> Some existing facilities at the base have been around since the base was first established whilst others have been added or upgraded during works undertaken in 1960 and 1976. Staff at the base currently total 420 service personnel, 15 civilians and 160 students. It is expected that personnel numbers will increase to 718 service and 25 civilian personnel by 1995, including up to 230 students at any given time. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed redevelopment of the base is aimed at upgrading existing facilities to provide sufficient and appropriate training, working and living accommodation for functions currently undertaken at the base and to accommodate the anticipated increase in staff and students expected between now and 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, the works will involve the provision of purpose designed training facilities for the school and upgrading of working facilities for support functions. Additional living accommodation for all ranks as well as rank and file dining and recreation facilities are also included. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimate for these works is $12.71m at August 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in 1992, with completion expected in 1995. I table selected drawings of the proposed redevelopment work at Cabarlah and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

He will, of course, be on the Public Works Committee and will, I am sure, be very keen to see this development go ahead. It is also worth mentioning in passing that, while it is expected that there will be an increase in the number of staff and students between now and 1995, it is also anticipated that there will probably be a net drop of about 135 in the civilian staff that will be operating there. While certainly the Opposition would be keen to see this go ahead subject to Public Works Committee approval, we understand that the anticipated cost of $12.7m is in fact less than was originally intended.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill will see Australia contribute $45m over the next five years to underwrite the activities of yet another international financial institution, the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). This brings to seven the total number of such institutions that Australia supports. The EBRD will take over some of the World Bank's responsibilities in eastern Europe, even though the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will continue major programs of structural adjustment lending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The World Bank has already greatly expanded its activities in eastern Europe, having allocated $US8 billion for loans to the region over the next three years. Honourable members may be aware of the numerous criticisms that have been made of the World Bank and its affiliates in this and other places on previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> If our experience of the World Bank group is anything to go by, we should hold grave misgivings about our contribution to yet another international financial institution. Not surprisingly, the EBRD is already exhibiting some of the many undesirable characteristics of the World Bank and the regional development banks. One looks in vain for some acknowledgment of the failings of the World Bank, or the embodiment of something of the global trend towards the divorce of the state from all but minimum regulation of economic affairs. After all, the genesis of this Bank is to be found in the rejection of central planning in eastern Europe. But there is only a half-hearted recognition of the importance of the private sector by the EBRD, which fails to come to grips with the fundamental flaws that reside in the sort of government sponsored financial assistance that these institutions dispense. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank reflects a compromise between the United States of America and the United Kingdom on the one hand, which wanted an exclusive focus on the private sector, and, on the other hand, the French who have been the main sponsors of the bank. This compromise means that 60 per cent of the bank's activities are to be directed `to the private sector and to assist the privatisation of state-owned enterprises' while a maximum of 40 per cent will be allocated to the state sector in each country assisted. That which is allocated to the state sector is supposed to assist industries that are deemed to be moving towards denationalisation and demonopolisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the circumstances it would have been an act of outrageous ignorance for the new bank not to have an explicit commitment of some sort to the private sector. But, as we shall see, this commitment does not amount to much. Assistance to the state sector in eastern Europe, even for the worthy goals to which the EBRD claims to aspire, is a highly questionable exercise. This is because the pressure for privatisation and deregulation in eastern Europe is coming principally from the monumental failings of central planning. Eastern Europe is riddled with decrepit nationalised firms and industries looking for any stay of execution that they can possibly find. Assistance for the purposes of so-called adjustment to private ownership and competition could well turn out to be nothing more than props for inefficient industries that stand in the way of economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Melanie Tammen of the CATO Institute has noted in her study of the World Bank assistance to eastern Europe:</PARA>
<PARA>With large amounts of external assistance . . . it will be exceedingly difficult for eastern Europe's new governments to direct resources away from entrenched bureaucracies and enterprises . . . Such programs lessen beneficiary nations' incentives to radically reform. </PARA>
<PARA>While assistance to the state sector is a highly dubious undertaking, for reasons with which I hope all honourable members are familiar, support of the kind proposed for the emerging private sector in eastern Europe is just as questionable for a variety of reasons. If a majority of the EBRD's operations will be directed towards private market oriented programs, we need to ask why such undertakings cannot simply be left to private foreign venture capital. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can they not be left to private foreign venture capital? Already eastern Europe is experiencing an enormous inflow of Western capital seeking out the opportunities being created by the liberalisation of eastern European economies. There would have been even more such capital available were it not for the enormous sums of money that Western governments paid into international financial institutions such as the World Bank and now the EBRD at the expense of private capital markets. Melanie Tammen also noted:</PARA>
<PARA>The World Bank effects a misallocation of nearly $US12 billion in valuable investment capital annually-soaking it out of international capital markets and funnelling it to state investment schemes throughout the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA>The EBRD should not become a competitor for private capital from the West. The articles of agreement establishing the bank ostensibly recognise this where it is stated that one of its principal methods of operation shall be to `facilitate or enhance the participation of private and/or foreign capital'. Furthermore, article 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bank shall not undertake any financing, or provide any facilities, when the applicant is able to obtain sufficient financing or facilities elsewhere on terms and conditions that the Bank considers reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>These commitments raise other problems, however. First, we must be very suspicious of loans to projects that the private sector will not touch. The criteria the bank will use in making assessments about the availability of alternative finance will of necessity be arbitrary. When the bank talks about facilitating private and foreign capital it is really talking about co-financing and guarantor arrangements for risky projects that would otherwise go unsupported. We know from experience with the World Bank that such projects become driven by the supply of funds and not by market demand. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that to date the massive influx of private and foreign investment that is needed in eastern Europe has not eventuated. We need to look at the reasons for this. First, the eastern European countries continue to maintain significant controls over the movement of foreign capital. Foreign equity is often strictly limited by eastern European governments using discretionary powers under open-ended legislation which is a major deterrent to foreign investment. Some countries prohibit the repatriation of some or all profit. Extensive export and import restrictions are also maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Exchange rate controls and bankrupt non-convertible domestic currencies complicate matters still further. Property rights have yet to be fully defined. Hopefully, most of these controls are on the way out and new laws are to be put in place once they have passed through the new democratic processes. It is only Poland and Hungary that are eagerly embracing market reforms. The rest of eastern Europe is dragging its feet, where it is not actively resisting change. In order to ensure that the most liberal foreign trade and investment regime emerges in eastern Europe, we need to ensure that every incentive is provided to seek out private foreign venture capital. Assistance from Western governments may serve to stave off this liberalisation if it is thought that Western capital can be obtained on easy terms without the necessary legislation taking place to encourage private sector investment from abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the bizarre situation where the regulators in Western countries are themselves inhibiting the free flow of capital to the East. The West German federal cartels office, the German equivalent of our Trade Practices Commission, has sought to block moves by West German companies such as Lufthansa and West German Electricity Utilities to buy a stake in East German counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of support for the private sector, the EBRD is committed to the dubious process of picking winners among eastern European industries and enterprises. Precious little is said in the articles of agreement about the criteria to be used in making such selections but we know from our domestic experience the dangers in this process. In the end, there is no substitute for market imperatives in making these sorts of decisions and the only people who come face to face with these imperatives will be the entrepreneurs on the ground in eastern Europe-not EBRD bureaucrats housed in London, no doubt in the luxurious and removed conditions typical of the World Bank in Washington. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that at the very time that eastern European countries are trying to dispense with the dead hand of the state in their economies, we should be in the business, through the EBRD, of propping up inefficient eastern European industries and enterprises. Western countries should be leading by example, but the sad fact is that we have few lessons to teach. The sort of regulatory and interventionist nonsense that we tolerate in our own countries is only different in degree, not in kind, from that which has enslaved eastern Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that we should export this nonsense to the developing world through the World Bank without again betraying the democratic revolutions in eastern Europe. Ms Tammen says:</PARA>
<PARA>Eastern Europe's recent revolutions were not primarily efforts to obtain democracy-as important as that goal is . . . after more than three decades of state control over nearly every facet of their lives, east Europe's insurgents fought primarily for freedom from the intrusive, stifling, and oppressive hand of government.</PARA>
<PARA>The EBRD has yet to commence operations but already it is embroiled in controversies of the type that have been characteristic of the World Bank and its affiliates. In a report in the Australian Financial Review of 12 October, the President of the bank, Mr Jaques Attali, has been criticised for `imperialistic behaviour bordering on the Napoleonic' in his approach to the bank. </PARA>

A European finance ministry official has claimed that Mr Attali `wants to create a new banking culture, a freewheeling institution with minimum accountability'. Attali himself has pushed for extremely generous salary packages for bank staff while at the same time presiding over an expected $56.9m loss for 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those who follow the activities of the World Bank, these developments will be all too familiar. The Economist on 20 January this year had this to say about the EBRD:</PARA>
<PARA>It is politics that has pushed the 34 countries into creating [the Bank]. In private, many have doubts about whether the Bank is really needed. But no country wants to be seen as holding back help to eastern Europe. Politics will also dominate the Bank's work.</PARA>
<PARA>By all accounts, the United States of America became involved in the bank only because it was going to be established anyway and it does not want to see its already weak private sector orientation further eroded. The arguments that are put forward to justify our subvention to the bank are lame, to say the least. We are told that the bank will give us a voice in the events unfolding in eastern Europe-an extravagant claim if ever there was one. Access to information is another claim put forward, but experience with the World Bank suggests that there will be precious little of that. Inquiries of the Treasury confirm that it is either incapable of supplying or unwilling to supply detailed information about the EBRD. If it is not supplying this information now when we are debating this Bill, how much do honourable members think will be supplied later?</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, Australia's contribution will be a token gesture, and the recipients will be wholly oblivious to our contribution, which amounts to only one per cent of paid-in capital. If we are going to be in the business of bankrolling other countries' development, then such assistance should be supplied on a bilateral basis, and well targeted in areas of direct concern to Australia. Forty-five million dollars would go a long way in the South Pacific region. In the context of the new Europe, it does not even rank as a drop in the bucket. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) recently argued that Australia was a poor country that could not afford greater spending on infrastructure. Of course, the Treasurer would know better than anyone else about our national poverty, since he is the one who is responsible for it. But, if we are a poor country, it seems strange that we can nevertheless afford to underwrite the activities of this new bank. We cannot afford greater infrastructure spending in Australia, but we can, apparently, afford to underwrite such spending in eastern Europe. That the EBRD will probably lend at interest rates considerably lower than those imposed on Australians by this Government is perhaps the greatest insult to taxpayers, who will have to cough up Australia's contribution to this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, our contribution is simply unnecessary. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that it will take 15 years for the east Europeans to build their economies after the devastation wrought by decades of central planning. But, after that, eastern Europe, like West Germany after the war, will have the most modern and efficient economies in the industrialised world, in addition to enjoying the benefits of proximity to, if not inclusion in, the single European market. All the evidence suggests that this will occur despite, rather than because of, assistance from Western governments. Just as the Marshall Plan stood in the way of the recovery of western Europe following the Second World War, the EBRD threatens to stand in the way of the recovery of eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that in 40 years we in the West have learned little that we can teach the newly liberated nations of eastern Europe. One way or another, we might provide the capital, but we cannot supply the capitalists, given the present or likely propensities of most eastern European governments. I conclude by quoting Melanie Tammen of the Cato Institute:</PARA>
<PARA> The message is quite simple: there is no capitalism without capitalists. And capitalists (domestic and foreign) are something the East European nations will have to cultivate on their own-through constitutionally guaranteed and fully functional property rights systems, viable legal accounting systems, modest levels of taxation and regulation, and a functioning convertible currency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the coalition has decided not to oppose the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill 1990, I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) will take note of the remarks that my friend and colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has just made because he has signalled some of the difficulties that may exist for Australia with this Bill. We in the coalition have been seeking to upgrade the level of debate in the House of Representatives-against all efforts by the Government, I might say-and I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will read very carefully the speech of the honourable member for Curtin and acquaint himself with some of the difficulties and some of the matters that my friend has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In assessing whether the coalition should be supporting this Bill, I was fortunate recently to travel to the Soviet Union, to Czechoslovakia and to Hungary, the latter two being two of the countries in the so-called Eastern bloc. The changes taking place in those countries indicate an end to the Cold War of the last 45 years and herald a probable era of peace between the superpowers. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the changes in eastern Europe are not immediately apparent to those who live distant from that part of the world. However, at close hand, it is clear that the Russian Government is completely discredited with its own people. There seem to be three main reasons for this: the loss of the war in Afghanistan; the Chernobyl disaster; and the collapsing economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union lost the war in Afghanistan, not so much to the rebels in that country as to its apparent inability to secure for the citizens of Afghanistan a socialist society consistent with its own. Over a period of years it became clear to the Soviet population that the great socialist crusade, part of the rationale for the sacrifices the Russian people had endured, would not prevail in a country where an intransigent government and active rebels never seemed to be able to come to a sensible accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chernobyl disaster, where the meltdown of a nuclear reactor meant the evacuation of up to a million people from the area, including one city of 250,000 people which is now completely deserted, was a devastating blow against a regime that had relied for its validity on its ability to protect its citizens. The secrecy surrounding this nuclear disaster was also a blow to the Soviet people and a further demonstration that they were not being told the facts on what was going on in their country. News about the nuclear meltdown filtered slowly to the population, was received at first with disbelief, and finally with the resignation that comes when people know they have been grossly deceived. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy of the Soviet Union is collapsing. For these reasons, there are momentous changes taking place in that country which covers one-sixth of the globe's surface and, in my view, those changes are irreversible. Even in the unlikely event that the military takes control, communism has passed into history as yet another manifestation of human folly. Much more likely, after many difficulties, will be the establishment of some form of pluralist society, representative democracy and at least the partial establishment of what we know as market forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of the collapse of the Russian economy abounds. In many parts of the country there is rationing. In Leningrad and Kiev, for example, citizens are restricted to two cakes of soap a week, two pounds of sugar a week and, for buses and trucks, 40 litres of petrol a day. There are queues everywhere indicating the failure of central planning and confirming the shortages that abound in the community. There are queues for shoes, for petrol, for jeans, for cigarettes, and even for chocolate-coated ice cream. </PARA>
<PARA> The shortage of cigarettes arose because there are only two plants in all of Russia that make filters for cigarettes, and one of those broke down. There were almost riots over the cigarette shortages. There were also queues for those things we would consider of Western origin-for McDonald's hamburgers, Estee Lauder cosmetics and, you would be pleased to know Mr Deputy Speaker, the bread products produced by a joint venture with the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy's linchpin of central control has not worked. All Russians now know this and they talk incessantly about the failure of their economic system. The communications network is a shambles, with extraordinary inflexibility and days of waiting to get international phone calls. The currency is in chaos with the exchange rate being four roubles to the Australian dollar on the official market but close to 20 roubles to the Australian dollar on the black market. Some of these countries have not only a black market but also what they call a dark market. There is the tourist rate, the official rate, the black market rate and the dark market rate. I presume that the dark market is one step lower than the black market. </PARA>
<PARA> The future of Russia is bound up with the future of its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. We regard Gorbachev as something of a hero for what he has done in terms of world peace. The recent awarding to him of the Nobel Peace Prize is testament to this. But inside Russia he is widely regarded as yesterday's man who is not moving fast enough to implement the changes necessary to overcome Russia's economic difficulties. For months now he has been seen to be operating a rearguard action against the radicals who would move Russia and its republic to full representative democracy and a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was visiting the Embassy in Moscow I was told that at a recent cocktail party Gorbachev had been speaking to the Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union. He said to the ambassador, `A year ago I was saying to people, ``It's me or chaos''. Today its me and chaos''.' A major task before Gorbachev must be to attempt to keep the Soviet republics together in some form of economic union. The Baltic states are extraordinarily fractious, the Ukraine is becoming restless and the Asian republics in the south are caught up in the winds of change provoked by Muslim fundamentalism. Gorbachev must try to find the mechanism to give the republics sufficient autonomy to placate their independence movements while keeping the country together as an economic unit.</PARA>
<PARA> An intriguing aspect of what the Soviet President has been saying recently is that in his discussions on the behaviour of people and countries, for example the events in the Persian Gulf, he has been talking in a way that we might describe as demonstrating Western values. He may well wish eventually to move his country into the European Economic Community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great social issues emerging in the Soviet Union is the environment. Pollution in Russia is appalling because there has not been, as there is in free societies, an opportunity for interest groups to hold meetings and demonstrations in order to draw the attention of the Government to the degradation of the countryside. The Russians have been pouring effluent into their rivers and lakes for decades. In some industrial cities 90 per cent of the children have skin diseases because of the pollution. The Aral Sea, which used to be the largest internal sea in Europe, has now virtually disappeared partly because of the industrial wastes that have been emptied into it over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> We often discuss in Australia the question of what we call sustainable development, that is, the balance between development and the environment. We sometimes think that we have trouble coming to terms with that balance. A visit to the polluted areas of Russia, or even looking at the murky swamp that used to be called the beautiful Blue Danube, would satisfy our detractors that in our free society we are immeasurably better off in terms of the protection of the environment than are closed societies such as the former communist Russia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important questions that the world now faces is whether Russia can make the necessary social and economic transitions without mass violence. It is now clear to the administrators in that country that appropriate incentives must be established for people to work and to save and to invest. Russia simply cannot continue with the absurd situation where waiters tell you that restaurants are full when they are three-quarters empty because serving more people is harder for them. It is also clear that homes, properties, businesses and vehicles must have their ownership transferred from the state to those who live in, operate and drive them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that there must be a framework for the protection of free speech. Extraordinarily, everyone is now talking about the difficulties in Russia. For example, the Russians call the Aurora, the cruiser in the Neva River in Leningrad that fired the shot that signalled the start of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 when Bolshevik troops attacked the Winter Palace where the interim government was in session, the most expensive cruiser in the world. That is because one blank shot led to 70 years of disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent cartoon in Pravda showed Marx, Engels and Lenin all sitting on a bench looking pensive. Marx is saying, `But it was such a good idea in theory'. Furthermore, acknowledgment of the failure of communism is evidenced by the disappearance of Lenin's statues. Lenin has virtually disappeared from the Baltic and Asian republics. He is going in the Ukraine. Even in Russia itself the signs are there, with the city of Leningrad likely to revert to its original name of St Petersburg. </PARA>
<PARA> What do all these changes inside the Soviet Union mean for Australia? We are well regarded in Russia but the enormous changes taking place there really rule us out of the main game. In the short term we may well be worse off as the Soviet Union spends some years looking inwards, not outwards, and the economic difficulties there mean we will sell less to the Soviet Union and so exacerbate our own balance of payments difficulties. But to every cloud there is a silver lining. Despite the fact that our economic difficulties in Australia may be marginally worse as a result of the demise of communism, the good news is that the Cold War is over, the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers is greatly diminished and our children can look forward to peace in their generation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also massive changes taking place in what we know as the Eastern bloc countries, namely, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Poland is well advanced towards becoming a pluralist society, with free elections for their President about to take place, while East Germany has now been absorbed into the greater Germany that forms part of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> Czechoslovakia and Hungary are both embracing parliamentary democracy and market economies and enshrining a framework of free speech and freedom of worship. They are also working hard to normalise their relations with Russia, particularly in such areas as troop withdrawal, reparation and, most important economically, currency convertibility. However, both countries face substantial difficulties in the transition now taking place. One of the most serious problems is that there is simply no government infrastructure that can provide a rock of stability for the changes. Furthermore, difficulties with the police-who acted as informants in the previous regimes-pollution, unemployment, inflation, minorities and corruption will be difficult to overcome. Bottlenecks in the food supply pipeline mean that many people work for only four hours a day and spend the remainder of the working day hunting for food. If these countries are to survive, incentive frameworks must be established to overcome these economic and social problems. Most important is the abolition of government monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we may all be surprised at the rate at which the changes take place and the speed at which Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary join the European Community as part of what we would regard as the Western group of nations. We may also be surprised at the way in which these small countries adjust to having a united Germany and the Soviet Union as their powerful, near and strong neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, with our substantial continental migrant population, is taking a keen interest in these fascinating developments in eastern Europe. In the medium term, a strong and united Europe, at peace with itself and comfortable with its boundaries, looking outward to the world and committed to international free trade, may well provide a market for Australia that will enhance our economic development and also provide a massive bulwark against threats to the free societies of our Western democracies. For all these reasons, and having seen what I saw in the Eastern bloc countries and the Soviet Union, I support this Bill for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill, but after hearing the contribution of one Opposition member I want to make a few comments, which I will try to keep as brief as possible. First of all, I acknowledge that the Opposition will not be opposing this legislation, but I am a little disappointed in some of the comments which have been made this afternoon. I hope I misunderstood them and that the Opposition is more supportive of this legislation than some of the comments of Opposition members suggest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition seems to be concerned that this proposal may not provide as much assistance to the countries of eastern Europe as the proposal for the setting up of the bank suggests. I am a little concerned that some of the comments of the Opposition might be interpreted as suggesting that Australia might be making a mistake by putting money into this proposal. Therefore, I make a few short comments. When we are considering this legislation, the real question we, as members of the Australian Parliament, have to ask is: how much is democracy worth to us as Australians? How much should we be kicking in to try to help democracy flourish in eastern Europe?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) very eloquently explained what he has seen in the Soviet Union-the environmental disasters, the queues which people have to endure and the economic disaster which is the Soviet Union, not to mention, of course, the terror which existed in that country for 70 years; the ruthlessness that was applied to people, whether of the Right or democratic Left, who opposed the communist party and who were liquidated simply because they disagreed with the group in control. In relation to the changes which will hopefully continue in the Soviet Union, and the great revolution which has already taken place in eastern Europe, I think we should be rejoicing and trying to make sure that we do everything we can to ensure that the very fragile democracies which have already sprouted in eastern Europe grow and are nurtured. </PARA>
<PARA> The European Commission has come up with the great idea that other developed countries can help these countries adopt market mechanisms and better industry. As an Australian, I think that is terrific, because it means that those fragile democracies in eastern Europe have a chance of surviving. We should not doubt the fact that there is no guarantee that democracy will survive in eastern Europe. The economies of these countries are under great pressure at the moment, especially from the increase in oil prices. We all know that the Soviet Union has told the eastern European countries that, in future, they will have to pay for Russian oil in hard currency. That is causing massive turmoil for those countries in eastern Europe. It is very hard to see how they can afford to pay for both Russian oil and oil from other sources in hard currency and still afford to purchase the manufacturing equipment they need to try to get their economies off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have substantial Czechoslovakian and Polish communities as well as communities from all these other eastern European countries. People in those communities made the decision after the Second World War to come to Australia. Even if this Parliament is acting only on behalf of those Australians whose origins are in eastern Europe, then I think it is a small repayment that our country can make to the eastern European peoples who have given Australia so much in the years since the War. So I, as a member of this Parliament, am more than happy to put my hand up for $9m a year for five years to be put into something which I hope and pray will assist these countries in eastern Europe. </PARA>

<PARA> I had the benefit, honour and privilege of visiting several towns in East Germany as well as Prague in Czechoslovakia. Many of the industries in eastern Europe are uneconomic and it is very hard to see many of the factories surviving. On a more light-hearted note, I was told that one factory which used to produce tanks has now been converted into a factory that produces babies' prams, but the problem is that the prams are produced for the same price as the tanks used to be produced. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that it is not quite that bad, but there are great problems with manufacturing industries set up under the Stalinist planning schemes. A lot of money was put into their manufacturing and heavy industry, and these countries now have outdated capital plant, inefficient work practices and bottlenecks in the production and use of goods. They need help, and this legislation will allow Australia and other countries in the world to try to make sure that they can get the finance they need, probably to buy Western manufacturing equipment, which we hope will go towards improving their economies and that, as a direct result, the people of eastern Europe will get some basic improvements in their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the West, we in the democratic countries of the world, should be concerned as to what is going to happen to the democracies of eastern Europe when the tough economic decisions are taken, when unemployment in what was East Germany reaches 50 per cent, as has been predicted by the economists. There is a real danger that the people of eastern Europe, when they go through a great deal of pain and a reduction in their living standards, might equate that with a democratic government and come to the conclusion that democracy means that economically they are worse off because of the pain they will go through in the next few years. So I think that, even for selfish reasons, we in the democratic West should be trying to make sure that the democratic governments of those countries are vibrant and survive. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand there was a recent demonstration in one or two cities in Germany by people associated with the extreme Right in German politics. People were greatly surprised by the large numbers of people who marched in those demonstrations organised by the extreme Right. I suppose in the shadows they are the groups that we are all concerned about; that people close to the neo-fascist forces that still exist in eastern Europe might gain in strength as these tough economic decisions bite. We are saying that people should be allowed free speech and should have the right to express their views. So I do not say that if people hold a view that is on the extreme Right they should not have the right to speak and march and do all the things that fascists in Australia can do-or communists, for that matter. All we are saying is that we believe that if we invest money in the economies of those countries there is less chance of groups such as that increasing the support they might get at democratic elections in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> When I visited the Australian Embassy in Prague, I was pleasantly surprised to see that some Australian organisations were already looking for commercial opportunities.

I certainly wish that company every success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I want to mention two things about the Soviet Union. The first is that I am not yet convinced that the Soviet Union is committed to the changes which need to take place in that country. So I am pleased to see that this proposal does not provide for any of this assistance to be given to the Soviet Union for at least the first three years. If in three years time the Soviet Union has not progressed sufficiently, I personally believe that we should try to keep the funds to the other democratic countries in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three other countries which I think should be included in this proposal, and it is probably time now to include them. They are the three Baltic countries, which some people would say are now part of the Soviet Union. I believe that the three Baltic countries have been entitled to their independence ever since the 1940s, when Hitler and Stalin agreed to the Soviet Union's swallowing up those three countries illegally, and that because that was done illegally under international law, we should not accept that the three Baltic countries are no longer countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The parliaments of those three countries have taken brave steps to try to demonstrate their independence. They are after assistance from international bodies such as the EBRD, and I believe it is time for us to face up to the fact that those three Baltic countries have the right to their independence and that schemes such as this should include them. As one Australian who believes it is very important for the democratic forces of the West that democracy thrive and be seen to be not only economically successful but also a success in terms of the rights of the people of eastern Europe, I wish those three Baltic countries and all other countries of eastern Europe all the best.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A year or so ago when the Warsaw Pact countries decided that they would change their direction, I think all the Western world welcomed it. We here in Australia were certainly pleased to see that because, as one of the earlier speakers mentioned, the Cold War virtually was ceasing and certainly it was in the interests of peace throughout the world. But I suppose that at that time our minds flickered on what would be the outcome as the months and the years went on as to the direction that the Western world would take to try to assist these countries back onto a proper economic footing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are all aware, of course, of the work of the World Bank and its responsibilities. At the time I thought maybe it was the organisation to take over the rehabilitation of and the provision of assistance to those eight Warsaw Pact countries. However, the European Community (EC) came up with the idea that there should be this new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and it is this legislation that we are now debating in the Parliament. I am pleased to see the legislation, and I must join with the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) because I think that Australia has a great responsibility as a country growing in world importance to be interested in matters of world affairs. I speak particularly of the countries that we are trading with from day to day and to which we are looking for opportunities to actually enlarge our trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been to Russia and I suppose that, like the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), I can say certain things about that country, but maybe one can sum it up by saying the very simple thing that I was impressed by the will of the people. I was impressed that here is a nation which throughout the centuries, since the days of Napoleon, has been attacked at least five times. Russia has had its present type of regime for 70 years now, and it is rather interesting that even the riches of the Czars have been restored. Besides the tombs, one will find the winter palaces, the summer palaces, the art works that the Nazis did not take during the Second World War, and the ones they did take that were retrieved by the Russians. All have been preserved for the future of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The Russian people have a great personal resource behind them. In fact, I would even say that it would not hurt Australia if we were to let some Russians emigrate here because it is a country that, like the other seven we are talking about, now wants to get out of the grasp of communism, socialism, and to take the opportunity to expand and to allow the individual to take an interest in his or her country. They may do something that Australia really needs at the present time-that is, make a citizens' attempt, a combined people's attempt, to get their country back on a proper economic footing. I believe that one of the problems today in Australia is that we are not as people, as Australians, from a nationalistic point of view, attacking the problem of getting our country back onto a footing on which we would like to see it. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of the Warsaw Pact countries will have a new world actually before them, and we cannot blame them if they want to improve themselves. We have a responsibility to do what we can to assist them. Russia, I know, as the honourable member for Dobell says, will be restricted because it will be able to borrow only the money that it has been able to put into the fund. I suppose that is quite fair; the United States of America is one country which asked for that and it was actually agreed upon. Our share of the fund will be very small-approximately one per cent, or around $A45m. </PARA>
<PARA> We can afford that in order to assist peace throughout the world, to get our fellow men back onto a reasonable footing. We give a lot of foreign aid in different forms-I think $700m to $800m a year. This is a practical way of giving foreign aid to countries that want to adjust, and perhaps over the years to come it will give us an opportunity to trade and deal with them commercially on different bases. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation. I think it is a wonderful opportunity for us to share with the Warsaw Pact countries the progress of the countries of the Western world who want to help them improve. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, of course, is an oil and gas producer. At the moment it is very fortunate because of the situation in the Gulf. Every dollar by which a barrel of oil goes up is worth about $600m to the Russians. This is another issue that will assist to put them back on their feet. They are a resilient people. The population of approximately 300 million is decentralised across the largest continent on earth. They have land, they have natural resources, and they will be able to prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the practical side. What the Government and the Opposition are concerned about is that the Australian people are depending upon us to open the gates of trade so as to benefit these people generally and to benefit Australians economically. This is the only sensible and logical approach we can take. We are faced at the present time with a crisis in wool and a crisis in grain. We are producing many other commodities and there are opportunities there for us to sell. These countries buy a lot of beef from us, and the opportunity is there to expand in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think 60 per cent of the finance we are providing to these eight European countries is to go into private enterprise; 40 per cent may be spent on government utilities but it cannot be used for raising the economy directly through measures adopted by any of these countries. I think the percentages I quote and my assessments are correct. </PARA>
<PARA> As people of this world we ought to say, particularly to President Bush, to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to President Mitterrand and to Chancellor Kohl of Germany, `Thank God we have leaders of the Western world who have vision and who take responsibility for doing the proper thing'. As Australians we are dependent on those countries to do the proper thing, and those countries form the foundation generally for the legislation we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA> We want the trade. The other day a deputation from the Cattlemen's Union came to see me. A month ago the union spoke in Sydney with someone from the Russian Embassy about the way Australia could supply wool and grain and other commodities to the Russians on a terms basis. I point out to the House that for many years India and the Soviet Union have been going back to the barter system. It is a funny thing that history repeats itself. In those early days when there were no coins, no dollar notes, no pound notes, people used to barter with their neighbours. The Aborigines in Australia bartered for things. In principle, we are going back to bartering, and it is not a bad way to do things. I think we term it countertrade. India and the Soviet Union have what they term a rupee-rouble system which has proved very beneficial for those two countries. They trade with each other in certain goods. </PARA>
<PARA> This is something we have to look at in Australia. I do not know who will carry the money, but we do have Austrade. I do not think that generally Austrade has fulfilled its proper role. I do not want to be critical of our manufacturing and scientific research, although it would be easy to do because I believe we are falling behind the rest of the world. We have to work out a way whereby we can either barter with the European countries or carry terms for the commodities we are going to sell to them. I trust the Wool Corporation, the Wheat Board and private firms are looking at ways in which we can do this. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, there will be a tremendous benefit to the Australian banks and financial institutions should they be involved in the European scene. It will be important for them to have their fingers on the pulse so that they know what is happening with the dumping and the subsidising of these other commodities by the European Community. It is very important that Australia should know what is occurring, watching the interests of Australian producers and manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Bruce mentioned that as these countries come back into the European scene they may want to join the EC. That is a logical thing. Even Norway, Sweden and Finland, who I think are not members at the moment, may wish to join. We are looking there at a trading bloc of countries that can trade between themselves and which may be a threat to Australia. I do not think they will be. If we are business-minded and if we accept the challenge of world trade, which we have to do to maintain the standards of our people, then we have to know what might occur. We have to have a finger in the pie. Through this legislation we are doing that in many ways, and I am pleased to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like my friend and colleague the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I was not going to speak in this debate but there is one issue which has not been touched. I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) and the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) speaking of their interesting trips, which have been of value to the House. With some experience of the Asian Development Bank and, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, having some experience with banking in this country over a very long time, there are some things I would like to mention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, I support the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill. Although the debate has ranged widely, I do not plan to speak on my travels. Vietnam hardly comes into the range of a European reconstruction and development Bill. This new European finance organisation is presenting to the world a golden opportunity. Having had a long experience with the Asian Development Bank when I was out of this place, I would counsel the Government. I understand that we are contributing a very small percentage of the capital involved and therefore will have a very small influence, but when our representation is set up I sincerely hope examples will be taken from the Asian Development Bank, which has done a reasonably good job over the years. In the early days I thought it did a great job. I think one has to look at how these international banks, cooperatively created by free nations, are administered. The great thing about the Asian Development Bank is not so much what it is there to do; the great thing is to see who is appointed to executive positions within the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that the effects of that bank have been guided very strongly indeed by two of the major Asian players, namely, Japan and, surprisingly, India. I will not go further into it, because this is not the time to have a slash at the Asian Development Bank and its staffing policy. But I would counsel the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is carrying this Bill, to take heed-I see officers in the House and I hope they will take heed as well-to see that Australia's representative staff who go to this organisation are well placed, having first seen that we have Australians on staff with this organisation. We must not take just any job offered us. I believe that the success for Australia depends strongly on who goes there and who carries it for us. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that is perhaps being overlooked by some is that, although it is a golden opportunity to see what, if any, credits we can supply to Australian exporters, particularly to eastern European markets, this is not what this bank is there for. This bank is not there to help Australian exporters; it has been created to help the east European countries. We have to see that our credit agencies, whether Austrade or others-and a number were brought in by both the former Liberal-National Party Government and the present Labor Government-and that we as a parliament are made to understand what role our staff who go to this bank will be playing and what influence they will be having on the decisions being made. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems when we get into international finance is that it is not as simple as people like to make it out to be. It is complex. The role of Germany-not East or West Germany-in any bank of this nature must never be underestimated. During the recess I went to London. A lot of the people in the city are very concerned-deeply concerned. We even had a senior Minister in the Thatcher Government resigning because of his views on this very question of the influence of Germany on international finance in what we now call the new Europe. I have said enough. I just wanted to make this point come forward in the debate because, although I did not hear the whole debate, I heard most of it and this issue was not brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I am prepared to talk to people privately about what I saw at the Asian Development Bank, but I think it has to be worked through thoroughly when working out the details of our involvement-not our contribution, because that will be worked out internationally and we will have to go along with the game that has been established-with regard to the staff who are going to go over there. It is to be hoped that, even though we are a small contributor, we will have some of our very fine public servants going over there to take a part in this exciting new enterprise. But let us not fool ourselves. It is not going to help our exports. This is not what this financial institution is being established for. This bank is being established to assist the new Europe. I think we will do wrong if we believe that this is going to be an answer to some of our exporting problems at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other speakers who have spoken on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Bill, I want to take the opportunity of adding another dimension to the debate by speaking about what has been happening in recent months in Europe and in the Soviet Union. I was a member of the delegation that has just returned, after two or three weeks, from the Soviet Union and Mongolia. I had the privilege of being in the Soviet Parliament and talking to many members of that Parliament, some in senior positions, and to the people. It was very interesting and I think that their position needs to be stated to give emphasis to and confidence in the movement that this Parliament has now made with regard to providing funding for the new era that is beginning in the Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the remarks that have been made in the past by members on both sides, but I just add that I made a special effort to visit and talk with people in the Parliament and in the churches with regard to the new degree of spirituality that was being developed in the country. One of the things that was openly talked about by the Soviet members was the fact that the 70-odd years of Marxism has destroyed the spirituality of the people. One particular senior Soviet politician, Dr Solovev, said that, having responsibility in that area, he was determined to make sure that everything was done to restore the spirituality of the people and the capacity to revive religion. </PARA>
<PARA> It was indeed pleasing to go throughout the Soviet Union and see that many churches were open. In Russia, for example, we visited one church in Gorky Park and it was almost impossible to get in there on a Saturday afternoon as the churches were packed to the doors with people wanting to return to some of the greater values that were theirs and that they had been able to maintain in an underground way during those 70 years when religion was suppressed as a result of the very strong and supervised aspect of Marxism, which was atheistic. For example, at 7 o'clock at night, when one would normally expect to see the news, the most popular program on Soviet television came on. It was stories from the `super book' and all the people, the families, gathered together. The members of parliament were discussing it and telling me quite openly that it was the most popular program in their households. Of course, they were referring to stories from the Bible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is actively encouraging organisations like the Bible Society and the Gideons and a club which is not religiously oriented to a great extent, the Rotary Club. It is permitting four Rotary Clubs in the Soviet Union. The Gideons, for example, have been encouraged to visit the University of Moscow and make sure that every student has the opportunity to receive a copy of the Bible. Every one of the 10,000 military police in Moscow has been issued with a copy of the word of God. When the Soviet generals met in the Parliament just before we arrived, they asked that they be presented with a copy of the word of God and 31 of the senior Soviet generals were presented, by request, with a copy of the Bible. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that, whilst we are all very encouraged by this legislation and we are all supporting it, we ought to take more courage from the fact that there is indeed a very serious change in the heart of the Soviet Parliament with regard to this very important part of restoring the spirituality of the people. I just mention as I speak in support of the Bill before the Parliament that we ought to take courage from the information that I have been able to pass on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House has before it the Australian National Maritime Museum Amendment Bill 1990 which is, of course, the Bill which establishes the Australian National Maritime Museum as an independent statutory authority. In that intent, the Bill is in no way contentious because the establishment of the Museum is a matter which has always enjoyed bipartisan support, and that support has been I think a matter of public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that anyone could dispute that maritime activity has had enormous significance in the history of this country. It goes back, I suppose, to the Macassar incursions on our north coast. But, of course, for the nation of Australia-a nation which grew from British possession and settlement-the early contact had with this country by mariners was at the core of our foundation. As an island country we have not only an historical but an ongoing relationship with sea transport, and to have a museum which, as the second reading speech observes, reflects the significance of maritime activity in the history and cultural life of Australians is important. In that sense, I am very pleased on behalf of the Opposition to give my support to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is one which had a number of technical defects. It has been around for a long time and indeed, I guess, the period in which this legislation has been around represents just a small part of the overall mismanagement of this project by the Government. But at least the fact that the legislation has been around for some time meant that a number of technical defects could be identified by the Opposition and drawn to the attention of the Government-and I am pleased that, when the Bill was considered in the Senate, the Government moved a number of amendments which reflected the amendments which had been suggested by the Opposition. To that extent, therefore, the Bill in the form in which it is before this House is, in our view, even more satisfactory than the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Opposition shadow Ministers have been involved at different stages of the consideration of the Museum, and I would like to mention a number of them. The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), when he was our spokesman on the arts, was very concerned with the policy decisions which had to be taken with respect to the establishment of the Museum and our support for it, and the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) also took a very active interest; but I particularly acknowledge the efforts of former Senator Chris Puplick who successfully promoted amendments to the Government and, in line with his passionate concern for the arts and culture in this country, took the most active possible interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We do however feel that, even at the technical level, the Bill still has some defects. I will, at a later stage in the committee consideration of the Bill, move some amendments which go to the exclusion from the Council of people over the age of 65. I am sorry that the Government has not seen fit to accept our amendment proposals in that regard because it is the view of the Opposition that, in this day and age, it is totally unsuitable that we should disqualify people from participation in activities such as this-indeed, any of the productive activities within the community-on the grounds of age alone. In this area in particular, people of mature years who have had a lifetime's experience in maritime industry may have a particularly valuable role to play-and I would hope that even at this late stage the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is seated at the table, might reconsider what is, I think, a very poorly based objection to the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that, as we can debate in the committee stage, in a number of similar bodies there is no age restriction-and the Government excuse for not accepting these further amendments was along the lines that they wanted some sort of overall approach and were considering this so that all these matters could be dealt with together. But, in our view, there is no excuse for putting such a discriminatory provision into the law. I would hope that, in the time that is available between now and the committee stage, the Minister might reconsider that matter on behalf of the Government of which he is part. I think it is a matter of regret that the Government and the Australian Democrats combined in the Senate to defeat this attempt to ensure both justice and effective use of available talent. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Mr Deputy Speaker, the support of the Opposition for this legislation is clear. We would like to see it further improved, but we thoroughly support what is being put forward. We regard the Museum as an important addition to the preservation of an important part of our history as well as a means of educating all of us so that we have a better understanding of our own country.</PARA>
<PARA> We also acknowledge the contribution of the United States of America-a contribution which was fostered by the former Ambassador from that country, Mr Bill Lane, who I think is well known to most honourable members of this House. He was assiduous in his promotion of good relations between the United States and Australia, generous in his approach to his duties, and generous in his approach to this country; and a very significant contribution was made as a bicentennial gift to this Museum by the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps worth mentioning in passing that one of the regrets we have about the way that this whole thing was handled is that a building which was supposed to be completed and opened in 1988 as part of our Bicentenary was in fact opened only a few months ago-and I think that in the United States, as in United Kingdom and New Zealand, which also made generous contributions to this institution, there was a little concern about where the whole thing was going. But I believe that all of those donor countries, and indeed the people of Australia, can be confident that this institution will be able to ensure that both the bicentennial gifts which were so generously made by other countries and the items which are to be purchased by taxpayers or which are already owned by the Museum are preserved and used for the permanent benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government's second reading speech in this place adequately sets out the framework which has been provided, and I do not need to deal with that here. What, rather unsurprisingly, is not dealt with in the Government's contribution to this debate is the sorry history of the handling by the Australian Labor Party (ALP) of this national project, which has cost New South Wales taxpayers about a $40m contribution to what is a Commonwealth project. I want to mention this aspect because, in a way, I think the whole way this project was handled is a parable of what is wrong with Australia-and it is a parable about the contribution which has been made by the right wing of the New South Wales Labor Party to the very significant difficulties which we now face. I will explain that during the course of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be fair to say that in no other country of the world would a significant national institution be dealt with in the haphazard and politically self-serving way that this has been dealt with. Sadly, I do not think that is particularly unusual as part of this 1980s decade of Labor. In no other country of the world which claims to be part of the liberal democratic tradition would one find, of course, the equivalent of WA Inc.-the behaviour of government which goes to sectional, rather than public, interest. WA Inc. sums up conduct which is different from the conduct of Labor governments over this Museum. In WA Inc. and its various manifestations in the State that we share, Western Australia, I think that the overwhelming and unhappy fact is that public funds have been diverted to private purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say that I was delighted to read in the West Australian within the last day the statement that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, thought that a full inquiry was needed. I share that view and congratulate you on adding your voice to the consistent voice of the Liberal Party of Australia in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The WA Inc. deals do share one thing in common with the history of this Museum. Those deals also involve buying off political problems with the use of public funds. The bail out of Rothwells Ltd by Burke, the Petrochemical Industry Co. Ltd deal by Dowding, the cover-up by Premier Lawrence are all typical of the new look of Labor fathered by Neville Wran and the New South Wales Right. It is no secret that Neville Wran set the new pattern from 1976 on, but I suspect that he would be ashamed of what his imitators made of his approach. Certainly, from my personal dealings with Premier Wran I would say that that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> In ALP thinking it has been established that public money can be used for the direct political benefit of the ALP. What has also been established is the principle that one captures institutions of authority and influence in the community, be it the Public Service, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or the legal profession. Indeed, as a relative newcomer to this House, I might say that my brief experience here suggests to me that the same attitude is brought to bear on the conduct of proceedings in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> This Museum had a respectable conception. It was recommended by the Pigott Committee of Inquiry into Museums and National Collections in 1975. However, the birth was enmeshed in politics. In March 1984, the then Premier Wran and the then Commonwealth Minister, Mr Cohen, announced plans for a national maritime museum to be built by the Commonwealth on land provided by the State at Darling Harbour. This announcement was related to the election of that year. The $30m figure was based on broad plans. The final Commonwealth approval was announced in June 1985 under the supervision of an advisory committee which became an interim council in December 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The design brief was settled in February 1986 and the contract was awarded to the distinguished Sydney architect, Mr Philip Cox. The proposal was for completion in time for the Bicentenary in 1988. In March 1988, two luminaries of the New South Wales Right, Mr Barry Cohen, as the responsible Commonwealth Minister, and the then relevant State Minister, Mr Laurie Brereton, who is now a member of this chamber and who will be speaking in this debate, signed a memorandum of understanding governing the establishment of the Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that I have made criticisms, can I say that I do not think any criticism that I am going to utter tonight would be as severe as the criticism or the comments which have been made widely in the public media over this matter. For example, the following was said in the Sydney Morning Herald in October 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National Maritime Museum is a creature of politics. It was created as an election ploy and was from the outset manipulated to further political ends. </PARA>
<PARA> The essentially politically function of the maritime museum is reflected in the appointment of Mr Sergi, a former diplomat and private secretary to the Minister for the Arts, as acting director. Like many of those recruited to Foreign Affairs, his interests range widely. Former colleagues recall that he would relieve the tedium of Canberra by reading Homer-in classical Greek. A man with a dry wit, Mr Sergi readily concedes that political factors played a key role in the decision to establish the museum. </PARA>
<PARA> ``It was a will of the Government'', he said. ``Someone said to me, ``Give me a maritime museum'', and I said, ``Yes, sir'' and here it is''. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that one only has to examine the agreement which was signed by the honourable member who will be speaker later in this debate and the implications of that agreement for the State of New South Wales to see that it properly attracts very harsh criticism. In that agreement, we find a proposal for this Museum which provided for its construction by the new Darling Harbour Authority, which was to build it on behalf of the Commonwealth. The proposal would, in the words of the agreement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . bring or cause the buildings and associated works to be brought to a stage of completion that will enable the Museum to commence operations on or about 31 March 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>The agreement provided that the Authority would confirm that the works as depicted in the sketch plans and supporting documents and as approved by the Commonwealth can be completed within an outturn cost to the Commonwealth of $30m inclusive of fees and within the Authority's program to the achieve the agreed completion date of on or about 31 March 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very interesting agreement and I do not think that anyone reading it in full could doubt that what was broadly being publicly put forward was a proposal for a Commonwealth building for Commonwealth purposes on State-provided land. No doubt the interest of the State was to have the institution in Sydney, which seems to me to be quite an appropriate place for it, but it was envisaged that this would be done and the cost met by the Commonwealth, although the agreement specifically provided that work in excess of $30m would be paid by the State. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, what we have is a bit of a joke. This is not much of a joke for the people of New South Wales because the final cost is something in the order of $70m. As I said in opening my speech, after a rather bitter exchange between the now Liberal Government of New South Wales with its relevant Minister, Mr David Hay, and Commonwealth Ministers earlier this year, there has been an acceptance of the fact that this deal between Mr Cohen and Mr Brereton has left the State with the payment of the greater part of the cost of this Commonwealth facility. This seems to me to be a quite extraordinary confidence trick to have pulled on taxpayers of New South Wales. I have already observed the context in which that happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of what the effect of this was and what the Ministers' actions involved as far as those taxpayers are concerned, one can only turn to another authority from the New South Wales Right-that is, the then responsible Minister, Senator Richardson. In response to a question from Senator Puplick, he confirmed that this agreement provided a blank cheque. Let me quote Senator Puplick exactly. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as a result of a memorandum . . . the Government of New South Wales is absolutely liable for all construction costs in excess of $30m. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson confirmed that in very strong and clear terms. Senator Puplick then went on to ask him the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Is the Minister saying that the memorandum of understanding signed by Ministers Cohen and Brereton, other than the way in which it relates to additional costs arising from changes in the design-which were initiated by the Commonwealth-effectively amounts to a blank cheque making New South Wales responsible for all expenditure on the construction of this museum over and above $30m. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson's reply was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes, that is correct. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of his statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I understand why the State would attempt to change that, given that it does not like to pay the bill; but pay the bill it shall. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I could trail through various newspaper comments that have been made, all commenting on the extraordinary history and administration of this project. But the simple point I want to make in this debate is that this was a good objective done in a way which involved enormous expense to the people of New South Wales, and done in that way for no reason other than that it suited the electoral needs of the Australian  Labor Party. In that sense I think the description of it by the State Minister as a rip-off of New South Wales is an eminently fair and reasonable one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister did. I just want to say something else since the Minister at the table has something to say about this. There is another way in which this project illustrates the sad condition that we have been brought to in this country, and illustrates it much more than the debate we hear from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) day by day, the irrelevant nonsense that he goes on with in this place. If one goes back and looks at the whole question of the construction of Darling Harbour, the bankrupting of various subcontractors, the behaviour of the trade unions involved and the cost of what was done, one sees a splendid example of why this country has been impoverished in the way that it has been during the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just want to express my deepest regret that in this project, which every Australian would support, we have had these manifestations of the low standard of politics which have been brought to this country by the ALP over recent years; the putting of the ALP interest before the national and taxpayer interests; and the toleration of behaviour in the building industry and elsewhere with respect to the trade union movement which I do not think should be tolerable in any free and decent society. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter that I want to mention and I do not want to go into it in great detail. It goes to the treatment of the three members of the Council who were unceremoniously dumped by the Government a couple of years ago. I simply wish to say that I have seen no public or private explanation of that and I wish to express my regret that in this case people of high reputation, who were performing a public service, were treated in the shabby way that they were. That is another aspect of this which makes me most unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other thing that I want to mention is that the issue has been raised about the involvement in this of people with Labor Party connections. I have mentioned Mr Sergi; I do not intend to mention anybody else because the advice I have had from my colleagues in New South Wales is that the people who were appointed to the Council were all people whose personal qualities are without question and who had, in a personal sense, the capacity to contribute to this project. I therefore have no wish to cause unhappiness to anybody here in this chamber or outside this chamber. Those people appointed to the Council are of good repute and, as I have said, all my advice is that they are worthy appointees. </PARA>
<PARA> But to those members of this House who think this is a pretty funny way to debate a museum, I simply wish to say that I think this country is in far more trouble than the usual debate that we hear in this place seems to admit. It is pretty important, as we analyse the actions of this Government, that we try to focus on those acts and the quality of those acts which have brought us to the unhappy situation that we are in today. I suggest that a proper examination of the way in which this Museum was established demonstrates quite clearly why history will judge this Labor Party period of Australia's history very harshly indeed-as a shabby, short-sighted, self-interested abuse of taxpayers and the translation of worthy purposes to most unworthy ends. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry that the starting of the Maritime Museum has been sullied by the Labor Party's action and I can only say that I hope that the people who will now have the responsibility of ensuring that it makes its contribution to Australia are in no way held back by the faults and failures of their previous political masters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that, when the concept of the National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour was first discussed between the then Commonwealth Government and the State Government of which I was a member, the last thing I expected was that I would be a member of this chamber when the legislation establishing the Australian National Maritime Museum passed through the House. But I am delighted that things have turned out this way and that I have the opportunity tonight to congratulate the Hawke Government for its sponsorship of the Australian National Maritime Museum at Darling Harbour. I am particularly pleased to be able to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for his personal support because I know full well that, without that very real support and commitment, the Museum would certainly not have proceeded to its present stage and would not now be on the eve of completion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that in 1984, when Darling Harbour was nothing more than a barren wasteland, a run-down collection of disused wharves and railway yards, it was really very difficult to find anyone who wanted to invest in what has now become, of course, the greatest tourist attraction in Australia; then it was an absolute nothing. Back in 1984 we spoke about creating a people place-not a political monument, but a people place-to enrich Sydney, to give it the facilities that it did not have to provide people with an opportunity to enjoy their city. When we spoke about the need to create a great convention centre at Darling Harbour because Sydney did not have a convention centre, when we spoke about the need to create an exhibition centre, the largest exhibition centre in Australia, because Sydney did not have a real exhibition centre other than the run-down facilities at the Sydney showground, when we spoke about establishing the magnificent Powerhouse Museum, the foremost museum of applied arts and sciences in Australia, and when we spoke about creating 200 shops and restaurants, boulevards, parks and landscaped areas, we were not exactly mobbed by supporters; we were not overrun by a rush of visionaries who thought it was a terrific idea. </PARA>
<PARA> On the contrary, it seemed that every knocker under the sun came out of the woodwork and out of the closet to badmouth the project, to denigrate the concept and to say that it was impractical and that it should not happen or would not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were speaking about creating a people place that would enjoy 12 million visitations from international tourists and Australian people enjoying themselves and relaxing, all we heard from the then Opposition in New South Wales were chants of derision. It seemed at the time that political commentators and business investors alike were all filled with a great scepticism about the then New South Wales Government's stated aim of redeveloping that 100 acres of wasteland that was the western doorstep of the central business district of Sydney and to do so with the concept coming to fruition in the bicentennial year, using the Bicentenary and the bicentennial celebrations as the raison d'etre, as it were, for this project. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recall the first meeting with business leaders in Sydney when we floated the plan to create Darling Harbour and outlined the various elements that it was proposed would be involved. A couple of hundred people were present; they were the captains of industry in Sydney. Everyone thought it was a terrific idea but one and all thought it was an impossible dream and they said that really they thought it would prove to be extraordinarily difficult and probably would not come to fruition and that at any rate it was too bathed in uncertainty for them to recommend to their shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against that background, against that sort of scepticism, that the Federal Labor Government agreed to provide funds for the National Maritime Museum. That commitment, as we know, took the form of some $30m in capital contribution and also included the fit-out costs for the Museum, the recurrent costs for the maintenance of the Museum and all the Museum's salaries on an ongoing basis. It was a commitment running into many millions of dollars to make this project a reality. In doing this, the Federal Government acted decisively. It did so to ensure that the Museum went ahead and that the opportunity would be created for some tens of millions of Australians to learn about, enjoy and experience Australia's national maritime heritage. The Government did so against a difficult background because the project had to overcome a good deal of resistance from the Federal bureaucracy, it had to overcome resistance from the people who thought all national museums should be located in Canberra and it had to triumph in the face of competing claims for funding from the Museum of Australia project. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, of course, the National Maritime Museum is very close to completion. It stands as the only museum of its kind that receives Federal funding. It is a magnificent and ideally situated facility. It is located, as we know, adjacent to the working seaport of Sydney. No site could be more appropriate for the establishment of such a museum. The only regret I have, the only negative I have, is one that I share with the Opposition member who spoke earlier tonight, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney): the protracted delay in the completion of the Museum. I will say something about that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I would like to say that the Museum not only will display its own extensive collection but also will be home to the visiting tall ships that come to Sydney on a regular basis. The ambience of the Museum needs to be experienced to be believed. The Museum is surrounded by the working seaport with the ships berthed at the wharves, the clanking of chains, the beat of the tugs working in the area. It is an ideal location. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the election of the Greiner Government in New South Wales in March 1988, the Museum has been the subject of a concerted series of attacks by the coalition in New South Wales. Those attacks have continued and have been reflected in the debate on this legislation, both in the Senate and here in the House tonight. I would like to take the opportunity to reply to some of those attacks. Firstly, let me say that the honourable member for Pearce has indicated that any proper examination of the National Maritime Museum would show all sorts of weaknesses. The honourable member obviously did not make a proper examination of the legislation; if he had, he would realise exactly where the cost overruns occurred and who was responsible for them, and he would realise that the project has been subject to a full and complete scrutiny by the Auditor-General of New South Wales and by the Public Accounts Committee of the New South Wales Parliament under a Liberal Party chairman, who have been through the project with a fine toothcomb. But I share the regrets of the honourable member for Pearce about the delays. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, it is worth saying that up until the middle of 1988, at which time the Greiner Government was in power, the Museum project, from an industrial relations point of view, was no better or worse than other major projects in the private sector in the central business district of Sydney. There is no doubt that the prevailing construction boom in Sydney at the time put great pressure upon an already overheated market for skilled labour. That is a fact. It is also undeniable that there was nothing about the National Maritime Museum up until about the middle of 1988 that clearly distinguished it from private construction projects throughout the city. That was the case until at least September 1988, at which stage the Darling Harbour Authority noted that the project was only three months from completion and that the hand-over to the Commonwealth was ready to take place at the end of the bicentennial year. That forecast was subsequently revised as a result of a major industrial dispute that began shortly thereafter, a dispute which was to have disastrous implications on the cost and completion date for the project. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to examine the circumstances surrounding the closing down of the site because it exposes the folly of the Greiner Government's management of this industrial dispute. It commenced in the wake of a heavy downpour in Sydney when the site safety committee at Darling Harbour declared that the workplace was unsafe. It should be noted that the same committee was charged with the statutory responsibility for site safety under the New South Wales occupational health and safety regulations. The committee's decision followed an inspection of the project which revealed large amounts of water on the ground surrounding the site. I am not here to blindly defend questionable work practices, but it is worthy of note that the management of Darling Harbour made no attempt to obtain contrary safety advice from the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry-that is, alternative advice provided under the New South Wales legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the declaration that the site was unsafe for work, a truck arrived for unloading. A foreman contractor then involved himself and instructed site workers to unload the vehicle in contravention of the safety committee ruling. What followed was a stop-work meeting at which it was resolved that work would be temporarily halted and a claim made for wages lost as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> They are all matters of fact. The Greiner Government instructed the Darling Harbour Construction Authority not to negotiate a settlement which would involve any payment for time lost. As a result, the site closed down completely. During the period of the shut-down-six months in total-the project haemorrhaged disastrously and the deadline for completion had to be extended. Hence when the site reopened six months later in March 1989 it was further from completion than it had been in September the previous year. Indeed, another nine months was to pass before the three months outstanding work was completed. </PARA>
<PARA> A further nine months of squabbling with the Commonwealth on issues of funding took place before the project was finally handed over on 2 October 1990. In the intervening period the cost of the project had skyrocketed, largely because of the Greiner Government's approach to industrial relations. The fixed cost of the project for plant, equipment, cranes and the like amounted to more than $200,000 per week-that is, $200,000 per week for the six months the project lay idle. The cost of the shut-down to the taxpayers on these items alone amounted to $5m. In the process the building contractor collapsed and an alternative company had to be sought to complete the project. Additional holding charges, together with the cost of restarting the project and restoring productivity, always difficult after such a shut-down, added a great deal more to the total cost. As a result, the New South Wales Government wasted millions of dollars on a dispute which industry analysts all agree could have-and, indeed, should have-been solved in a matter of hours at a cost of only a few thousand dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than negotiate a settlement and see work resume, the Greiner Government was intent on confrontation in this dispute. Its approach was simple: no compromise under any circumstances, the baseball bat approach to industrial relations. It is reminiscent of the destructive approach to industrial relations of the Fraser Government which this Government has done so much to repair. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the problems experienced by the Greiner Government can be attributed to two factors. The first is the Greiner Government's desire to confront the building unions. With this objective in mind, the National Maritime Museum provided the ideal opportunity to do so, given that it was a Federal Government project. The second reason was that responsibility for the Darling Harbour project had shifted to a weak Minister, a truly pathetic Minister, in the form of Mr David Hay. Mr Hay, it seems, was thoroughly incapable of understanding that the State would have to foot the bill for his paralysis of decision-making in failing to settle the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in the final wash-up, and the resultant funding dispute with the Commonwealth, it was the Greiner Government which capitulated on all points and, predictably, it is now the New South Wales taxpayer who will pay for the folly. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of management, the Greiner Government's performance on the National Maritime Museum would run a very close second to its squandering of millions on the Eastern Creek Raceway fiasco. But both disasters would be topped by its abandonment of the Darling Harbour casino project-a project designed to cover all the capital and loans servicing costs associated with the elements of the Darling Harbour redevelopment. The mind boggles when one sees that the casino site has been disposed of for less than $140m, a sum equal to the projected first year's income from the casino. In terms of asset sales, it amounts to one of the best bargains that private sector developers have obtained from the ongoing New South Wales garage sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the National Maritime Museum and say something about safety issues that relate to the project. Over the past year much has been made of alleged safety abuses by the union movement during the construction of the Darling Harbour project. At all times it should be remembered that the construction industry is inherently dangerous and that high standards of work protection must therefore be pursued. We make no apology for adopting and enshrining this principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, a construction worker's family has a right to expect that such protection will be provided. The family has a right to expect that family members will return home from work each day, safe and in one piece. Far from wishing to abuse safety committees, we were anxious to provide the highest standards of protection for all construction workers. That was, after all, our most important responsibility. In the final analysis the safety record of Darling Harbour speaks for itself. In four short years a total of l.5 million man hours of work were performed under the direct control of the Darling Harbour Authority. In those four years the number of class one accidents which resulted from the 1.5 million man hours of effort was exactly one. That particular class one accident involved a worker losing his thumb. It is a safety record unrivalled by any other major project undertaken in Australia or, for that matter, the rest of the world. It is a record of which all of those involved in the project would be justifiably proud. Those who would criticise the safety requirements of the Darling Harbour site should perhaps ponder the comparative safety record of the Brisbane Expo site, with its tragic loss of workers' lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Maritime Museum has already received significant support from its sponsors and contributors. Today I wish to single out the ANZ Banking Group Ltd and the United States Government for their generous support for the project. I am also particularly pleased with the intention of the Museum management actively to seek private support to supplement the millions of dollars that the Museum will receive from our Government. The beneficiaries of all our efforts will in the end be the tens of millions of visitors that the Museum will attract in future years. Those visitors will include our children and our children's children, and it is they who will be enriched by the maritime heritage passed on through the Museum's exhibitions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already stated that the Museum could not have been built without the personal support of the Prime Minister. I would also like to thank each of the Ministers at the Federal level who supported the project. The foresight of the Wran Labor Government will stand in contrast to the whingeing scepticism of our political opponents. All too well I recall the original description of the project by the then New South Wales Opposition Leader, Mr Greiner, as nothing but a `bicentennial gimmick'. `What', he said, `will we do with the windswept empty canyons of Darling Harbour after the Bicentenary?'. Fifteen million visitors in the last financial year could well provide him with the answer to that question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the chance to speak to the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill. At the outset I would like to say that I do have a couple of interests in the Museum, which was and remains a concept, as the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) observed, which enjoys bipartisan support. For one thing I have a deep commitment to history and to the belief that an understanding of history, and especially one's own history, can be of immense value to a community, particularly to a community, I might add, like ours, living in uncertain and anxious times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian National Maritime Museum can, I believe, greatly help in this regard and for that reason I am an enthusiastic supporter of it. There can be little doubt that a major contribution to the understanding and appreciation of our past is linked, in a way that few people in Australia seem to fully understand any more, with our oceans and our geographical isolation. I have no doubt that an appreciation of our past can and will result from the establishment of this facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for my interest in this Museum is that my wife's father, Rear Admiral Andrew Robertson, had an extensive involvement with the Museum, particularly in its early days. It is probably appropriate to record the nature of that connection by quoting the words of others. Senator Chapman in the Senate referred to Rear Admiral Robertson, the original Deputy Chairman of the Museum Council, as having `convinced the Government of the efficacy of establishing a maritime museum' when he spoke during the second reading debate on the Bill in the Senate on 24 August this year. </PARA>

There is no doubt in my mind that it is appropriate to acknowledge and pay tribute in this place to the role played by the original Maritime Museum Council and, in particular, the three key members who were not, as it transpired, to remain on that Council. Those three members were the Chairman, Mr Alex Dix, the previously mentioned Deputy Chairman, Rear Admiral Andrew Robertson, and Ms Kristine Klugman. Those people were described, again in Senator Chapman's words, as having had particular expertise in maritime history. May their efforts be duly noted and appreciated, not just in this place but by all those Australians who will undoubtedly benefit from the fruits of their energies and labours in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill before us establishes the Australian National Maritime Museum as an independent statutory authority and provides for the Museum at Darling Harbour in Sydney and for the establishment of a Museum Council to take the place of the interim council. The quality of the location of the Museum itself and of its charter are such that it is a deep shame that so much controversy has surrounded its coming into being. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald of 15 October 1988 commented about the Australian National Maritime Museum:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is a creature of politics. It was created as an election ploy and was from the outset manipulated to further political ends. </PARA>
<PARA>As the honourable member for Pearce has observed, those are harsh words indeed, and they come not from political observers but from the free press. That this should be so is a great pity in view of the significance and potential of the project. The decision to establish the project was taken when the Wran Government was facing the 1984 election in New South Wales. The Government wanted to develop a major project as part of its Darling Harbour bicentennial project. Indeed, it was to become one of Australia's more ambitious and far-sighted bicentennial projects. </PARA>
<PARA> An agreement was reached with the Hawke Labor Government in time for Wran to go to the polls in 1984. That agreement provided for some $30m to construct the Museum, based on little more, it seems, than some back-of-the-envelope calculations as to the likely nature and cost of the building, without regard to likely cost overruns or non-building establishment and subsequent running costs. Having reached a very rough agreement to the effect that the Commonwealth should contribute $30m, the Wran Government and Mr Brereton, the then State Minister responsible for Darling Harbour, signed up without further ado. </PARA>
<PARA> It did not take long for problems to emerge. As the design was developed and the building progressed, the cost began to grow and grow and grow. It continued to grow, as we have heard, until it reached around $70m, over double the original estimates-$40m over budget. That process was aided by industrial disputation, despite the reports at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bulletin magazine of 8 April 1986 records, interestingly, that the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) had secured a gentlemanly agreement with the Darling Harbour Authority which was supposedly going to ignore the deregistration proceedings that were under way at that time. The report claimed that union leaders were told that no matter what deregistration strife went on outside the Darling Harbour project, which was of vital political importance to the New South Wales Government, it must not be delayed. The report stated that it was believed to be the first time a government instrumentality had offered any form of commitment on security of employment to the BLF. So much for the way things were done in New South Wales under the guiding hand-if that is the word-of the previous Labor Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), who was the Minister responsible at the time of the initiation of this project in New South Wales, observed that the industrial disputes that went on were, in his words, no better and no worse than was the case on other sites in Sydney at that time. I find that hardly reassuring or hardly making for happy contemplation. It only goes to show just how appalling industrial relations in the building industry in that city have been. That perception is, to my way of thinking, only heightened by knowledge of the supposed relationship that was struck between the Darling Harbour Authority and those honourable gentlemen who constitute the BLF. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member's reference to the Greiner Government's sale of the casino site likewise reflects a pragmatic but rather unsatisfactory attitude towards public administration. I simply remind the House, as was done by means of an attempted interjection a few moments ago, of the problems associated with allocation of the licence for the casino and make the comment that I do not think anyone could dispute that New South Wales is better off both without the casino and without that Labor Administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that he has not stayed to hear further contributions to the debate. The current New South Wales Government in this case is quite innocent. No blame for the massive cost overrun can be fairly attributed to it, yet the New South Wales Government, on behalf of the people of New South Wales, has had to pick up the difference between the original offer by the Commonwealth and the final cost-a difference, I may remind the House again, of $40m; a great deal of money in anyone's terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The refusal of this Government to pay those outstanding costs held matters up even further, despite the clear spirit and intention of the 1984 agreement, which was that the Federal Government would construct the Museum. To add insult to injury, the Federal Government made it quite clear that should litigation result in a victory to New South Wales, and an instruction that the Commonwealth should pay the outstanding $40m, New South Wales could expect to see its grants in future suitably trimmed. This approach to Federal-State relations, I would suggest, is worthy of the fullest condemnation. As this Government refuses to cut its own expenditure, it seems to be only too happy to go on squeezing the States, local government and statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales, in the face of these threatened reductions in expenditure grants, gave way and handed over the Museum to the Federal Government, which now gets the credit for the whole deal despite having paid for less than half of it. It is a cause for deep regret that this project has become a political creature; it deserves better. It is to be hoped that it is upwards all the way from here for the National Maritime Museum. I believe that the Museum should shortly come to be an exciting and important institution in this country, one which all Australians can enjoy and benefit from. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated at the outset, I believe that an understanding of history is undervalued in contemporary Australia. Henry Ford, of automotive fame, once remarked that history is bunk-a well-known quotation; everybody has heard it. Although I have some doubts that he ever said it or ever meant it, it is widely used as indicating in some way that we need not worry about our past because it is of little value to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, if he ever did say it he certainly went on to change his mind in his later years. He set up a very extensive museum near his factory in Dearborn and he began to roam the country spending vast amounts of money looking for exhibits from a bygone rural age of America. He came to believe that the future would be a more secure and understandable place for people and their children if they had the advantage of understanding their past and their cultural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said as well-this is another quote-that the only thing we can learn from history is that we do not learn from history. I believe that that is an unduly pessimistic and limited view. The fact is that we can learn from the mistakes and the victories of the past. It may be true that we often do not learn from history, but that in itself is not an excuse. It is a very wise and sensible thing for a society to pass on to its young an understanding of its past, warts and all. I find it interesting that we are sometimes more inclined in Australia to advocate this truth in the case of Aboriginal Australians than we are for white Australians. We seem to have some sort of cultural cringe when it comes to developing in ourselves a solid understanding of our own cultural background and the heritage that it should be able to very profitably pass onto us. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, I would like to touch on the value that I believe an understanding of our maritime past can be to us in Australia. For example, we think of the immense courage of the original seamen who tried to find the great south land, as it was then known, and who then sought to charter it. There was the bravery, innovation and sheer technical brilliance of Captain James Cook, perhaps the greatest navigator the world has ever seen. Consider the leadership shown by the naval officer, Captain Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales, who limited himself to the same starvation rations as the wretched convicts under his control as he and his unwilling band of fellow Europeans sought to establish a toehold in an inhospitable land. The examples set under conditions far worse than we can ever imagine in contemporary Australia, for all of our problems and all of our economic woes and privations, should inspire us to battle on and find a way forward and not give up hope. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there were the famous clipper ships which sought to establish speed and efficiency records for the transportation of goods between Australia and the old country. Fierce competition saw great striving for the best possible results, a far cry indeed from our pathetic attempts to upgrade our waterfront and shipping performances today. Then we surely led the world. Now we aim for and seem to miss nebulous targets like Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development averages. We should accept the challenge to respond to the tyranny of distance, as Geoffrey Blainey called it, with innovation and flair and courage and initiative, as did our forebears in the face of immense difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thought is that much of our nation's wealth was built on agricultural trade with Britain in particular. A major breakthrough in this trade was the technology of refrigeration, developed and perfected here in Australia, which allowed for the export of frozen meat across the world. If ever we needed a surge of this sort of leading edge technology and development and application of technology, it is surely today. History tells us that we could do it once; history should indicate to us that there is no reason why we cannot do it again. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Navy, once a very powerful force on the world stage, has seen noble and brave service, particularly in two world wars. We can and should be reminded of the debt we owe those who fought and died for our freedom, often in horrific circumstances, just as we are reminded of the horrors of war, given that fewer and fewer Australians have had any direct knowledge of war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a good thing and surely to be commended that the charter of the Museum allows for the effective fulfilment of all of these desirable objectives. I hope and trust that the Council will use those freedoms, that those who serve on the Museum Council will seek to maximise their opportunity, and indeed I suggest responsibility, to educate, to inform, to store information, to preserve our most valuable history and perhaps above all, at the same time as they teach us, to challenge us to respond to the standards and initiatives shown by those who have gone before us. </PARA>
<PARA> To that end, I comment on one area in the Bill where we have problems, as has already been touched on by the honourable member for Pearce. It is my absolute belief that people over the age of 65 should not be excluded from directorship of the Museum or from serving on the Council. It is not simply a question of age discrimination, which the Opposition has plainly stated is unacceptable to it. It is also important because some of the very people who have the widest experience in the field of our maritime past are over 65 years of age. That is likely to be a situation that applies generally to museums and to all times and ages. To lose these people because of some minor difficulty-as I understand it, in this case, with Comcare legislation-would be a major loss indeed, not just to those who were thus ruled ineligible for service but also for the Museum itself and for those who stand to benefit from using it and learning from its exhibits and stored information. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain moves have been made to address this matter. I am sorry that thus far the Government's excuse for opposing our desire to amend these age provisions continues to stand, but I hope that we can come to a sensible and early agreement to rectify what seems to me to be quite a stupid and superfluous anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> Having outlined, albeit very briefly tonight, the advantages that I believe can accrue to the nation and the people from the Museum, and having drawn attention to the major remaining defect, as we see it, in the Bill as it now stands, I finish by wishing the Museum and all associated with it a bright, happy and valuable future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Australian National Maritime Museum Amendment Bill, which will enable the establishment of the Australian National Maritime Museum as a statutory authority. It is unfortunate to hear the sour note introduced by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), and to an extent by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), into what has been generally a positive discussion. My attention was drawn to the remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir because, whilst lauding our maritime history and the role that shipping and seafarers have played in the establishment of this nation, he took the opportunity to castigate people on the waterfront and in shipping-the very people who are being asked to turn their lives and arrangements upside down and who have made a major contribution to this country over the years. One does not achieve support, cooperation and progress by going back to the old slogan of `Blame the wharfies, blame the seamen'. As far back as I can remember, that has been the catchcry of the conservatives sitting opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gwydir made some comments about the great competition of the clipper ships. If he looks back at some of the history of the clipper ships and the sailing ships, particularly the foreign ships, he will see that it is not a history that one would want to laud in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is long overdue. Australia has been slow to give national recognition to its maritime heritage. We have been slow to give national recognition to the vital role that shipping and seafarers have played in the discovery, settlement and development of our nation. We need to remember that Australia was born out of and developed on the shoulders of the shipping industry, and our future rides on the decks of the shipping industry. While the ships of the sea have been displaced in the carriage of passengers by the ships of the sky, the fact is that 95 per cent of our international trade is carried in ships, and that figure is not likely to move very much in the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that Australia ranges between being the third and fifth largest shipping market in the world on a cargo distance carried basis, one would expect Australia to have a strong and vibrant shipping industry. That is not and has not been the case, even though the industry is in a major period of progress and improvement and is trying to assert a stronger role in world shipping markets. If we look at history, as I will mention later, foreign shipowners, political ideology, political factors and, to some extent, some members of the industry did not allow that industry to develop. It is unfortunate-I again refer to the remarks made by the honourable member for Gwydir-that we go back to the old slogan, `It is the seamen or the wharfies'-the old scapegoat of country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until the Pigott Committee of Inquiry into Museums and National Collections in 1975 that the need for a national maritime museum was recognised-and that was 187 years after settlement. It was almost two centuries after settlement before we, as a nation, got around to even recognising that there ought to be a national maritime museum. So when the Museum opens in the latter half of next year at Darling Harbour in Sydney it will give for the first time a national emphasis to our maritime history. It will help bring home to Australians their reliance on the sea and the role that seafarers have played in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Museum will work in cooperation with other museums, be they public or private, and that the Museum will seek to complement existing State, Territory and regional organisations. A number of regional maritime museums will be strengthened by the cooperative policy to be pursued by the Australian National Maritime Museum. Various collections of maritime artefacts and historical items around Australia have not resulted from the action of governments but from the actions of individuals, former seafarers and local communities, who have had the foresight and interest to preserve the history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth referring back to when the industry began. For the first few years after the founding of the colony, the industry involved little more than the unloading of store ships and transports which had made the long voyage under sail from England and the operating of small craft in trade to and from Parramatta and the Hawkesbury River. Overseas trade could be said to have begun in 1792 when the brigantine Philadelphia brought a general cargo to Sydney from the United States of America (USA). No register of shipping was kept until 1800 and, in the first six months of that year, 10 inward ships, averaging 272 tonnes, and 13 outward, averaging 313 tonnes, were recorded. By contrast, in 1835, a total of 292 vessels reached Sydney from many parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the role of foreign shipowners in the development of Australian industry. The record shows that in 1801 a system of pilotage was established and that in 1813 rates of pilotage were gazetted. These included discriminatory rates against ships not on the British or East India Company registers. In other words, from the very beginning, Australia was a captive market for the British shipping companies. If we go back through history, little attempt has ever been made to look at the development of an efficient and expanding Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at coastal shipping, we see that the first trade along the New South Wales coast was between Sydney and the Hawkesbury River. Later it extended to the Hunter River, and soon trading spread to other settlements along the coast both north and south of Sydney. We have all read of the Sophia Jane, which arrived on 13 May 1831 under sail. The first paddle steamer built in this country was William the Fourth, built in 1831 on the Williams River, a tributary of the Hunter River. She made her first voyage in February 1832, operating between Parkers Wharf in Sydney and Greenhills in the Hunter, now known as Morpeth. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back at the change of passenger transport and transport generally around the colonies, we see that in 1929 coastal passenger trade by sea to the south coast of New South Wales ceased altogether as a result of the arrival of the motor car. Later, the wartime disruption of coastal passenger services resulted in passengers moving to rail and road transport. Even though the passenger services were restored after the Second World War, the passengers did not come back. </PARA>
<PARA> There is so much to be said for the history of Australian shipping, of our seafarers, of our merchant mariners, of those who suffered the privations of having to travel those journeys of so many months from Europe to Australia. So little recognition is given to their contributions, to their difficulties, to their privations. I note with pleasure that the opening of the Australian National Maritime Museum in the latter half of next year is to be based on six themes: discovery-the finding of Australia, focusing on the first voyages, in this case by the Aborigines over 40,000 years ago and their continuing involvement with the sea; secondly, passengers-the long sea voyage and the exhibition about the experience of people moving by ship and showing the dangers, the risks, the discomforts and the hardships of the long sea passage of the convicts, the families and the refugees of the early period; and then a third exhibition about commerce-the working sea, about which I have had something to say already; fourthly, the Navy and the role of protecting Australia; fifthly, leisure, sun, surf and sails; and lastly, Australia and the United States of America-linked by sea. That exhibition is being funded as a bicentennial gift from the US Government in the amount of $US5m. As to the vessels and the services that operated between the United States and Australia, I mentioned that in 1792 the first international trade was recorded with the ship Philadelphia, which came here with goods from the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn back to my own city of Newcastle and the Hunter region. In 1849 the Georgiana was the first ship to set sail from Newcastle to the USA. The following year, 1850, saw the commencement of the first voyage direct from San Francisco to Newcastle. I shall say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1861 the Nimrod began a regular service to San Francisco. It is interesting also that people from Melbourne and Sydney wanting passage to California had to come to Newcastle to join the service, not the converse today where people from Newcastle go to either Sydney or Melbourne to join the air service. In those days it was the reverse. The development of those services helped set in place the growth of Australia and many of those services revolved around the gold rush and the period of the gold rush with people from the United States coming to Australia to join in the gold rush and then the rapid development of Australia that followed in that period. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also this evening to bring before the Parliament the need for us as a nation to recognise the role played by our wartime merchant mariners in the defence and in the support of this country. It is only in recent times that we have begun to recognise the sacrifices of our wartime merchant mariners. It was on 7 October that the Governor-General unveiled the national memorial to wartime merchant mariners-almost 50 years-45 years-after the end of World War II before as a nation we recognised the sacrifices of those Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In World War II, 637 Australian merchant mariners lost their lives on Australian vessels and approximately 3,500 Australian merchant mariners were lost while serving on Allied merchant navy ships. A total of 73 vessels, naval and merchant, were pursued, damaged or sunk in Australian waters and adjacent to Australian waters during World War II. Of those vessels, 54 were Allied merchant vessels and of those 54, some 38 were sunk. In two years time we are moving in Newcastle to establish a memorial there to the first two Australian ships that were sunk by enemy action in 1942: the Iron Chieftain and the Iron Knight. I am pleased to say that living in Newcastle still are survivors of both those vessels, but they were the first two Australian ships sunk by the Japanese during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to mention a constituent of mine who has been a tireless worker on behalf of merchant mariners: Bob Nelson. He lives at Mount Hutton-sure it is in my electorate; but it would not matter where he lives, because he has supporters and people working with him in cooperation around this nation. But Bob and his colleagues have worked tirelessly to try to bring to the notice of the Parliament, the Government and the Australian people the role played by Australia's wartime merchant mariners. It has been this Government that has given merchant mariners access to service pensions. It was this Government that established the McGirr inquiry to look into the rights and entitlements of Australia's wartime merchant mariners. </PARA>
<PARA> The major recommendation of the McGirr report is that wartime merchant mariners should have access under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, so giving them the same entitlements as those given to veterans. That recommendation has yet to be considered by the Government, but I make my position very clear, Mr Deputy Speaker. I strongly support the recommendation, and I hope that it has the support of both sides of the Parliament. It is long overdue. It is a recognition long overdue, and I hope that when the Government comes to consider it, it will have the support of the Government and we will see it enacted into law. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I mentioned the first international trade to Australia. I want also to mention the fact-again going back to home base in the Hunter region-that the first export from this nation was 150 tonnes of coal in 1801 that was collected around the shoreline of the entrance to what was then Coal River, now the Hunter River at Newcastle, then Kingstown, and around the foreshores of Nobby's Island, which is now part of the extension of the shoreline and is the breakwater and entrance to the port of Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> That 150 tonnes of coal was gathered-it lay there waiting to be picked up-and put on board the Anna Josepha, shipped down to Sydney and transferred to the Earl of Cornwallis and sold off to Bengal. That is how tough things were in those days. But it is worth going back, remembering and understanding where and how it all began and what an opportunity this nation has missed in the development of a strong and vibrant shipping industry. I hope it is an opportunity we are going to take up and develop further as time progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own electorate of the Hunter, Mr Deputy Speaker-your region-the regional capital is Newcastle. It is a great port of the nation, a great port of the Southern Hemisphere, and in that region we are beginning to recognise the importance of our maritime heritage and the vital role that ships and mariners have played in our history and growth. Ships were the only transport link to the rest of the colony and in 1797 Lieutenant John Shortland, after whom my electorate is named, was pursuing escaped convicts when he discovered what was then to be called Coal River, later the Hunter River. The William the Fourth, the first steamship built in Australia, which was referred to earlier, was built by the William Lowe family, shipbuilders, brought out from Scotland. The vessel was built on the banks of the Williams River just near Clarence Town at a place called Deptford. It was built of local timbers and sailed down to Sydney. The engine was brought out from Liverpool, a cast iron engine, I think of 16 horsepower, in two parts, then assembled and installed. The vessel commenced passenger services in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA> It was described in the Sydney Gazette at the time as `a splendid example of colonial enterprise', and the fare for the journey from Sydney to Newcastle was some 20 shillings, which was a week's wages-a vast difference from travel costs today. However, that vessel worked up and down the coast under the command of Captain Taggart and eventually was sold off in 1862 to China. In Newcastle we have built a full scale replica of that vessel as one of our bicentennial projects and that vessel operates in the port and it will operate to Nelson's Bay. We are in the process of raising some $125,000, which my colleagues opposite might like to contribute towards. </PARA>

That vessel will be moored at Lee Wharf at Newcastle and the Merewether Street wharf, and linked to that will be a local memorial to the role of merchant mariners and our wartime merchant mariners in time to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary in 1992 of the sinking of the Iron Knight and the Iron Chieftain. Also linked to it we hope will be a maritime art and photographic display-something along the lines of the Tate Gallery display in the port of Liverpool, where surplus wharfage accommodation continues to be available to the Tate Gallery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an excellent attraction to have put together. For those from the countryside, like the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), who are interested in fishermen's wharves, the headquarters of the local fishing industry is in Newcastle and they will have a real live fishermen's wharf where people can buy produce fresh from the boats as they come in, look at the displays on the William the Fourth, look at the South Steyne and dine aboard it, and look at the memorial to wartime merchant mariners. The Hunter region is bringing together its maritime history. </PARA>

<PARA> To return to the first vessel I mentioned, when the USS Eagle visited Newcastle at the end of 1987, in preparation for the Bicentenary, it brought to mind the visit of the first of the direct service ships, the Sacramento, to Newcastle in 1850. As I said, that was the beginning of a direct service from Newcastle to San Francisco. Looking at the cargo the vessel carried, one gets a real understanding of the hardships and the lifestyle of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the time available I will leave those matters, although I was going to incorporate some material. As I said earlier, I am pleased to see this legislation before the House and I am pleased that it has the support of both sides of the Parliament. I wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-As I understand it, the Opposition proposes to move amendments along the lines of those moved in the Senate. I do not propose to make a long contribution in my summation tonight, but I will make a couple of remarks about the contributions made by the four speakers in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the history of this project-some of which I guess could be described as a fairly sorry history, and in one sense a history we would not wish to repeat for a variety of reasons-we would all agree that its location is magnificent. Anyone who has had the opportunity to visit the site of the National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour would agree with those comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The points made tonight by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) reflected upon the importance of the site in terms of tourism potential, which is one of my ministerial responsibilities. No-one would have any doubts about the figures he quoted, which suggested that during calendar year 1989 somewhere in the order of 15 million people visited the site at Darling Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all the sad tales of woe, eventually it led to a very happy occasion, I must say, when the New South Wales Minister for Local Government and Planning, Mr David Hay, formally handed over the building to me, representing the Commonwealth Government, on 2 October this year. All who were present would agree that that ceremony will go down as a very memorable one-memorable in the sense that a lot of the things referred to in the debate tonight were at least behind us, and I think the New South Wales Minister would accept that. It is true that we have had our difficulties over the years. I do not propose to go through those in my summary remarks tonight, but I should say that in the end the negotiations between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Government, and in particular the roles played by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and Premier Greiner, made the eventual settlement to the mutual satisfaction of both governments a lot easier to achieve. I think that should be recognised in the debate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting also to hear of the significance accorded to maritime history by honourable members. One thing we often overlook is that we are an island continent. We are often inclined to look at our history on a continent basis rather than on a maritime basis. Apart from references to the explorations of some of the early Portuguese and Dutch sailors who came to Australia, and later the English explorers, our history often neglects the role of Australia's maritime past. I believe the Museum will go a long way towards redressing that inadequacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) in his contribution referred to the various themes that are part of the overall approach adopted by the National Maritime Museum, and it is significant to look at the themes of discovery, the finding of Australia, tracing the role of the Aborigines in their first voyages to this continent over 40,000 years ago. It is useful to reflect on the fact that we have been and are a country of immigrants, having had great waves of migration over a number of years. Except for the recent past, most of that migration has been by sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the theme I wish to refer to is that of the Navy protecting Australia. I say this as a result of the experience I had for a little under 12 months as a Minister with portfolio responsibilities in the Department of Defence. Too often we are neglectful, I believe, of the men and women who serve our country in the profession of arms. If we go back to the bicentennial year of 1988, in terms of crowds and participation generally during that year the most successful functions were those associated with the Australian defence forces-the naval review, the air show and the Army tattoo. Anyone who experienced those events during 1988 will certainly remember them, and it is also important to recognise the contribution of the Australian Navy to those themes. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) referred to the difficulties associated with the project and unfortunately sought to drag up a lot of the old political debate that is often associated, rightly or wrongly, with this project. The phrase `a creature of politics' was used on a number of occasions in reference to the National Maritime Museum, but, to be fair, if we are to accuse one side of playing politics we should acknowledge that the other side of politics, the conservative side, is not all clean in this regard. I well recall in the years leading up to the New South Wales election in 1988 that every time a road was not built, a new school was not constructed or an addition to a hospital was not completed in country New South Wales, National Party members were very quick to point to the reason for this-that it was all to do with all this money being poured into the Darling Harbour project in particular, and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith referred to this during his speech tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of being a creature of politics is not restricted to one side of politics. In fact, while the then New South Wales Opposition Leader, Mr Greiner, was often very critical of some of the things that were happening at Darling Harbour, he was all very keen to be associated with the official opening of the project in May 1988. I congratulate him for wanting to be associated with it and wanting to put some of those remarks behind him as, I think, his Minister Mr Hay did at the official handover of the maritime museum on 2 October. So I think we should be fair about this. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it serves very well the debate on this Bill to go through and dredge up, if you like, some of those events from the past. I do not think it is fair, necessarily, to suggest that all blame should lie with the unions in the case of some of the industrial problems that were associated with the cessation of work there for a period of six months, as indeed I would not suggest that all blame would lie with the Government or the management of the project. All I think we can say is that there was a series of events that made this project a very difficult one for a variety of reasons. Fortunately, I think that is right behind us. </PARA>
<PARA> I think, though, that the speakers generally in reference to the notion of the National Maritime Museum at least would acknowledge that it is an important part of a national collecting institution. Indeed, the fact that it has the ongoing task of gathering objects by purchase, loan, donation or, in fact, recovery from the sea will certainly assist the National Maritime Museum to be regarded as something that I am sure will attract a great deal of repeat business by people who wish to visit the Museum. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly going to be a very representative museum, as opposed to some of the more traditional approaches that are adopted at times in which it is sought to exhibit a particular class of objects and will allow a great deal of flexibility in terms of what is shown there. Already, of course, there is a significant collection and I encourage all honourable members to take the opportunity of contacting the National Maritime Museum because the Chairman of the interim council and, indeed, the Director are entitled to feel very proud of what they are doing there. They are particularly proud to be associated with a project that they know now is going to go full steam ahead until about October next year when the doors finally open to the public. I urge honourable members to take the opportunity to see for themselves, particularly before the building is fitted out, the magnificent potential of this building to celebrate our maritime past. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot conclude without making reference to my good friend the honourable member for Shortland and his dedicated enthusiasm for Newcastle and particularly his support for the notion of the regional museum. He would, of course, I am sure appreciate that at the Commonwealth level we have and accept responsibility for national collecting institutions. While we certainly applaud the work being done by regional museums, the honourable member for Shortland will have to accept the fact that in this case it will be a case of short hands and long pockets. But I am quite happy to accept his challenge and make a contribution on a personal basis to his regional museum because--</PARA>

I appreciate the honourable member's strong interest in transport matters, particularly in shipping. For many years, as most honourable members would be aware, before the election of the Hawke Government he had shadow responsibility for transport matters and, indeed, was a Minister for Transport in the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate tonight. I think, as I said, we can all look forward with a great deal of anticipation to seeing what will be a truly magnificent national collecting institution at a truly great site, a site that will attract not only domestic tourists and people from the broad public interested in our maritime history, but also the increasing numbers of international arrivals to our shores. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) Clause 30, page 14, lines 24-27, omit subclause (2). </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill, which has the general support of the Opposition, there is in fact one significant blemish and these amendments seek to rectify that. The blemish is that in two clauses of this Bill there are restrictions in terms of age with respect to people who may be appointed. I refer the Committee first to clause 17 which governs the membership of the Council of the Museum. We find in subclause (4) this provision:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who has attained the age of 65 years shall not be appointed as a member and a person shall not be appointed as a member for a period that extends beyond the day on which the person will attain the age of 65 years.</PARA>
<PARA>That provision governs appointment to a council which has the function of ensuring the proper and efficient performance of the functions of the Museum and determining the policy of the Museum. Later in clause 30 of the Bill, which deals with the director of the Museum, we find a similar provision which prohibits a person of the age of 65 being appointed as director and also limits the appointment of any person who is appointed to the day on which the person attains the age of 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two fundamental reasons why these provisions are in error. The first reason relates to the operation of this Museum which would, I believe, be enhanced by being able to draw upon the best talent available without regard to age. I thank the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) who in his speech on the second reading dealt with this issue of principle very well. He pointed out that many of the people who are peculiarly able to contribute to understanding of the issues that will be faced by the Museum, people who are peculiarly cognisant of the history of maritime matters, may well be people of mature years. In those circumstances, we are potentially depriving this Museum of people who could be of enormous value to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The second broad concern, though, is a matter of simple justice, and it is the view of the Opposition parties-a view which is reflected in our formal and published policies-that those people in Australia who are aged 65 and over should not be treated as second-class citizens. It is our view that those people are entitled to be dealt with without discrimination on the grounds of age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are totally opposed to this or any other legislation which does discriminate against Australians on the ground of age. I am assisted by the interjection of my friend the honourable member for Warringah. It is going to take me a long time to get used to this extraordinary habit of referring to people by their electorates. The honourable member for Warringah has made the point that, in New South Wales, this matter has been the subject of legislation. It is strange that a parliament which has-with the unanimous support of the parties in this place-legislated against discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion and race, still permits legislation to be passed which discriminates against Australians on the ground of their age.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the logic of this position, we face the quite extraordinary situation that an Australian over the age of 65 may be on the Council of the Australian National Library or the Council of the Australian National Gallery or, indeed, on the Council of the National Museum-but it is not good enough for that person to be appointed to the Council of this particular Maritime Museum. It is, in fact, a quite incoherent position under Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> But this Bill, which provides that employees be subject to the Public Service Act, is not even consistent with the Public Service Act, which itself permits at least a waiver of the restrictions on people aged over 65. I think that it is an absolute disgrace that the Australian Labor Party is prepared to vote in favour of provisions which discriminate against aged Australians in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> In the end, I think in judging the way we want to treat Australians it is not a bad idea to start by saying: How do I expect to be treated myself? I have always thought that one of the greatest blessings that one can have as an individual is the capacity to ease out of employment at the rate that one decides-not at the rate some outsider decides. Indeed, I was sitting on a plane the other day with a director of a major company who was certainly very much in excess of this retiring age and who is still doing major work which I think is for the benefit of this country, because he brings such a depth of experience to bear. I really do appeal to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is seated at the table, to justify the Government's stance on this point. I do not believe it is possible to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that for some reason the matter of potential claims for compensation is the reason for denying people over 65 the entitlement to continue either as a director or as a member of the Council of the Maritime Museum is, again, a footling defence when we realise that people over the age of 65 are entitled to participate in all these other bodies and, indeed, in the Public Service itself. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Opposition seeks a little more reason from the Government than we were able to obtain in the Senate; we seek, in fact, the Government's agreement to the deletion of these two subclauses of the Bill, because we think they are grossly unfair to those members of the Australian community who are over 65; and we think also that those provisions are not in the best interests of this institution itself, which may be able to benefit greatly from drawing on the services of people who have had long experience in this maritime area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to say that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)-who, I think, is still slightly under the age of 65-did demonstrate in his contribution the value of a long interest in these matters, just as I thought the contribution of my colleague the honourable member for Gwydir, with his background as a historian, brought a very interesting mind to bear on the content of this Bill and on the importance of this institution. The honourable member for Shortland, as I say, has demonstrated his long interest and considerable knowledge of matters of maritime history. Certainly he has talked of things which I am sure I would not ever have learnt about, but for his telling us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it hard to believe that there might be some suggestion on the Government's part that, when the honourable member for Shortland reaches the magic age of 65, he suddenly becomes incapable of using that lifetime of work, experience and knowledge in the public interest on this institution. I think that is a very good example. The honourable member for Shortland may well, by the time he has attained the age of 65, be one of the premier and most knowledgeable people in this area. He may be a person that we in Government might wish to appoint, having done so much to convince us that he has the depth of knowledge that is required. I think it would be tragic if he were deprived of this wonderful end to his working life because of the intransigent, intolerant and bigoted approach of the Government which is prepared to treat the people of Australia who are aged over 65 in this shabby manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government acknowledges some of the broad points of principle that both the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) made during their contributions tonight. Indeed, we recognise that this whole question of age discrimination is a very important issue and probably will be of increasing importance to our community as the age profile of our community changes over the course of the next few years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1989, there was a working party on barriers to the employment of older people within our community, and the Attorney-General's Department is presently undertaking a very comprehensive review of age discrimination in employment, including the points that have been alluded to and are the subject of this amendment tonight. I might say for the benefit of the honourable members here tonight that consultations have already been held with a very wide ranging group of people, including representatives of other Commonwealth departments and authorities; State and Territory governments; industry; and community groups-representing, I might say, both ends of the age spectrum, from the elderly to the youth in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has received a report from his Department on the issues that have been raised in the review to date and, importantly I guess, on some of the possible measures to overcome problems of age discrimination. I have been further advised that the Attorney-General plans to issue a discussion paper within the next three months which will be followed by a series of consultations and, hopefully, legislation some time during next year. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in his remarks earlier the honourable member for Pearce identified one of the concerns we have, and that is compensation requirements. I do not think it is fair for him to dismiss the reason why the Government is not accepting this particular amendment because of what he regards as a fairly insignificant issue-that is, compensation. Employees who are aged 65 and over, if injured, would in fact have to rely on ex gratia payments if in fact there were some compensation case. We also obviously have to look at the implications of any changes in these arrangements for the Government's broad retirement income policies, and obviously this could involve changes in other arrangements that may affect taxation and superannuation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is not necessarily the simple matter that the Opposition makes it out to be. I think within this House generally there would be some sympathy for the point that has been raised, and we are not dismissive of the suggestion that is part of the amendment simply because we somehow think that age 65 has some sort of magic sound about it-but rather it has been the subject of a number of pieces of legislation that have included provisions for council members and board members to retire at that age. On the question of the chief executive of those organisations, in most cases, certainly in my jurisdiction, 65 is the norm. This applies not in all cases, but it is generally the case. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters are extremely complex with implications, as I have said, for a wide range of areas that come under Commonwealth legislation and affect, obviously, the policies and the practices of the Commonwealth. Neither I nor the Government believe that it is appropriate at this stage to make some sort of piecemeal changes without a thorough study of the implications, including, obviously, the cost and, certainly, the benefits of possible changes, and, importantly, the mechanism by which any such changes could be introduced. For those reasons, the Government finds the Opposition amendments unacceptable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to the debate tonight with a degree of interest and did not intend to take part in it, but I must say I find myself quite frankly amazed by the speech of the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons). Obviously he has his starting instructions from his colleagues, but the degree of inconsistency in what he has just said is fascinating. Already there are Commonwealth instrumentalities with no age limit on their membership. To talk about consistency and seeking to achieve that is simply flagrant nonsense. The fact is that there are already Commonwealth instrumentalities in which what we are seeking to achieve is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the Minister to stand up and use such specious arguments does him no credit whatsoever, quite apart from the principle of the thing. Rather than hiding behind the skirts of the Attorney-General and some investigation that is going on at present, I think that the Minister owes it to the people of Australia, particularly to those who have capacity, talent and special expertise in areas such as this, to provide a more meaningful input to the debate than the one that he has just come forward with. I think it is entirely inconsistent. It does not recognise what is already the case, and I think he should do himself and his reputation more credit by facing up to the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know the customs of this place very well, but if the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) does not have the courtesy to reply, I think we will keep this debate going for a while. I have to say that my colleague and friend the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) made points which, I think, warrant some return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can actually remember the time when Ministers thought that the Parliament should function and that they had a bit of ministerial authority. I am rather sorry that the late Jim Cavanagh is the late Jim Cavanagh because he actually thought that Parliament had a role to play and that part of its role was to take nonsense out of Bills. I have to say that I learned from the late Senator Cavanagh that we should not treat this chamber as something that is run by those characters over there who advise the Government. It is supposed to be run by members of parliament. It is no wonder that this place is regarded with contempt by the public. It does not do anything. All it does is talk. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Bill before this Parliament which has a provision that the Opposition finds objectionable. That provision is that no Australian who is over the age of 65 is deemed to be worthy, fit or capable to be either director of the National Maritime Museum or to serve on its council. That is a pretty simple proposition. It is not very complicated. One does not need a doctorate in philosophy to think about it or to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is saying that we cannot see why this law cannot be the same as the law which governs the Australian National Library, the Australian National Gallery, the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Heritage Commission, all of which, it seems to me, have something in common with this body. Basically, they are about preserving the history, heritage and culture of this, our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the scribblers over there think. I do not know whether they are the people who give the Minister his instructions or whether this is just a typical example of why Westminster parliaments are falling into decay, disrepair and disrepute. One of my colleagues, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), said something about Sir Humphrey. That was certainly the case. The Minister's reply could have been changed, put on television and given everybody a good laugh. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to the Government, let me contrast that with the behaviour of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The first time I spoke on a Bill in this place-on the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Bill-I pointed out to the Minister that there were some rather suspect provisions in the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation Treaty in so far as the protection of the environment was concerned. He actually sat at the table, looked at the provisions and said, `There might be something in that, but I will have to go away and consider it and then I will give you an answer'. The next day he said, `Yes, there is something in that. We are going to have to talk to the Indonesians about changing the treaty'. Since then he has written to me and said, `Yes, we are doing it'. That gave me a faint glimmer of hope that maybe the Parliament was worth having, but having listened to the Minister tonight, I cannot say that I feel that way now. Why are we wasting time having a debate on the committee stage when the Minister does not even have the common courtesy to respond to my colleague the honourable member for Warringah? Is it because he is embarrassed at defending what is indefensible? If this amendment is accepted, it will not make the Commonwealth's provisions more incoherent. Indeed, with respect to the body of legislation which touches on bodies of this kind, it will make it more coherent and consistent. I believe that that would be a good thing. I do not believe that the Minister at the table for a moment would, in private, seek to personally justify the view that Australians over the age of 65 are unfit or should be automatically deemed to be unfit for these positions. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say to the Minister that I have been in the same position as he is. I remember representing the then Minister Nixon when the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee reported for the first time on deficiencies of legislation. As the Minister at the table, I accepted two amendments. I would ask the Minister to behave like a member of parliament, to actually consider the merits of the case that the Opposition has put forward and to stop treating this as some sort of debating shop where the Sir Humphreys, the Caucus and everybody else matters, but what we do in here does not matter a damn. </PARA>
<PARA> I just say that we are putting forward a sensible amendment which is fair to the older people in Australia and which is in the interests of the National Museum. I think this debate is a very good demonstration, as I said before, of why people do not believe that this Parliament has a contribution to make to the national welfare and why so many people are turned off by politics when the Minister cannot even give us a sensible reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all very well for the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) to come in with his mock indignation, to enter this debate and to make some smart comments about the role of advisers and departmental officials. That might go over very well with some of his parliamentary colleagues, but, quite frankly, it does not really cut any ice with me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the important point is that I have at least acknowledged at the outset some of the broad principles of the Opposition amendment in terms of age discrimination. However, I think I owe some sort of loyalty to and have an obligation to accept the guidance of my legal ministerial colleagues, in this case, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who has a report and who has given me an assurance that this report is being looked at. I have indicated that in my remarks and I could not see any great point in going over that for a second time. It was not meant out of discourtesy whatsoever to the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). There was no suggestion that that working party report was not going to look seriously at some of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I made the point in my earlier remarks that the issues involved can be extraordinarily complex. What may appear to be a rather simplistic amendment which, I guess, a lot of people would not find too difficult to live with may have other broader implications. If the Government were to accept that, we would find ourselves in other difficulties. I do not think that any point is served by accepting a piecemeal amendment from the Opposition when there is a working party writing a report and when that working party is in the process of further consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying to the Opposition tonight is that the Government obviously reserves the right to look at this at some time in the future, but we do not want to do so in anticipation of the Attorney-General's review being carried out at present. Even most sensible members of the Opposition would think that to do so would be peculiar. After all, having set up a working party which has as its objective a comprehensive review of age discrimination practices in employment, including compulsory age provisions, obviously the Government is going to look at this. As I have said, we are not by any means dismissive in some sort of cursory way that suggests that we are not conscious of the implications of age. If the honourable member for Pearce were being logical, rather than just using his mock indignation mode that we saw him demonstrating a few minutes ago, he would find unacceptable the suggestion that the Government accept this as an amendment when it currently has under consideration a comprehensive review of the whole notion of age discrimination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a short contribution to this debate. Like the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), I have been in here since 8 p.m. and have listened to the entire duration of the debate. In my short contribution I want to support the remarks of the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and I say to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) in a spirit of genuineness that, if he knew the honourable member for Pearce as I know him, he would know that when he is indignant it is a genuine emotion and certainly does not fall within the realms of mockery. Quite frankly, I say to the Minister that his stance on this 65-year-old age rule is indefensible, and I put it to him that he knows that. In simple terms, in making this Parliament work better, if the Minister does not have the authority, the seniority or the confidence to take these Opposition amendments here and now, from his perspective on the run as it were, the right and proper thing to do in terms of the passage of this legislation is for him to adjourn the debate, go away and seek advice and then come back into this Parliament and deal with these amendments properly; by properly, I suggest that that means accepting them and allowing the Bill to pass as amended. So, in simple terms, my suggestion to the Minister is that he do the right, proper and responsible thing and adjourn the debate and bring it back into the House when he is able to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would serve little purpose if I were to get up and adjourn the debate at this point. The Senate has had a very comprehensive debate on the very same issues that have been raised, and I think the Opposition realises that. The important point that I keep coming back to is that we do have a process in train at present to look at the very issues that the Opposition is raising. Somehow or other I am being accused in some sort of cursory way of being dismissive of the amendments. I have sought to explain to the House that that is far from my intention. We are very conscious of age considerations and it is for that very reason that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) sought to extend this process further. We are conscious of it not just within my portfolio responsibility but right across the broad area of Government responsibility. In that context, we are looking at the total question of age and some of the inconsistencies that I acknowledge are there at present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to take the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) back over a couple of the things that he has said and I hope that he will listen to this in the spirit of acknowledging the case and being prepared to make a decision himself. In his remarks he said that he acknowledged the case that the Opposition has put forward. He then sought, and he has done so on a number of occasions tonight, to hide behind the fact that a working party has been established by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to look at this entire question. It could be that the working party might come up with further restrictions than are presently the case. I am sure that that would be of great concern to all members of the House, particularly this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister should be required to listen to the words he said. He said, `The issues are extremely complex. They may have broader implications', as though accepting that the Opposition's amendments would add to that complexity or further broaden the implications. The simple fact is that there are already Commonwealth instrumentalities that have the provisions that we are seeking; they are already there, so there is no adding to the complexity or broadening of the implications. There is a definite indication of attitude towards people aged over 65 which the Minister, on behalf of the Government, is simply not prepared to acknowledge. If that is the attitude that he wishes to outline and to support, let it be on his own head. He has already acknowledged the case that we have put forward. He has already acknowledged that what we are saying has a great deal of merit; yet the attitude that he is expressing is very much against the acceptance of the capacity of people over the age of 65 to contribute in areas such as this. That is a simple nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are saying here, in line with other existing Commonwealth instrumentalities, is a delineation of attitude towards people aged 65 and above. I admit that it is pretty tough being a Minister and having to make these decisions. I acknowledge that those guys opposite do not like making decisions. But Ministers have been given a pep talk this week and they have to lift their game. We all know that. Why does the Minister not lift his game? It has been suggested in the media that a number of Ministers were invisible. Here is a chance for the Minister to lift that invisibility. He should take it. I am quite serious about this. </PARA>

I am sincerely concerned that there are people within the community who may be over the age of 65 but who have a great deal to offer to an instrumentality such as this. What we are seeking here is not something radical, something extreme, something that will add to complexity or something that will have broader implications. All we are seeking is that this instrumentality have the same opportunities that already exist in other Commonwealth instrumentalities. It has nothing to do with task forces of the Attorney-General. It has nothing to do with those sorts of things. What we want to see here is an attitude expressed by the Government, which obviously will be totally supported by the Opposition, that people aged 65 and above do have a contribution to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister should not hide behind this task force; that is simply what he is doing. Quite frankly, what he has been saying is nonsense. What we are suggesting will not add to the complexity because Commonwealth instrumentalities with this provision already exist. It will not have broader implications because there are already Commonwealth instrumentalities where this provision exists. The Minister cannot argue that with any logical defence of his position. It is simply nonsense. But what we do need within this whole thing, to give an indication to the task force, is an expression of attitude from the Government. That attitude, which we would support strongly, should be that people aged 65 and above do have a contribution to make and should not be restricted from making that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting back to what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sought from all his Minister's, the Minister should lift his game, become less than invisible and make a decision. It will not do him any harm. He will not be adding to the complexity or broadening the implications; on behalf of the Government he will be saying to people aged 65 and above, `Yes, you do have the opportunity to make a contribution'. If he does not do that, he is giving an entirely different signal to people within our community who would like to feel that they still have some contribution to make. </PARA>

I would have thought that, even with a reasonably generous interpretation of my comments, my attitude would have come out reasonably clearly in this debate. I put it to honourable members that over the last few years a number of Bills have come before this Parliament setting up a number of statutory organisations within my portfolio responsibility. I do not have the details in front of me, but I cite a couple of examples: the Australian Sports Commission, which was set up in 1989, and the Australian Institute of Sport, which was set up in 1986. Both of those have age requirements of 65 for board membership and for their chief executive. I may stand corrected, and I am happy to acknowledge a mistake if it has been made, but I am not sure whether, at the time the Bills were moved in those cases, the Opposition moved a similar amendment to negate the retirement age of 65.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not seeking to hide behind the review team that has been developed by the Attorney-General, but I am saying that under most circumstances when we have a review with a process to examine a particular policy it is usual-whether one agrees or disagrees with a particular philosophy or point of principle-to put things on hold. Essentially that is what I am saying to the chamber here tonight. I repeat that I am not being in a cursory way dismissive of the amendment that, I acknowledge, is being sincerely put up by the Opposition. All I am asking for is an act of faith. If the Opposition is prepared to allow the Government to run its course and to look at this whole question of age discrimination, with all its implications, I would think that, given the current climate and the way in which governments and political parties are looking at the aged, it is most unlikely that the scenario that has been painted by Opposition members would develop-that is, that somehow or other we would seek to lower that age from 65 down to a lower age. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Standing order 193 is absolutely clear that it requires two voices to call for a division. We are not debating that at the moment; we have not got to that point. The point of order which has been raised is that, whatever they meant to do-the supine gentlemen opposite-they said nothing. They said nothing and I will not have the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table and who has come in here late, adding untruthfulness to the quality of the conduct of business in this chamber. He said nothing, and it is a farce for him to come in here and say that he voted no. The ruling we are asking from you, Mr Deputy Chairman, concerns whether, in the absence of any call on the Government side and with a clear voting in favour from this side, you have the right as Deputy Chairman to totally ignore the voices and simply make your decision. That is the simple point on which we seek your guidance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr Tuckey</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, I raise a further point of order. You have quoted from one section of the Standing Orders but the simple message, as has been put by the honourable member for Pearce, is that standing order 193 says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>A division shall not be proceeded with unless more than one Member has called for a division. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I make is clear. You cannot have a division if the voices are unanimous. The voices were unanimous because there was only one call. As I said, it is not up to the Opposition to accommodate the ineptness of the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons). If he does not know the Standing Orders and his responsibility to call on the voices, it is not for the Deputy Chairman to sort him out or save him. The fact is that he has lost. He cannot even have a division, because there was no voice for a conflict. There were only voices for one side. All of the sections that talk about two voices make the point that there can be no conflict when there are no voices in conflict. Mr Deputy Chairman, all you can do is report progress. I am disappointed; I want to get into the debate. But the facts of life are that you have had a motion, there was no opposition to the motion and there can be only one ruling. You must rule with the voices. When you have ruled with the voices, that is it. It is too late for them to call a division because there were no voices in opposition to the voices from this side of the chamber. You must do that, and it is your job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to comments by honourable members opposite, one would think that the only way that the view of those on either side can be indicated to the Chair is by an utterance. We all know that on many occasions whoever is in the chair is able to glean from whoever is leading the debate on the other side of the chamber what is the opinion of those on the other side, without any utterance being expressed. It is nonsense to be putting to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, that the only expression of view is that by spoken word. That is not the case. In this case you formed the view that the view of those on this side of the chamber constituted a `no' vote and the matter did not proceed beyond that. You declared your decision based upon your opinion. If somebody wants to call for a division, it is up to that person to call for a division. A division was not called for.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I called him Minister Howe. If you are suggesting that there is something wrong with that, it seems to me that there is a very inconsistent practice here. However, the Minister for Community Services and Health, who is wont at Question Time to deliver lectures to the Opposition on his concerns for the aged and other sections of the community and about the things which we say need fixing, comes in here and votes to exclude people over the age of 65 from participation in employment. That is a very interesting stance, and I noticed quite a lot of honourable members, who I thought had a rather different view about matters of discrimination and age, take the same stance. I am rather surprised that honourable members sitting with the Minister for Community Services and Health would vote against Australians aged 65 and over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the real character of the Labor Party has been demonstrated by this debate, because the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) showed himself incapable of dealing with a straightforward amendment without obfuscation and nonsense and without subjecting the whole matter to a rather long delay. I commend, as an example to this place, the comparable performance of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) who, when a serious matter was raised in the committee stage of another Bill, showed that he had some discretion to act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just draw that matter quietly to your attention, Mr Speaker, but I want to speak on the major point, which is that this Government and this Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), have refused to allow the Opposition amendment, which would allow people over the age of 65 years to take a proper position on this Commonwealth instrumentality. It has already been mentioned that the New South Wales Government is moving to abolish age restrictions, and it is my understanding that the Labor-governed State of South Australia has already this year moved in a similar direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So here we have the Federal Parliament, the Federal Government, the Federal Labor Government, moving in a way which restricts the opportunity of people aged 65 years and over to play a proper and responsible role on a Commonwealth instrumentality. We heard earlier this week from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that his Ministers are not performing up to the mark; he wants them to lift their game. </PARA>

He has demonstrated by his actions tonight that he is simply incapable of making a decision. If the Government and the Minister had acted responsibly, he, if he did not feel capable himself of making a proper decision, should have accepted the Opposition's point of view that the Bill should have been stood over, the debate adjourned and a decision made by the Government on this very important point. The Minister has not done that and the Government has not done that. By his actions the Minister has shown that he is incapable of making a proper decision and the Government has shown by its decision here tonight that its attitude towards people aged 65 years and over leaves a very great deal to be desired.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I well recollect a television program probably five or six years ago when the then Minister, Mr Jones, was telling us all that it was necessary that people be kicked out of work at 55 years of age as the only solution to our unemployment problems. That was a common view at the time. A lot of people in Australia thought that if the old ones were sacked, the young ones could be put into jobs. What has happened in the interim is that we have discovered that when an old person is sacked, no job is created for a new person-a burden is created for the young.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a common practice in this place to put supporting words to one's argument. What I am saying to you, Sir, and to this House--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I am couching my words in those terms. The point I am making to you and to the Parliament and to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who I do not think understands, is that there has been a perceived change in community attitude because the old attitude was absolutely wrong. It has been recognised in the community that people aged 65 years who are fit and willing, and I underline the word `willing', to offer themselves to the community, whether it be in a menial job or as Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into Museums and National Collections, can bring huge experience and other attributes to the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has recognised that in saying that even those persons eligible for an age pension should have the opportunity to continue in employment whatever their vocation and we will reward them with higher pensions at a later date. We made that offer in the national interest. We made it because it is essential for Australia's well-being that people with these skills, abilities and experience be able to serve, whether they operate a lathe or are chairmen of committees. </PARA>
<PARA> We really thought the Government had got that message. It was clearly accepted by the Australian people because the debate is now on, and all of a sudden the Government brings in another piece of legislation to the Parliament and it puts the 1978-80 model of `kick them out when they are 65' into the legislation. Parliament is about getting the best result. Today the Government has demonstrated a very high degree of ineptness in handling this debate, as you may be aware, Mr Speaker-very inept-and it has got it wrong. If it wants to have a better image in the community, it has the simple solution of saying, `We got it wrong'. </PARA>
<PARA> If an Opposition of whatever political colour cannot stand up in this place and say to the Government, `Here is a simple example of something you have got wrong', and if it cannot be resolved in this place because the Minister has not got his marching orders, he does not know who to run to to ask, `What do I do now?'--</PARA>

But if he does not know, do not blame the Parliament for that. The Government will get its act cranked up in the next three or four days and, when the legislation gets to the Senate, the Government will come up with its amendment and then bring it down here. Of course, if it gets a bit delayed in the Senate--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister tells me with a grin, `It has been through the Senate'. What does that mean? The Minister does not intend to do anything about it-nothing. The Minister has just told me, `Age 65 and you are out'. That is what the Minister is telling me, and if he had any brains he would realise that this was his last chance to overcome this silly mistake. It is not earth shattering, it is just wrong. The Minister is bringing it about because the legislation has been through the Senate. I thought at least we might have the Senate correct it and, if we were lucky, Parliament would not have to be recalled some time around 24 December at huge expense; but the Minister tells me that is not on and he is pleased about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister wonders why his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has to tell him to get his act together. The Minister wonders why! I do not know what goes on in the Minister's Department, but if it is run with the competence that was demonstrated here tonight in one of the fundamental aspects of the parliamentary system, namely, the handling of a division, no wonder we get this sort of crummy legislation turning up in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government can push the legislation down the throats of the people of Australia, using what is apparently its majority of three tonight in winning this vote. The Minister can do that if he honestly believes and is absolutely committed to throwing people out when they are 65 years of age. This is not about one clause in the Government's Bill. This is about a fundamental issue of whether the Government throws people on the scrap heap at 65 years of age. It is a manifestation of treating people at 65 years as non-citizens. The Opposition has stood up as friendly as you like and said, `We draw this problem to your attention, Minister; do something about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister does not know how-that is the problem. It is not that he would not like to; he just does not know how. I did say something about being as thick as a plank. I do not want to refer to the Minister specifically because there are too many like him. The reality is that that is what he is saying. That is what he is doing. It is his last chance-he has just admitted to that-because it has been through the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I repeat that this is an important fundamental issue. The Government has done the wrong thing in bringing forward this legislation because people have changed their minds. They want old people to be given the opportunity to do what they are able and willing to do if they have the skills. Age discrimination is as rotten as any other form of discrimination. It is not necessary. What are Government members fighting about? I will tell them what they are fighting about. They just do not know what to do. They are hopeless. If they keep it up, God save Australia. The Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, cannot handle a simple little matter like this and apparently has no authority. He is a Minister of the Crown, he has taken an oath, but in this House he has no authority because he is not trusted sufficiently to be let off the leash to make a decision of this nature. </PARA>

Unfortunately the Government will apparently vote for that because its Minister is leading it, as others are, on a path of disaster. He does not know how to get out of it and the Leader of the House does not know how to help him. In a moment we will have a vote on the matter. Everybody on the Government side will come in here and vote 65 and you are out. I am glad that Opposition members will not do that; I certainly will not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I find this debate absolutely amazing. The debate has been about a very important piece of legislation, the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill, to establish the Australian Maritime Museum. For some reason, we have turned it into some sort of theatrical event. It has been very entertaining. Opposition members have had a few laughs at the cheap jibes of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). But, quite frankly, it does not worry me and I do not think it worries too many other Government members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members have failed to accept in this whole debate the fact that the Government has addressed this question of age discrimination. It is not as though the Opposition has suddenly discovered problems about age discrimination. Last year the then Attorney-General had a look at the question of age discrimination with a view to undertaking a wide ranging review. In my remarks tonight I indicated that this process is drawing to a conclusion. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) plans to produce a discussion paper, as I said in my remarks earlier tonight, within the next three months, in which people will obviously have an opportunity to comment further on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would welcome-I say this seriously to the Opposition-the contribution of those opposite because, as I said earlier tonight, it seems to be a new found interest in the Opposition. This matter did not worry those opposite when a couple of other authorities were established in the last couple of years. But it seems to worry them now. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said on countless occasions tonight, it is not as though the Government is in some sort of cursory way dismissing this issue, as the Opposition is suggesting that we are doing; that when a person turns 65 he or she is `over and out'-to use the phrase that I think the honourable member for O'Connor used. We are saying that we have established a review process. Most people in public administration, and I am sure in private administration, would say that when a review process is established the status quo remains. We look at where we are at present, we undertake the review and we allow people to be consulted. As I said earlier in the debate tonight, if, on the basis of the review process that the Attorney-General is undertaking-not just for my Department but right across a whole range of government departments-a recommendation is put that this be wiped, I will be more than happy to come into this House and move an amendment to the Australian National Maritime Museum Bill along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am suggesting at this stage is that this is really just a big act for some sort of cheap political stunt by the Opposition. Quite frankly, in a few weeks time the Opposition will complain that because the Government wants to get on with the business of other legislation somehow it is truncating debate when for the last hour or so tonight we have had this charade, when honourable members opposite have gone on with the sort of nonsense that we have heard in the comments from the honourable member for O'Connor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise because on behalf, I think, of members on both side of this House I want to pay a tribute to the life of Clifton Pugh, one of Australia's great artists, who died recently. He was well known in Victoria and a man of great skill. Many authorities regard him as probably one of Australia's greatest ever portrait painters. His perceptions and his landscapes have given us all a new perception and a new concept of the Australian bush which he loved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pugh was born in Richmond, joined the Army when he was 19, served with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in New Guinea and Japan and when he came back he commenced his training at the Australian National Gallery. In the early fifties he commenced building his mud brick home at Cottlesbridge near Eltham and over a period of years added very substantially to that house so that it could be not merely a place where he lived but a gallery of some significance in its own right and a centre for artistic and social discourse to which he invited not merely members of the arts communities, but members of political parties, people who came to see his work and enjoyed his company. </PARA>
<PARA> A three times Archibald Prize winner, Clifton Pugh has been acclaimed by many critics for the quality and the perception of his portraits. If one looks at the list of famous Australians that he painted one sees that it includes Gough Whitlam, Archbishop Mannix, Sir John Kerr, Neville Wran and many other prominent Australians from all walks of life. Many people regard his portraits as probably the most important part of his work. The war museum has already obtained from Pugh a number of major works following its commissioning of him as part of the 75th anniversary commemoration at Anzac Cove. </PARA>
<PARA> As a committed conservationist he did not spare himself in the range of campaigns in which he involved himself and much of his work was related to the preservation of the Australian environment. In my party, the Australian Labor Party, he played a major part in formulating ALP arts policy both at a State and a Federal level. Many of those initiatives were, in fact, put into legislation during the early years of the Whitlam Government. He can take some real credit for the formulation of the Australia Council, on which he served. </PARA>
<PARA> Before he died it was typical of the man that he bequeathed his home on some 15 hectares of parkland in trust for the people of Victoria to serve as a centre which will go on stimulating young Australian artists as he himself did in his own lifetime. He will be missed, I believe, by all who knew and loved him, but his work will live on and be honoured, as it is in this Parliament House, as it is in our national and State galleries and in private collections. Through that work he will continue to remind us of our heritage, of the unique beauty of this ancient landscape in this island continent which he loved and which he has recorded for posterity. He will be sadly missed and I am pleased to have been a friend. I am pleased to be able to place on record in this Parliament the great contribution he has made to the life of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent weeks many of us on this side of the House have attended and addressed rural crisis meetings across the nation. From what I have heard in this place this evening it is not the only crisis that we have in our political processes. Despite what the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) have said at various times, let there be no doubt about it-there is a crisis. People out there are hurting and provincial centres are suffering. However, the magnitude of the crisis is yet to be recognised by this Government and remedial initiatives, both short and long term, have yet to be implemented. The high interest rate, high tax, high inflation, high dollar and increasing unemployment environment in which small business in general, and the rural sector in particular, find themselves has manifested itself in various ways. Tonight I would like to raise just one aspect of the problem put to me in a recent letter from the United Graziers' Association of Queensland:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government has decided to increase the tax on Australia's livestock industries to recoup 100 per cent of the cost of abattoir inspection services. The industry currently pays 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision will result in an average increase of 48% in the charge, and is scheduled to apply from 1 January 1991. It will increase the industry's annual costs by ($39 million in 1991/92). </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The sheep and cattle industries will bear the brunt of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need to explain the dire circumstances facing Australia's sheep industry. The cattle industry is also experiencing depressed returns and faces fierce competition in export markets. It is vital that the Australian beef industry minimise costs if it is to take advantage of export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Our opposition to the decision falls into three categories. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it represents a reversal of the policy stated by the Government in May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> In a statement issued at that time titled ``Primary Industries and Resources: Policies for Growth'', the Minister stated. </PARA>
<PARA> ``In recognition of the national benefit attained through inspection of both export and domestic products the Government will continue to meet a proportion of the costs''. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask that the Government honour the letter and spirit of this policy by maintaining at least its current contribution of 40% of the cost base. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the industry is being forced to pay not only for the direct on site costs of inspection, but also the full on-costs associated with regional offices, head office and overseas offices. We believe the industry should not have to bear the full costs of the bureaucracy supporting the on site inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, as the major financier of the services, the industry has a right to ensure that the service is run as efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the Government should enter into consultation with industry to establish appropriate management arrangements which recognise industry as the major financier. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has imposed this increased tax without consultation with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>This is but one example of a wider problem and it begs two questions of the Government: firstly, how wide is the lack of consultation with peak bodies in the rural sector and, secondly, when will it finally admit the error of its ways and take its head out of the sand in its preoccupation with monetary policy regurgitated in this place again today by the Treasurer? Farmers do not want handouts; they simply seek a day's pay for a day's work and some non-recurring governmental initiatives to get them out of a hole which is of the Government's making. There is a way ahead but it will take lateral thinking and political and economic guts to get us through it-attributes which I regret do not spring to mind immediately when we consider the track records of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, in particular. People want action, not just pointless rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to follow on from the previous speech made by my colleague the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), particularly with regard to the situation in rural parts of north-central Victoria and especially in the Bendigo electorate, and the sorts of decisions that many families are going to have to make in the very near future. One of those, of course, relates to the future of their children and their educational requirements, and the problems that they are experiencing with the Government's Austudy program. They are coming to that critical period when they will have to consider what tertiary institutions their children might attend, and in fact take into consideration the level of assets testing that the Government has introduced in this year's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, many of these families live on properties which could be worth more than $200,000 and, whilst in one respect they have some substantial assets, they have very little income-particularly in my electorate where many of them are wool and wheat producers. As honourable members of this House would understand, things are very difficult in both of those areas at the moment, with lower prices and a lack of support for both of those commodities. Many of the families in my electorate are concerned about the difficult decision which they have to make in respect of tertiary study for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> I had one case brought to my attention during last week where a young man and his wife, with their four children who are all the same age-they are quads-share farm a property with the father and the property is probably worth in excess of $200,000. Of course, the family allowance now has restricted access for families and for children if their assets exceed the magical figure of $200,000. This young family will face that problem. They are wool and wheat producers; they have a low income; they are in a very tight and difficult situation; and yet they cannot in fact claim the family allowance, purely and simply based on that assets test. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring these issues to the House because they are very real, and they are issues which the Government-particularly the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-does not understand. I think it is about time that the Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the respective Ministers of the Hawke Government got out into country areas and found out exactly what is happening and the sort of pressure that people in rural areas of Australia are experiencing right at this very moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) have spoken about the rural crisis, and there is a bit of a contradiction in what they were saying. The honourable member for Groom said that country people do not want handouts-which is an unkind term-in the way of assistance to the disadvantaged; and the honourable member for Bendigo said that he wants the disadvantaged in country areas to be helped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we need to get into perspective what is happening in the rural areas. The real crisis is not right through country areas; it is in the wool industry and it is principally because of our inability to obtain markets overseas. We need to recognise where the problem lies because we are in danger of creating fears in country areas-fears that are totally unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that consultation has been very high with farmer groups, and I disagree with the honourable member for Groom when he says that there has been a lack of consultation. There have been extensive consultations, particularly with the National Farmers Federation and some of the constituent organisations of the NFF, but I would say that the New South Wales Farmers' Association-which has a de facto relationship with the National Party-has been less than cooperative in talking to the Government about constructive ways in which we can deal with the rural crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Farmers Association is great at accusing this Government and the Australian Labor Party of having a marriage with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Well, at least it is a marriage. I suggest that the New South Wales Farmers Association formalise its arrangements with the National Party and declare itself as an arm of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It ought to be recognised that there are many positives for our rural industries. There are potential markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. With improved economies in all those areas we are going to see good markets and we need to be ready for that. Our rural farm sector-a highly efficient farm sector-is in a good position to take full advantage of those markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point which we ought to be aware of is that there is going to be less arable land in the world. With strong action by environmental movements throughout the world and increased environmental consciousness, the need for countries to ensure that land is not over-farmed is going to mean that countries like Australia are going to obtain an advantage. We will get extra sales from that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in Australia we are going to be able to add value more than ever to our products. This is because of work done by people like the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Alan Griffiths). In fact, the latter Minister and his predecessor, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), have ensured that four studies into the timber industry will pave the way for adding value so that we can reverse some of that $1.6m deficit due to the importing of timber products into Australia. Those four studies will mean that we are going to be able to process timber to a much greater extent than in the past through recovery mills, pulp mills and plantations in Australia-a far better way than exporting raw wood chips overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> There is great hope for our farming sector. I look forward to an improvement in the farm position. I recognise the problems in the wool industry and believe that both State and Federal governments, through the rural adjustment scheme, will be able to cope with those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the significant problems that have become evident during International Literacy Year is illiteracy in the Australian work force. Although I concede that the extent of this problem is difficult to measure, there are estimates floating around that suggest that Australia is losing $3 billion per annum in lost productivity through low literacy levels amongst Australian workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important question, I believe, for us to address in this House is: Why has this occurred? When we talk about literacy problems in the workplace we are not talking only about migrant workers-they, of course, have some special problems. We are talking about a significant number of members of the Australian work force who are actually born in Australia and who have this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Who do we blame? Of course, there is a tendency in some respects to say that the school system is responsible and that it is just not producing literate students. Certainly, there are plenty of employers around who would say that the young people that come to them for jobs are, in many respects, functionally illiterate-they may not able to spell, they may not be able to read and they may not be able to add up. That, also, is evident from talking to academics-people who teach at technical and further education colleges and universities-who also say that in a lot of respects the kids that come to them are illiterate to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not necessarily solve the problem when we realise that 70 per cent of the Australian work force in the year 2000 has already left school. Therefore, it becomes a very real problem for the Australian community which asks, `How are we going to address this problem for people who are in the work force now and who will still be in the work force and forming an important part of it in the year 2000?'. Of course, the big question is who is going to pay to redress the problem-and a problem it is. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy, I suppose, to expect that employers will foot the bill to redress the problem. There is no doubt that for employers there are certainly benefits in having more literate employees, not the least of which, I suppose, is the whole question of safety in the work place. It is quite evident that workers who are unable to read instructions or to understand signs that warn them about dangers are not only a danger to themselves, but also to others. The fact is that if they are injured in the work place through being unable to understand or comprehend instructions, the compensation costs resulting from the down time that occurs because of the injury involved are very significant for the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> In other respects, the employer has an interest in improving literacy skills because this will lead, quite directly, to improved productivity, better quality and a number of other benefits that are quite obvious for employers in having more literate employees. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that most employers would shrink from accepting some responsibility in their own interests for going about improving the literacy skills of their work force. The question that many employers ask, I think quite correctly, is whether these workers, in many respects, have been thrust on them by the education system that we have in this country and whether, therefore, the Australian community has some responsibility for fixing the problem. I believe that it is a very fair approach in looking at this problem to see it as a shared responsibility of this Government, State governments, to some extent, and employers to redress the very serious deficiency that exists in literacy skills in the Australian workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not going to indulge at any time in teacher bashing. I believe that teachers are very important members of the Australian community. I see the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), is in the House and agrees with me on that. But there are certainly serious questions being asked-and I think they need to be considered as serious questions-about the way that reading, for instance, is taught in schools. There are those who say that we are not going about teaching young people to read correctly. Ultimately, we are not able to tell whether they are being taught to read correctly--</PARA>
