<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989.

The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt homeopaths and herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries.

<TITLE>Medicare Office: Mareeba, Queensland</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the following situation:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of a Medicare Office in the township of Mareeba, on the Atherton Tableland of North Queensland, is causing extreme hardship to pensioners and other low income earners, who are obliged by circumstances of extremely limited and unsuitable public transport facilities to lodge Medicare claim forms by post with either the Atherton or Cairns Medicare Offices. From experience, these Offices are taking up to four weeks to process the claim forms and return payments.</PARA>
<PARA> Such waiting periods are unacceptable to claimants who have large claims outstanding when they are in a financial position where they can least afford to wait for payment. Currently there is no Doctor/Practice in Mareeba which totally bulk bills patients.</PARA>
<PARA> Such an Office would also better service the surrounding gulf and outback areas, a great benefit to those rural citizens. Mareeba is the main administrative centre of the northern Tablelands area and with an ever increasing aged population residing in this part of North Queensland, it is considered essential that a Medicare Office be established here.</PARA>
<PARA> We petitioners, therefore, respectfully request that the House take action to ensure a Medicare office is situated in Mareeba as soon as possible to alleviate these problems. Failing this, a visiting service similar to that which operates with the Department of Social Security would be greatly welcomed.</PARA>

<PARA> That the House take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report I have just tabled, Our Future, Our Selves, is the final report of the inquiry into support services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In the last Parliament the Committee tabled an interim report on the inquiry indicating that the inquiry would be divided into four areas. That was followed up by the report A Chance For The Future which contained the Committee's conclusions and recommendations on the education and training aspects of the inquiry. This report deals with self-determination and self-management and impediments to their further development. It also deals with funding, coordination, accountability and resources to allow greater self-determination and self-management. </PARA>
<PARA> Other members who participated in the previous Parliament will speak in more detail on this report, but I want to say a few things briefly in relation to the all-important question of this report's recommendations in relation to the difference between consultation and negotiation. The report recommends that we should start thinking about the way in which we deal with Aboriginal communities in a very different framework. </PARA>
<PARA> The report deals with the existing process of consultation in chapter 4 and notes at 4.24 the way in which Aboriginal communities regard the existing consultation processes. The report notes that Aboriginal perceptions are very different from those of government. Almost invariably they reflected dissatisfaction. When the subject was raised by the Committee during informal discussions, Aboriginal communities were repeatedly dismissive and sometimes even derisive about attempts at consultation by all levels of government as their previous experience had led them to believe that it would achieve very little. There was a strong perception that whatever consultation occurred was inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> For some communities, after years of having decisions taken for them by outsiders, to be suddenly allowed to be involved in matters affecting the community was a novel experience and was viewed with some surprise and scepticism. Aboriginal people may have been involved in the decisions but they still felt the decisions were being taken far away. There was also criticism of the way in which government departments were essentially using the rhetoric of consultation as a screen to justify what was in effect ratification of decisions which had already been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are some communication difficulties with respect to processes of consultation and the Committee addressed that matter, noting, for example, the need to develop a much more widespread use of plain English in communication, documentation and correspondence with Aboriginal communities. But more substantially the report recommends that our thinking about the concept of discussion with Aboriginal communities should be framed in terms of negotiation rather than consultation. In that process there is a need to change the emphasis in the process from one of listening to and advising communities to one where communities have a more direct say in deciding final outcomes. Instead of being merely involved, Aboriginal people must be integral to deciding policy and programs which directly affect their lives. That is essentially the difference between consultation and negotiation as explained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> The work for this report was largely undertaken by the Committee in the previous Parliament under the chairmanship of Allen Blanchard and, later, under the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). To enable the Committee to take advantage of the experience of the previous members we appointed a subcommittee of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, as Chairman, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), all members of the previous Committee, to complete the report. The honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable member for Leichhardt agreed to be additional members of the Committee for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee as a whole takes responsibility for the content of the report, we should acknowledge the substantial authorship of the subcommittee. On behalf of the Committee I would like to thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory in particular for the considerable effort he put into the preparation of the report and for chairing the subcommittee in this Parliament. I also thank the other members of the subcommittee, the full Committee and the secretariat for their efforts to complete this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I wish to thank my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for his kind words in his introduction to the tabling of this report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. At the outset I would like to thank a number of people who have made a great contribution to this Committee but who are, for one reason or another, no longer on it. The first is Allen Blanchard, who was Chairman prior to my period as Chairman of that Committee. Allen is no longer a member of the House but his efforts in the area of Aboriginal affairs and his efforts on this Committee in particular have not gone unnoticed. I believe that he is one person who, having left the Parliament, can say that he did indeed make a contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to acknowledge my friends and colleagues the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), both of whom served on the Committee in the previous Parliament and both of whom were members of the subcommittee which finalised this report. They were kind enough to stay on as members of the Committee to see that this report was completed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to acknowledge the work of David Elder, who is no longer the Secretary of the Committee but who was Secretary for a number of years. His advice and assistance with regard to the operation of the Committee and in the preparation of documents were without peer in terms of my experience in this Parliament. Peter Stephens and Auriel Bloomfield were also instrumental in the writing of the initial drafts of this report. Peter and Auriel are no longer with the Committee. On behalf of the Committee I would like to acknowledge their work and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, but by no means least, I would like to acknowledge members of the current Committee for their forbearance in being able to go through this very lengthy document on the basis that they got a nod and wink from the honourable member for Leichhardt, the honourable member for Macquarie and me about its appropriateness. I must say that they did that rather well. We were able to negotiate any issues that may have been contentious without any great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to acknowledge Allan Kelly and the current secretariat for having to take on a report which, although drafted in the first instance, was not completed. They had the difficult task of amending drafts of a report that they had not been involved in and they have done it extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA> The two reports of this Committee make it starkly obvious that there has been insufficient effort in marrying the Government's policies of Aboriginal self-determination and self-management with appropriate planning and management mechanisms to ensure that Aboriginal and Islander people have the means to control their lives. It is apparent that the consultation process has been largely ineffective. It has not been a process of which dialogue has been a feature; rather, it has been one in which, after discussions of varying lengths, views from outside have been imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the consultation process should be based on negotiation when government and other agencies deal with Aboriginal and Islander people. Negotiation is necessary if meaning is to be given to self-determination. The distinction between the terms `self-determination' and `self-management' is important. On the one hand, self-management focuses on efficient administration of communities and organisations. Self-determination, on the other hand, goes well beyond this and implies control over policy and decision- making, especially the determination of structures, processes and priorities. The differences between the two concepts often provide a dilemma for government agencies. Indeed, if an Aboriginal organisation encounters problems pressure is placed on government officials to intervene in this self-management process and rectify matters. By doing this, however, Aboriginal people may end up sacrificing self-determination as control of their affairs is transferred out of their hands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee examined a number of impediments to self-determination and self-management. The concept of community, for example, as it applies to Aboriginal structures is not always clear and often fails to recognise the differing factions, groups and interests in communities. There is often a conflict between Aboriginal cultural obligations and the political or administrative requirements of community management. Non-Aboriginal structures are often seen as being unrepresentative and lacking in authority by Aboriginal people. At the same time Aboriginal organisations lack authority in the non-Aboriginal power structures. The resources and skills provided to Aboriginal communities to enable them effectively to manage themselves have thus far been inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> A central recommendation of this Committee resulted in the Government's acknowledgment that to give effect to policies of self-determination and self-management it is necessary to reappraise the effectiveness of existing structures and methods of dealing with Aboriginal and Islander people and that such a reappraisal should, firstly, acknowledge that the process of consultation has generally not given rise to genuine dialogue and has been largely ineffective; and, secondly, accept the need for policies and outcomes to be determined by a process of negotiation which better accords with traditional decision making processes. The Committee further recommended that the process of negotiation with Aboriginal people should replace the current process of consultation, and that, when negotiating structures, governments should avoid placing undue pressure on Aboriginal people in such a way as to achieve an outcome that would conform to established government policy or meet a government imposed timetable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made a number of more detailed recommendations on general principles to be observed when establishing structures for Aboriginal people and for discussions and negotiations with Aboriginal people. I do not have time this morning to go through the whole gamut of the recommendations in this document, but I will, if I may, just alert the House to the major headings which the recommendations address. They address concerns relating to women in Aboriginal communities and coordination of the administration of Aboriginal affairs in terms of policies from State and Territory governments. A very interesting and important recommendation of this Committee, and one about which we had some discussion with the current shadow Minister, was on the coordination and role of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in dealing with the coordination of Aboriginal programs. Recommendation 17 of this report recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA>As the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission develops its structures and administrative capacities, Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments view the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as the co-ordinating agency for working with Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important recommendation. It goes to a number of things which this Government has been addressing over the last short period, particularly in relation to looking at aspects of public administration in terms of micro-economic reform. There is absolutely no point, in my view, in the stupid duplication of services that currently exists in the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country. Some commentators outside this place have taken the view that ATSIC ought to be white-anted and that indeed it should not be seen as the main carrier of Aboriginal affairs administration in this country. They have adopted the view that it is an undemocratic organisation which does not represent Aboriginal interests. In fact, the Northern Territory Chief Minister has asserted that it is against the interests of the wider community. That, of course, is arrant nonsense. There was enough debate in this Parliament and there were enough amendments to this legislation to ensure that it accords with the majority view. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am happy to say that this Committee has always operated in a bipartisan manner. It is a great credit to this Committee that on an issue which has caused great division in this House over the past couple of years its reports have invariably been brought down with bipartisan support. It is a credit not only to the members of the Government but also to the Opposition. In this particular instance I must say that on these issues the shadow Minister has shown himself prepared to examine the issues with a great deal of objectivity. That is the course that we ought to follow when we are addressing Aboriginal issues generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It also accords with a recent address to the United Nations in Geneva by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner). He was addressing the issue of reconciliation. In that context he said that a precondition of any reconciliation must be the adoption of a national goal for all levels of government working with Aboriginal people to address cooperatively issues of land, housing, health, infrastructure, education, employment and economic development of Aboriginal Australia in the period leading up to the centenary of federation in 2001. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that it has to happen a lot sooner than that. This report addresses some of the key issues in getting that coordination and cooperation together. It addresses a whole range of other issues which I do not have time to address this morning. One of them is the issue of community development. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the problems we have had in the area of Aboriginal affairs in this country, certainly since the mid-1970s, is that in terms of giving back to people control over their affairs, we have been all too short in insisting that when we do that, they do what we say. That is no longer good enough. ATSIC sets up the framework whereby Aboriginal people can have a proper say in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. More importantly, in the area of community development we ought to be considering appropriate community development planning.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in speaking to the tabling of this report I would first like to thank the staff of the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs for the very hard work they have done, particularly in recent weeks. Other than the members of the Committee, very few people see just how hard those people work. I should say also that I came to this Committee only at the commencement of this Parliament, after the very hard work that was done by the Committee of the previous Parliament. So, coming late to this Committee, I will speak for only a few moments. I acknowledge that this report is largely the work of others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many ways, this report is an indictment of the way successive State and Federal governments have developed a patchwork quilt to try to deal with problems in Aboriginal affairs. I have been very concerned to read the reports of the work that the Committee did around the country during the life of the last Parliament and to read some of the conclusions that were reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous two speakers, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), talked about consultation and negotiation. The two areas of this report that concern me the most are those of coordination and funding. Ultimately, if government cannot get its act together on coordination and funding, it can have very little credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 6 of the report deals with coordination. The Committee makes some observations that are worthy of mention in this Parliament. Aboriginal communities may have to deal with up to 18 different State and Commonwealth government bodies when trying to coordinate the different programs in their communities. This would be a gargantuan task for any group. For a group of people who are only now having full access to education and for many of whom English may be a second or foreign language, this becomes a burden that really is something that has not been properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA> What is even more disturbing is that when the Committee looked at the reasons for the ineffective coordination, it appeared that this was a result of there being a plethora of agencies involved in service delivery which resulted in overlap, duplication and wastage. There was poor communication within and between agencies. There was rivalry and hostility. Because of the differing structures in differing agencies, the bureaucratic mechanism could not communicate between one level and another. There was a lack of overall coordination between States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA> The point was made to the Committee, and it is restated in the report, that this proliferation of agencies, policies and programs in Aboriginal communities leads to duplication, high administrative costs, lack of efficiency in program delivery and an increasing territorial rivalry. In the five months that I have travelled around the country since I became shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I have seen the very real need that exists in Aboriginal communities. I am intensely annoyed that when this need exists, so much of our resources goes on duplication, rivalry and wastage. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 7 deals with funding. Again, it is an indictment of the way that successive State and Territory governments have put patchwork programs together without any overall coordination. It was put to the Committee by the South Australian Government that this lack of coordination led to fragmented policy development and planning and unnecessary financial arrangements. These are all the consequences of the way we do things. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems were most notable in the community of Toomelah in New South Wales. I visited that community two weeks ago. Some time ago the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission reported on the conditions at Toomelah. The appalling conditions in that community were largely attributable to conflict over appropriate policy and respective funding responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the State. Quite frankly, different levels of government had let the people down. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it was put to the Committee by the Auditor-General that because of the duplication of funding sources, existing projects were assessed not on an ongoing basis or against their initial justification, and any new projects could not get up on their merits. Quite simply, the current situation of duplication and wastage is failing Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to this report late, I may differ in emphasis from some of the recommendations that have been placed, but the report has gone through as it has because I felt it would have been unreasonably pedantic to try to dot every i and cross every t. The way that people had worked in the previous Parliament and the sense that we wanted to get a report that largely reflected the views across the parties are reasons why I have not been pedantic about this report. I may differ in my assessment of ATSIC from the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In my view, certainly ATSIC is now on notice but, if it can get its act and accountability in order, we will have to look at it in the light of that. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is an important contribution to the debate on Aboriginal affairs and I hope that the Government will take it a little more seriously than it has taken the previous reports of this Committee. This is the seventh report in nearly seven years-since November 1984. The Committee has yet to receive a single reply from the Government. People put a lot of work into these committees, and if they want to feel that working for common ground means anything it is important that they get a response from the Government as to what the value of their work is. I commend the report to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) would like to have been here today as he worked so hard on this report. Unfortunately he is overseas and, therefore, as another new member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, it falls to me to have an opportunity to speak. I am not an expert in the area and I was not involved in taking the evidence or writing the report but, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has said, I did get fairly heavily involved in some of the reviewing and redrafting and so I have some knowledge, obviously, of what is there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that many members of this House will have heard on a number of occasions before the sorts of issues that are raised in this report. It is perhaps not to our credit as a country that such fundamental problems have not been adequately resolved before. I would like to pay tribute to those who worked so hard on this Committee and also to the staff who worked so ably with them. The Chairman, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who spoke initially, the honourable member for the Northern Territory and the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) have dealt with the main provisions. I would like to cover just a few of the truths that particularly struck me when I was reviewing the report and its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, of course, we place great emphasis on a bipartisan approach, and I think that is right, but we also need to be aware that Aboriginals themselves do not always see a bipartisan approach as necessarily positive. In fact, a number of them regard it with suspicion and see it as collusion by the non-Aboriginal community, and that is often a view that is expressed. Aboriginal problems, of course, vary from area to area by geography, by custom and by history and, therefore, we cannot say there are any blanket solutions to many of the problems that have been identified. What is quite clear is that imposed solutions will not work. We need ideas percolating upwards from the Aboriginal communities, but I believe the overwhelming need is for continuity and certainty in funding and in programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Frequently we and our constituents in dealing with the bureaucracy around the country become confused and cannot handle it. For Aboriginals it is much worse because the very structures that we have imposed are totally alien to their culture. Therefore, training and involvement of Aboriginals is important, but of critical importance, I suggest, is the training of the non-Aboriginal people who are going to work with the Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say a special word about Aboriginal women. I quote an extract from the report which I think is most important:</PARA>
<PARA> A recent Queensland Health Department report shows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women are 17 times more likely to die from diabetes than white women in Australia. They are 13 times more likely to die from pneumonia, 9 times more likely to die of cervical cancer and 7 times more likely to die from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma. Many women are still being removed from communities weeks before childbirth. They and their families often do not have suitable accommodation near the hospital. Giving birth in a non-Aboriginal environment with males present disrupts traditional practices and often leaves the woman with little or no personal support. </PARA>
<PARA> Women and children are frequently the victims of domestic violence stimulated by alcohol. A recent report shows that one in four deaths of women in Alice Springs town camps resulted from alcohol related violence. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that encapsulates the plight of many Aboriginal women in remote communities. If anything, the report understates its evidence about women and its recommendations are a minimal position. I commend the report to the House and I urge the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) to pursue its recommendations with alacrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I pay tribute to the effort of all the members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, including Opposition members, who worked in a bipartisan way to produce what I believe is a comprehensive and well directed report entitled Our Future, Our Selves. I also endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) in asking the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) to be positive in his approach and response to the report, because I believe that some of the short term difficulties that exist in Aboriginal and Islander communities are addressed in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One important area dealt with by the Committee relates to the range of structures available for the incorporation of Aboriginal organisations. The Commonwealth policy of direct funding of organisations has seen-maybe for better, maybe for worse-a wide range of Aboriginal organisations incorporated. In Queensland and the Northern Territory there are forms of local government for Aboriginal community councils. These councils have access to local government Commonwealth Grants Commission funding. Elsewhere in Australia, community councils and other organisations are incorporated under association Acts. However, Commonwealth legislation is available for both Aboriginal community councils and other Aboriginal organisations. A particular difficulty for community councils set up under association Acts is the lack of adequate powers over such matters as land and the oft quoted problem of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the difficulties in my State of Queensland. In Queensland the model for community management of former missions and government reserves takes two forms: firstly, communities constituted under the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1975, that is, only Aurukun and Mornington Island; and, secondly, communities which have been constituted under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 and the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984. That includes some 18 Torres Strait islands and 14 mainland Aboriginal communities in receipt of local government Grants Commission funding. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a number of other Aboriginal organisations involved with self-management have used other State or Commonwealth mechanisms to incorporate as associations. For example, there are some 125 bodies incorporated under the Commonwealth's Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s the Queensland Government implemented the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act and established Aurukun and Mornington Island as local government authorities, conferring upon them all the functions, powers, duties and obligations of any other local government authority in Queensland. This step was taken to thwart Commonwealth intervention in the two communities following the withdrawal of the Uniting Church. </PARA>
<PARA> After that, the previous Queensland Government enacted further legislation in relation to the control and management of land set aside for Aboriginal people through the community services legislation. The community councils established under this legislation are broadly similar in function to those created under the Local Government Act, although the legislation also provides for land to be transferred in perpetuity to the elected Aboriginal and Islander councils by way of a deed of grant in trust. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the detail of the two types of legislation varies, the theory and practical impact of both statutes at a community level is similar. One of the Committee's advisers noted at a seminar held in Brisbane that the community services legislation was an attempt to construct another form of local government that was equivalent in status to mainstream local government. I quote the adviser:</PARA>
<PARA> Both Acts seem to me to be in theory versions of a conventional local government model--</PARA>

<PARA> (2) recognising that concern regarding inequality is shared by all major political parties in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) noting that the most recently published survey on the distribution and composition of personal wealth in Australia, Dilnot Australian Economic Review-lst quarter 1990, has concluded that over half the total personal wealth in Australia is held by the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population and the effective tax rate on income from savings falls as wealth rises; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) sharing the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in his maiden speech to the House-</PARA>
<PARA>this House calls on the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) collect and publish national statistical information regarding the distribution of wealth in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) commission a study to give detailed consideration to, and to report upon, measures available to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an old saying which goes that the best way to judge even the most affluent society is by how well it treats its poor. I rise today to bring to the attention of the House how little we know about the distribution of wealth in this country. By not knowing about wealth we run the very real risk of misapplying aid that goes to our less fortunate citizens. The most recent analysis of wealth was by A. W. Dilnot writing as Downing Fellow at the University of Melbourne and published in the Australian Economic Review, first quarter, 1990. Dilnot made the point that very little is known of wealth distribution in Australia, especially at the most wealthy end. Dilnot's sentiments echoed those of John Pigott writing in the same journal, third quarter, 1988, in an article called `The Distribution of Wealth-What is it, What Does it Mean and is it Important?'. Pigott states:</PARA>
<PARA> No comprehensive survey data on personal wealth holdings have been collected since the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>Pigott poses the question: Is the distribution of wealth important? I contend that it is of vital significance to all of us who are concerned about inequality in Australia. A recent Economic Planning Advisory Council discussion paper showed up an existing inequality when it estimated that household wealth net of debt increased dramatically between 1983 and 1990, from the equivalent of 3.2 times gross private income to nearly 4.5 times. That is a laudable increase except for the fact that the increase largely rested on a rapid rise in house values, especially in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Who benefited from this dramatic increase? It is obvious from Dilnot's analysis who did not benefit. Some 30 per cent of the Australian population have no wealth at all; so any increase in wealth just serves to widen the gap between the haves and have nots. The rich just get richer. </PARA>
<PARA> Dilnot's analysis shows that the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population hold 55.2 per cent of Australia's private wealth. This concentration begs the question: What effect does so much wealth have in so few hands? Recent examples of how several of Australia's more wealthy businessmen have conducted their business affairs would lead to the conclusion that the concentration of wealth in a few hands can lead to major damage being done, not only to our economy but also to our international prestige. </PARA>
<PARA> Wealth gives its holders opportunities and economic power that the less well off in our community do not have. An example of this advantage is the opportunity to minimise taxation liabilities by concentrating wealth in non-taxed or minimally taxed assets. The people at the lower end of the wealth scale have no such flexibility. Any wealth they hold is held predominantly in bank deposits, the interest on which is fully taxed at their marginal rate of tax. Dilnot's paper shows that people with small amounts of wealth suffer higher effective rates of taxation, for example 47c in the dollar. These effective rates fall rapidly as wealth increases, with the top one per cent facing an effective rate of 9c in the dollar. That serves only to increase and help maintain the inequality of wealth distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Wealth also contributes to and confers a degree of political power on its holders. I do not need to go into any more detail on the influence that wealthy groups and individuals have had on the political direction that Australia has taken in the past. Those groups and individuals have been experts in exercising their power to protect their interests and to maintain the status quo. Wealth also gives its holders choices about lifestyles and activities that are not available to all Australians. It is apparent from the analysis of effective taxation rates that taxation of wealth is biased against the least wealthy in the population. The taxation system has had the effect of making some types of wealthholding more attractive than others. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that capital gains associated with private residences are not taxed aids those in the community who are able to afford a basic house. This leads to a benefit to the house owner when he or she retires, and helps to fund his or her aged care. We, of course, all see the value of this arrangement, but the inequity is that at the wealthier end of the scale there is an incentive for people to invest in nonproductive residences in order to achieve the maximum tax-free capital gain. The recent housing boom in Sydney with several well-publicised sales of harbourfront residences, for what can only be called obscene sums, is a case in point. The tax treatment of capital gains, both in rental property with negative gearing components, and in share transactions with a tax incentive to invest in Australian companies, also allows the more wealthy end of the spectrum to gain, because the real capital gains are only taxed after income is adjusted downwards for inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a more equitable tax base we must understand fully the distribution of wealth and the way in which it is held. One of the most important contributing factors to the concentration of wealth in the top 10 per cent of the population is inheritance. There are no figures available in Australia, but figures from the United States of America show that in 1962, 34 per cent of people with assets in excess of $500,000 had inherited a substantial proportion of that wealth. The effect of inheritance is not only to maintain the status quo but it also allows for further growth of wealth in the upper percentiles of the population with consequent reinforcement of the inequalities. A United Kingdom report from 1979 reinforces this finding by indicating that 60 per cent of the top 0.1 per cent of the population were preceded by wealthy fathers. There is, of course, a simple answer to the question of inheritance; and that is the reintroduction of estate and gift duties. These would ensure that some redress of present inequalities is made. The reintroduction would be aimed at redressing the most apparent inequality in relation to the top 10 per cent of the population. Such new imposts would, of course, need to be specifically targeted so as not to affect the ordinary householder who, naturally, will want to pass his or her estate on to children and family. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to justify the introduction of such taxes on the grounds of philosophy and fairness. The passing of wealth from generation to generation confers relatively tax-free benefits on the recipients. But it is harder to justify such a return to estate and gift duties if we do not have a clear view of where wealth is located within society and without a complete understanding of the effect of such imposts across the population. Certainly, none of us would wish to see the imposition of a tax regime on inheritance which would affect ordinary Australians in a way that would prevent them from making proper disposition of their property to their family and children. None of us wants to see Australia as a country where there is a huge disparity between rich and poor. This disparity is evident, however, in some areas of our bigger cities where the haves and have-nots are living cheek by jowl. We do not want a situation like New York where differences in both wealth and values are so apparent and so at odds. These differences can lead only to resentment, driving groups to look outside the normal framework of government for solutions. So I echo the sentiments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who, in his maiden speech in this House, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We have moved inexorably towards that destabilised and dangerous position described by Disraeli as `Two Nations', the nation of the privileged and the nation of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>I have brought to the attention of the House today the lack of data in Australia on the distribution of wealth. I have pointed out some inequalities that divide our country into the privileged and powerful at one end and the poor and the powerless at the other. The obscenity of having 10 per cent of the population holding over half of this nation's private wealth is a matter of concern to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also outlined some of the problems relevant to our taxation system and the way in which these problems reinforce the existing status quo. It is our responsibility to all Australians as guardians of our country's future to take the myth of Australian egalitarianship and mateship and to put some reality into it. We can only redress the existing inequalities if we know the facts. We can only know the facts if the Government makes a collection of data concerning wealth a matter of priority and commissions a study to recommend measures to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution in our country. In this way all Australians can know the facts and be certain of the Government's commitment to its own vision of Australia as a nation where all citizens can truly have a fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the House calls on the Government to collect statistical information on the distribution of wealth and to commission a study to report on measures to reduce the inequality of wealth in Australia. The preamble to the motion suggests bipartisan political concern regarding the current levels of wealth inequality. There is broad concern at the number of poor in our society, particularly when contrasted with the obscenity of high-flying entrepreneurs scrambling over one another to accumulate more debt-ridden assets. However, the question should be asked whether equality of itself is achievable or even desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no argument that in our country all are born equal and that all should have equal opportunity. However, to suggest that all should be kept equal is to ignore the important role that incentive plays in building our society. One cannot legislate for equality of achievement. A government can offer the opportunity but those who put in the greatest effort are surely entitled to the rewards of their endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> Many who advocate a redistribution of wealth are motivated by the Robin Hood philosophy: taking from the rich and giving to the poor. This Government has invented a whole range of new taxes which have been very effective in taking a bigger share of the national cake, discouraging even the most hard-working Australians from succeeding. Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is proud of his record in broadening and developing new tax bases. Although the Treasurer boasts of broadening the tax base, one does not make one man rich by making another man poor. Governments have a much better record of making the rich poor than they do of making the poor rich. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more important for us as a nation that we create more wealth rather than waste what little we have arguing about who should possess it. If we are going to commission studies and research let us devote the maximum resources to studying ways of building up our nation and increasing its economy. Our national success is built upon the individual success of its people. Our country prospers when its people prosper. We should be proud of those in our nation who succeed and encourage them, not belittle them and attempt to take away their achievements just because others are not so successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The preamble also speaks of the maiden speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) almost 10 years ago in which he referred at some length to the need for a caring society to devote more of its resources to helping the poor and disadvantaged. What a change there has been in the attitude of the honourable member for Wills since he has become Prime Minister. These days he prefers the company of the rich and the infamous, and the praise of the Brotherhood of St Laurence in his maiden speech contrasts vividly with the insults he recently handed out to that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> His promise that no child would live in poverty by 1990 was laudable, but when he declared last year that the promise had been fulfilled, he clearly indicated that he had lost touch with the real world and forgotten the message of his maiden speech. The longest reigning Labor Prime Minister in Australia has sadly impoverished the nation but he has done little to relieve individual personal poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that there has been a significant redistribution of wealth in Australia over recent years. The Labor Government's economic policies have created a new poor, new poverty traps, and a new generation of disadvantaged Australians. Some of these new poor still have assets but little or no disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's economic wealth has been built upon small business and the primary sector. However, it is from just these groups-under constant assault of the economic policies of the Labor Government-that many of our nation's new poor are emerging. Farmers' terms of trade have declined significantly and further reductions of over 50 per cent are predicted for 1990-91. Small business has been squeezed by high levels of taxation and increasing wage demands and other costs beyond its control. This Government has presided over the greatest exodus of farmers in the history of our nation, and the level of small business bankruptcies and closures rises with monotonous regularity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's assets tests frequently deny small businessmen and farmers access to family allowance payments, Austudy, and the like, trapping them and their families in a poverty cycle. Almost half the farm children in the South Burnett in my electorate are living in families which have had negative incomes for the majority of the past seven years. These people are a part of the new poor created by the policies of Labor in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In an excellent series last month in the Courier-Mail, rural editor, Gordon Collie, reported on the poverty that `is rearing its head in the Queensland bush'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Hardly anyone in the city has noticed yet. They still have bountiful food on the table and all that macro-economic business about billion dollar export earnings is too hard for most to understand. Just about everyone in the rural sector is hurting. Government and private farm financial advisers are reporting a sharp rise in the number of farm families hopelessly in debt. Land valuations have been on the slide, eroding equity, pushing more and more families beyond hope of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Banks are reluctant to order fire sales for fear of a chain reaction. They see little point in owning a stack of deeds to unsaleable land. </PARA>
<PARA>In an accompanying editorial entitled `The Bush Needs a Helping Hand', the Courier-Mail highlighted `personal and corporate taxation, Government duties on fuel and a plethora of other charges which flow from burdensome bureaucracy' as causes of `the hardship factor'. The editorial called for `a little vision to comprehend the facts of life'. Quite a remarkable editorial, coming as it did from the Courier-Mail, which these days is little more than a newsletter for the Queensland Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> These days the majority of rural Australians are not farmers. The vacant farm homes and abandoned properties are being occupied by a new generation of rural resident. Many thousands of people are forsaking the increasingly degraded lifestyle of our capital cities and choosing to live amidst the peace and the quiet of the bush. </PARA>
<PARA> Some come with an expectation of actually crafting a subsistence lifestyle from their few acres, fooled by the city-created image of wealthy landed gentry. Some are already invalided out of the work force or are having difficulty finding employment. Unfortunately, for most of these people there are no jobs when they move to their new community. They often find that, in addition to a long duration of unemployment, they have left their friends behind and find it difficult to adjust to a rural lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural residential estates are becoming major poverty traps and social problem areas. In a recent series in the South Burnett Times, Mr Rick Palmer discussed the problems of the rural residential dweller. He said they were attracted `80 per cent by the pure economics of cheap housing and 20 per cent by the desire for a rural lifestyle'. He pointed out that many of the rural residential subdivisions had been approved in years gone by and did not have basic amenities such as electricity and sealed roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Palmer's series on the social changes in the South Burnett spoke about the appalling living conditions being experienced by some of these new settlers, whom he described as `living in abject poverty'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Palmer reported neighbourhood discontent about the `hovel-type dwellings' being built by some. Where houses were not visible from the road they were sometimes built without council approval. He reported one complaint of six families living on the one block at the one time without any toilet, power, or fresh water facilities. A survey by a Kingaroy surgeon, Dr Phil Benjamin, concluded that over half of that shire's population growth over the past three years was made up of welfare recipients. </PARA>
<PARA> In Nanango an adult self-help group has been established. Mrs Glad Duxsbury from the group expressed concern about the lack of incentive to work. She said that there was little difference between the dole and their wages and the loss of the pensioner health card could effectively mean those in low paying jobs were better off financially by not working. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's directive to suspend unemployment benefits to people moving to areas where there were reduced job opportunities frequently applies to this immigrant population group, leaving these new settlers with little or no money for survival. </PARA>
<PARA> The surge of development has resulted in the creation of 2,500 rural residential subdivision blocks in the Nanango Shire alone and a further 1,200 rural blocks in the neighbouring Wondai Shire. Many of these subdivisions were undertaken by big name developers and sold in southern capitals and overseas to buyers who had never even seen them. </PARA>
<PARA> In the coastal city of Hervey Bay, Australia's fourth fastest growing local authority area and another locality populated by people relocating from the southern cities, unemployment stands at 21 per cent. In the Nanango Shire, despite the presence of the Tarong power station, unemployment is at 16.6 per cent, almost treble the national average. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to recognise, as a society, this significant change in the population. There are still plenty of good reasons to live in a rural environment and there can be no doubt that the population drift is going to continue. Rural areas are great places in which to raise a family and to develop a healthy and happy lifestyle. Indeed, the move to the country should be encouraged for economic as well as social reasons. Governments need to ensure the provision of services appropriate to meet the needs of this new population group. They should also launch a positive program to encourage industry into regional areas to ensure that there are employment opportunities, not just poverty, awaiting those joining the movement to the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I thought the contribution of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) actually confirmed the thrust of the motion that we need some basis of knowledge about wealth distribution, not just guesswork, hunch, suspicion or superstition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is essential that members of parliament and, even more importantly, our advisers in the bureaucracy who make the increasingly important decisions and provide critical input into the policy process, have some understanding about how the economic system works in practice and what the distribution of wealth is. Surprisingly little is known about the precise distribution of wealth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me declare an interest for a moment and quote myself as an authority in this area. In the first edition of Sleepers, Wake!, published in 1982, I relied heavily on material that came out of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which was set up by the Whitlam Government. Even when Henderson carried out his poverty inquiry in the mid-1970s he in his turn was relying on surveys that had been carried out by the universities of Macquarie and Queensland between 1966 and 1968. So when the appropriate Henderson report was published in 1978, the material included was already 10 to 12 years out of date. I used that material in the earlier editions, but when I came to prepare the sixteenth impression of Sleepers, Wake! for 1990, it seemed ridiculous to use figures that were 22 to 24 years out of date. I spent some time trying to get the best information on the distribution of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> There had been a series of small-scale surveys and certain interesting pieces of data came out of those surveys. First, the people who prepared them were not exactly willing to sign an affidavit on them!  They were simply indicative; a fair approximation. The short answer is that we simply do not know the size of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1982, based on the work of Podder in the Henderson inquiry, I published a neat little pyramid `Distribution of Wealth and Income in Australia 1966-68', which compared the figures for disposable income after tax and net worth assets. That indicated that the lower 50 per cent of the population in Australia, the 50 per cent of people at the bottom of the pyramid, had 15.45 per cent of the net worth assets; the top 5 per cent had just on 25 per cent; the next 5 per cent had 12 per cent; and in the middle, 40 per cent of the population had 48 per cent of the net worth. </PARA>
<PARA> When I tried to get updated material to represent the situation of the 1980s, it was very much vaguer. I quote from Sleepers, Wake!:</PARA>
<PARA>Recent analyses by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Dr Peter Saunders of the University of New South Wales suggest that inequality of income has increased slightly since 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA>This needs to be underlined:</PARA>
<PARA>(Data on wealth has not been collected since the Henderson inquiry). </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is a table which I have not cleared with the Opposition. It might be useful if the table could be incorporated; otherwise I would simply read out figures. I seek leave of the House for that table on page 124 to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The passage continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1981-82 Australia's income distribution was less egalitarian than Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden (the most equal of all), more so than the United States or Germany. Without a wealth inquiry, estimates of poverty rely on sampling. The National Institute of Economic and Industry Research (NIEIR) estimated that income units (especially the single unemployed) below the poverty line in Australia increased from 11.5 per cent in 1981-82 to 12.4 per cent in 1985-86.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a tremendous amount of information that we need. More recently, Andrew Dilnot of the University of Melbourne was able to conclude that in the mid-1980s the wealthiest one per cent of Australians held 20 per cent of total wealth, the top 5 per cent four, and the top 10 per cent 55 per cent. At the other extreme, at least 30 per cent had no wealth. They owed more than they possessed in assets, usually their homes, and the bottom 50 per cent possessed only 1.5 per cent of private wealth. Dilnot pointed out that it was inheritance, wealth creating wealth, and the tax system-rather than physical exertion or intellect-which determined a person's wealth. As pointed out eloquently by the honourable member for Denison, who introduced the motion, Dilnot concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Closer examination of the composition of wealth uncovers a pattern of asset holding which is consistent with the highly distorting taxation of personal savings. </PARA>
<PARA>Concern with the distribution of wealth has a number of dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, extreme wealth concentration can be associated with the development of a super wealthy power group whose collective actions may be inimical to the efficient operation of the market system. When ownership of strategic resources lies in a few hands, there is a danger that governments can be forced into action which confers further benefits on the wealthy to the cost of the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, great wealth is sometimes seen as conferring prestige and flexibility on its owners, in ways which are distinct from the benefits of the implied income flow. Thirdly, wealth is sometimes seen as relevant to policy proposals of other kinds and wealth statistics are seen as important in assessing the impact of such policy reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put these concerns, particularly the last, into perspective by concentrating on the current privatisation debate, not otherwise before the House; it may be the only time that we discuss it in this chamber. Andrew Dilnot's analysis of personal wealth in Australia subdivided that wealth held by percentile groups into housing or property, equities or shares, and interest on earnings and in superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> The first form of wealth accretion held by an individual is interest bearing deposits which appear to plateau at about $4,000 for the bottom 20 per cent. Any subsequent accumulation comes in the form of housing. It is not until the top 5 per cent of the distribution is reached that a fairly dramatic shift into equities or shares begins. For the top percentile, 61 per cent of wealth is held in the form of equities. Shares are the least spread of all wealth forms studied. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remind people that this dissection of wealth is not the total wealth of Australia but is an examination of private wealth. To this must be added the wealth of the public sector which, it goes without saying, is owned collectively so far by all Australians. We each have an equal stake in such enterprises as Australian Airlines Ltd, Qantas Airways Ltd, Telecom Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Our share in public assets counteracts to a certain degree the inequality in the distribution of private wealth. Privatisation is a shift in ownership away from the perfectly egalitarian distribution of public assets to what has, in other cases, proved to be the greatly distorted and unequal distribution of private assets. If privatisation goes ahead without concern for who gains the shares in our government business enterprises (GBEs) over a short time, it can be predicted with a fair degree of confidence that they will end up in the hands of comparatively few people. </PARA>
<PARA> This underlines the social concerns that I mentioned earlier associated with concentrated ownership of certain types of wealth. These problems can be overcome. If the Government proceeds with privatisation it is imperative that shares in GBEs are spread as widely as possible and that the spread is permanent. I know, for example, that the Treasurer (Mr Keating), is undertaking some research following the last Caucus meeting on this subject about the potential role of the various trade union superannuation funds in having a share of the action. Employees, by the investment they put into the superannuation funds, can have a share of the action which by its very nature will be dispersed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dilnot data indicates that the increasingly uniform spread of superannuation among workers provides an avenue for distribution of shares. The percentage of heads of income units in each wealth category who are members of super schemes ranges from 19 per cent in the lowest three deciles to a maximum of 48 per cent in any other decile or percentile group, including the top percentiles. If shares were confined to superannuation funds, the spread of wealth would be greatly maximised among participants. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the funds were more interested in maximising the return to their members as required under their trust deeds than in forcing governments to confer benefits upon a few shareholders, thus overcoming one of the major concerns mentioned earlier. The implementation of employee participation schemes, with workers in GBEs owning shares while they remain employed in a privatised or semi-privatised GBE, will further correct the distortion of wealth distribution in the form of equities as the bulk of employees will be in the lower deciles of wealth ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation is a vexed question for those who consider economics as a tool to achieve desirable social ends. For many, privatisation takes public wealth away from the poorest in our society and redistributes that wealth to the richest. I have urged the Government that, should privatisation go ahead as expected, shares should be limited to employees of GBEs and to superannuation funds to maximise the distribution effects of this wealth transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of privatisation is only one example of how necessary it is to collect and publish national information on wealth distribution in Australia so that measures and policies can be developed to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution and increase the equality of life's chances for all Australians, especially our youth. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still blundering around in the dark if we do not understand precisely what we are talking about. For an informed debate about the future of the economy of this country we need that statistical base. I regard the failure to collate that information as a major failure. Many honourable members will remember the former member for Hawker, Mr Ralph Jacobi, who was consistent in his advocacy that we have a proper wealth inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> We need the data. Unfortunately that data is not readily available. The result is that we have to rely on surveys which have all the methodological deficiencies that are sometimes associated with surveys no matter how skilfully they are carried out. I hope that the House will give bipartisan support to this suggestion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to follow the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). What was a laudable and simple motion a few minutes ago has now become one of the most complicated exercises I have ever faced. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Lalor speak. A great deal of information pours out of this honourable member when he addresses this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was not mentioned, of course, was the political will that needs to be placed behind this motion to have it carried through. It could be seen as perhaps a veiled attack on the government of the day. We have to look at the reality. We have to come into this House and talk about the realities. The realities are that in 1983, when the honourable member for Lalor was certainly in this House, this Government, under our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), invited Professor Peter Karmel, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, to prepare a proposal for a similar inquiry. In 12 months Karmel's plan for a five-year study had been dropped. The cost of that study would have been $8m. It was shelved. By 1985 that was all gone. </PARA>
<PARA> By 1986, under the direction of the ministerial subcommittee comprising the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the now Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and Senator Peter Walsh, an inter-departmental committee was set up but by mid-1987 the ministerial committee had failed to meet. The reality of what is happening in Australia today is embarrassing for those who sit on the other side of the House, having regard to the history of their Party and their leadership in regard to this type of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> I also learned from the honourable member for Lalor today that a GBE is a government business enterprise. I assumed that a GBE was a great big ego! It is not; it is a government business enterprise and I like the way that it has been used. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lalor mentioned that information that we need is out of date. I am afraid that this debate is seven years out of date. This should have been promised seven years ago. A former member of this House, Mr Jacobi, was mentioned. We should have been having this debate seven years ago. The information this nation needs should be presented to the next government so that we can get out of the difficulties that we face today. I refer the members of this House to the Australian Labor Party platform of 1984 where it was said:</PARA>
<PARA> Deficiencies in the availability of information essential for responsible decision making will be corrected and the Australian Bureau of Statistics will be strengthened to ensure that all relevant statistical information for planning is collected and published promptly. </PARA>
<PARA>This has been set down in the Australian Labor Party's policy statements. It has not been followed through by this Government. The word for today perhaps is `transient'. That word was used extensively yesterday, and perhaps this whole debate and argument have been transient now for seven years. The debate has continued to move but it has not arrived anywhere. It is interesting that an honourable member is now prepared to bring the debate to this House and put it before the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be some condemnation of what has really happened over that seven years and we should address ourselves to this very carefully. I agree that there are people who have grown very wealthy in the last seven years and there are people who have become very poor, especially in my electorate of Corinella. We spoke of reports from many bodies which are interested in the health and welfare of people in the lower income bracket, and a few have been referred to today. My area is facing that exact situation. What have we failed to do? In the last seven years we have torn middle Australia to pieces. That is why there is now a greater difference between the rich and poor: the middle man has been cut out. A good example of that is that there is nowhere else to go to to buy concrete or pipes in Australia today. This Government has created monopolies. The little guy has gone. The contractors have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> Even today's papers talk about what is happening in Victoria, especially with regard to retail sales. Boy, are they transient at the moment. They are moving downwards. Our long-term outlook is pretty tragic for this nation at this time because we have lost those middle people. Therefore, they are not out there supporting around them that social base and that social fabric that were there before. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example is the young entrepreneurs who at the moment have their trucks parked around this building. Honourable members should ask them about the distribution of wealth in Australia and how we should go about it. Perhaps they might give us a more commonsense approach to what we are doing, might make the argument more simple. I understand that the Government wants information with which to make quality decisions. That is terribly important. But are there not simple ways of going about that, especially in regard to how we are taxing our community in such a big way?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That a Joint Select Committee, to be known as the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act 1975, be appointed to inquire into and report upon the following matters: the practice and application of the following aspects of the Family Law Act 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether Parts II and III of the Act have been found to provide adequately for effective counselling and independent mediation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether Part VII of the Act has been found to provide for fair and equitable resolution of custody and access matters and, in particular, whether the interests of children are being effectively safeguarded;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether Part VIII of the Act has been found to be effective in arriving at fair and equitable maintenance property settlements;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) whether the enforcement provisions of Part XIII of the Act have proven in practice to be effective and how the operation of this Part has been affected by the introduction of the Child Support Agency scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether, in the above mentioned Parts of the Act, excessive discretion has been conferred upon the Family Court and, if so, how that discretion may be better defined. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the committee confine its inquiry and report to the terms of the Family Law Act 1975 and associated relevant policy matters. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That provisions relating to the powers, procedure and composition of the committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this resolution and requesting that it concur and take action accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>The genesis of this matter is a private member's motion moved in another place, that is, the Senate, by our colleague on this side of the House, Senator David Brownhill. The shadow Cabinet and the coalition party room believe that Senator Brownhill's motion would be strengthened were there to be a joint parliamentary inquiry of both the Senate and the House of Representatives rather than simply a Senate committee inquiry. That is not denigrating the role of Senate committees by any means but it is just felt that the ambit of this very important area would be better reflected, bearing in mind the number of representations that members of parliament get on family law matters, if the House were to be involved as well as the Senate. It therefore falls to me as shadow Attorney-General to move this motion today. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also add by way of preface that such a decision by the coalition in no way detracts from the general principle that we on this side of the House adopt towards family law and matrimonial causes matters where we generally, other than on procedural and technical amendments, on fundamental matters relating to family law and matrimonial causes, allow a conscience vote to our party members. On this the party room spoke and said that if there is a proposal for an inquiry, why not propose in the House at the same time as the Senate that such an inquiry be a joint one. It is believed that the family law system in Australia today is in need of a systematic and comprehensive review.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members and senators are, as I have just indicated, frequently confronted with grievances, or alleged grievances, from persons who have had some sort of experience with the family law system. In 1975 when the Family Law Act was passed by this Parliament that legislation was believed to be a watershed in the reform of the law relating to the dissolution of marriages. In my own case I believe that it did make some considerable advances. Having been a practitioner in this arena, in that frightful area of having to establish fault, et cetera, I know a whole host of matters were unquestionably improved by the Family Law Act. The reality is that there have been many alleged injustices proffered since that Act came forward. As I will touch on very briefly in a moment, the number of divorces has become a matter of community concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in the old place when that legislation was debated. The former Labor Prime Minister, the Hon. Gough Whit- lam, spoke then, among other things, of the aim of the Family Court. He did so in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Here will be a Court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Now some 15 years later the Family Law Act and the family law system generally are believed by many to be in need of a comprehensive review. The issues were succinctly put by the authors of a leading text, H.A. Finlay and R.J. Bailey-Harris, entitled Family Law in Australia, in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . what we are now seeing is the abandonment of these lofty aspirations and hopes before they have been given a proper chance . . . we suggest the legal and political establishment neither fully understood or desired an integrated Government organ intended to function on a cooperative, inter-disciplinary basis. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, as with so many areas, I do not necessarily endorse every element of that quotation, but it is symptomatic of many of the concerns that are expressed in this very delicate and extremely personal and human arena. If there are problems it is believed that it is now time for the legislature to examine the form of legislation that is down. That is why the Opposition is supporting Senator Brownhill's belief that it is time that we as law-makers took up the challenge, examined the family law system and ascertained not just whether those lofty aspirations that I have referred to have been achieved but whether in an area of very great sensitivity to so many people we can improve the system for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for 1989 indicate that nearly one in every three marriages results in divorce. A recent report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies indicates that the financial costs associated with marital breakdown total some $2 billion per annum. The cost of litigation is a subject for another day-just how many average Australians are unable to even contemplate litigation to rectify some manifest injustice that may be dumped upon them and, in addition, the cost to taxpayers of the legal system itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In the narrow confines of family law both the cost to taxpayers of the maintenance of the family law system and the cost to individuals in seeking redress, assistance or counselling or the dissolution of a marriage are very great indeed. It does, of course, have to be recognised that regardless of whatever family law system we may have the social phenomena of divorce may continue unless we have an adequate multi-disciplinary approach to the problem. The desirability of such an approach is, in the view of those on this side of the House-I do not intend to inject any politics into this sort of matter and debase it-is nevertheless reflected in the coalition's law and justice policy which encourages the use of counselling services before a marriage breakdown and the use of mediation services during the process of breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for such an inquiry, as first proffered by Senator Brownhill-and this motion endorses and broadens it-would ensure that the family law system would be examined in a broad manner and not simply from a narrow legal perspective. An illustration, though, of the difficulties we face in this area can be found in the recently introduced Family Law Amendment Bill 1990. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) will be familiar with the submissions that are coming in regarding this Bill which show that, notwithstanding the good intentions behind it, legislating in this area is fraught with difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of ad hoc inquiries in the area, including, firstly, a recent report by a Family Court steering committee on the use of mediation procedures in the court; secondly, a report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies on the effectiveness of marriage counselling services; and, thirdly, reports by the Australian Law Reform Commission on matrimonial property and by the Family Law Council on access. What we are saying is that these inquiries and the reports that have resulted from them can be taken as perhaps a starting point for a more thorough, broader examination of the efficacy of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 May this year, in the West Australian newspaper, the Attorney-General is reported to have indicated that it is the Government's view that such a parliamentary review would be unnecessary in the light of the various reviews, some of which I have mentioned today. We do not agree and we sincerely hope that, when this matter is adjourned today, the Government will see the wisdom of the move and will support us. It should know that there is a need for such a comprehensive review so that views may be put forward on how the family law system can be made more accessible, more cost effective and more relevant to the community, so that from such an inquiry an improved system may be proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion moved today by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), as he quite correctly pointed out, had its genesis in the Senate by way of a proposal put forward by Senator Brownhill. Two issues are raised by it: firstly, whether an inquiry into the Family Law Act is required, having regard to the various matters specified in the motion; and, secondly, if so, what is the most appropriate mechanism that this particular inquiry should proceed with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to address both of those issues. I think it is important to be able to place this matter in context. Nineteen-ninety is the fifteenth anniversary of the passage of the Family Law Act. It was a hugely significant piece of social reform in this country. It is a tribute to the then Attorney-General, the late Lionel Murphy, that he pioneered this legislation and gained approval for it by both Houses of Parliament. At that time it was quite an achievement, given that the period 1972-75 was not the easiest period in which a government had to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the Family Law Act followed a number of Senate inquiries. One was by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, as it was then called, in 1971. A Law Council of Australia report came up with the first draft of the Act in 1972, and there was another Senate committee inquiry in 1974. That particular inquiry, which relied extensively on a paper prepared by Watson QC, was the basis of our current Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the intervening period since the Act was passed in 1975 it has hardly been static. The Act has evolved and there have been numerous reviews into various aspects of its operation. This Parliament has passed very substantial amendments to it. Certainly, even in my brief time here, we have seen the introduction of very major measures, such as the Child Support Agency, which completely rewrites and redirects the question of child maintenance. We have also seen the emergence of many pressing issues. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note, as the honourable member for Kooyong mentioned, that we as members of parliament now receive most of our complaints not so much in the area of divorce itself, that is, principal relief under the Act, but in the area of what was described under the Matrimonial Causes Act and is still so described under our current law as ancillary relief-matters concerned with children and property. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate which occurred when the Act was first passed-the honourable member mentioned the contribution of the then Prime Minister; and I have also looked at the contribution of other members, including the Attorney-General at that time-there was a great deal of focus on this question of principal relief. That is the area on which the debate focused in 1975. That is where a great amount of the discussion on the social implications of this legislation was focused. The question of ancillary relief was still very much, as the term implies, off to the side. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act, I think it would be fair to say, despite the criticisms we may well have of it, certainly markedly improved the question of principal relief. Certainly, as the shadow Attorney pointed out, the grounds which one had to establish under the old Matrimonial Causes Act really did nothing in terms of the dignity of parties and the ability of people to live through what is without doubt the most traumatic part of a person's life-the breakdown of the major relationship, the marriage, in which they were involved. Certainly, the Act has been successful in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the focus at that time on principal relief has led to problems. If one reads the speeches at that time one sees that it was assumed that the processes of counselling and conciliation which would be set up in this court would be nothing like what was available in other courts. The whole process of the court was designed so that it would not be a case of two parties slugging it out in the normal conflict situation in which our courts operate; rather, it would provide a process to bring people together and talk them through the issues. It was thought that those processes would prove to be the way to overcome disputes concerning custody of and access to children and the division of property. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that was probably pie in the sky stuff at the time. Even though there were the best intentions in the world, it has not proved to be successful. Certainly, as someone who practiced quite extensively in family law prior to my election to this place, I know that the real emotion and hurt often surfaced in conflicts over children and the division of property. </PARA>
<PARA> My opinion is that the basic provisions as they are set down in the law are probably adequate, but the court itself has laboured under great difficulty. For instance, it was often said at the time that the Act was passed that one of the benefits would be to remove ancillary relief from the hands of magistrates courts, which did not have provision for counselling and where one would be rubbing shoulders with the drink driver and the petty criminal. That was a particularly degrading experience to go through. It was said that the transfer of ancillary relief cases from the magistrates court to the Family Court would be a major achievement. Ironically, at no stage have the magistrates courts in this country played a very major role in the jurisdiction of this particular Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is ironic that in Senator Murphy's speech at the time he made mention of the fact that legal aid would be available to all in need to make sure that they had access to the Family Court. Legal aid guidelines almost inevitably force people to go to the magistrates court because of the cost implications-the exact reverse of what was intended at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems which have not been dealt with. Magistrates still have to deal with a lot of maintenance applications. There are fewer maintenance applications now than in the past, but a certain amount of that work will continue for some time. Certainly magistrates will be required to deal with interim custody applications and uncontested custody applications. Recently the jurisdiction of magistrates in terms of property has been increased, I think from $5,000 to $20,000. So, they are dealing with even larger numbers of smaller property settlements. Again, this is to do with time and cost. Over the years the Family Court has had its problems with resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the court has responded to the major question of property settlement has been through the development of the Order 24 conference, or its forerunner, the Regulation 96 conference. This process has been successful in resolving property disputes. I think the figures are that some--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Flags Amendment Bill 1990 is to amend the Flags Act 1953 in simple terms to ensure that no attempt to change the Australian flag can be made without reference to the people of Australia. In other words, there should be a referendum of all Australians before any attempt is made to change our flag. Many people throughout Australia are very proud of our flag. People have been prepared to give their lives for it. It is recognised throughout the nation that Australians can look with pride at their flag as a symbol of national unity. </PARA>
<PARA> I present this Bill on behalf of the Opposition yet again in an attempt to ensure that the minority who from time to time have tried to change this great flag of ours do not have that opportunity without first getting majority support of the Australian people. I might add that I think they would find it extraordinarily difficult to get that support. The Bill reflects the strong and unequivocal support the Liberal and National parties have for our flag. This support, of course, reflects view of the majority. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Government to accept this Bill, to accept that any suggestion to change the flag should be subject to a referendum. I challenge the Government to show that it is, in fact, genuine when it claims to support the Australian flag. Obviously, in supporting our flag not only am I conscious of the very strong support that the majority of Australians have shown for this flag since 1901 but also I am very conscious of the fact that the ill-fated Ausflag 88 campaign, which was started in 1985, was a dismal failure. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time when the Australian flag was created, which was, of course, just after Australia became a Commonwealth, it was inaugurated under the slogan `One People: One Destiny: One Flag'. I suggest to all honourable members that that slogan is as true today as it was back in 1901. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that whilst the present Government claims to have a certain amount of support for the Australian flag, that has not always been the case. In fact, for some years the Australian Labor Party had as part of its platform a resolution to change our national flag, although, interestingly, in 1988 the Party platform deleted this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to remove any shadow of doubt about the Government's sincerity. I believe that if the Government refuses to support this legislation, the people of Australia, and indeed all honourable members, will continue to have reason to doubt the Government's sincerity in its supposed new-found support for the flag. I remind honourable members on the other side of the House that the Opposition has attempted to introduce this legislation previously. In fact, since 1985 this legislation has been rejected by the Government on three occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition doubts the Government's support for the present Australian flag. In 1981 in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans was recorded in Hansard as making some very disparaging remarks about the Australian flag. I think those comments are worth repeating today so that they are not forgotten. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA>We can do better than the present undistinguished and undistinctive bit of cloth which we have inherited from our colonial past and which manifestly does not set anybody's pulse racing in the community at large except, perhaps the occasional Returned Services League blimp or a proportion of the Tory backbench opposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than unpatriotic. I think it is downright insulting. Honourable members should not be allowed to forget the words of someone who is now a senior Cabinet Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years there have been some suggestions as to why we might change our flag. I think most of those suggestions are sheer nonsense. It has been suggested that some people may find it difficult to distinguish the Australian flag from others. That suggestion is sheer and utter nonsense. It has been suggested that others may have difficulty recognising our flag. I think that point can be responded to quite simply. If I were to ask people `What does the national flag of Spain or Thailand or Chile or of a number of other countries all around the world look like?', I am sure I would find that Australians would have just as much difficulty in distinguishing other national flags as foreigners would have in recognising our flag. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling some very worthwhile quotations about the importance of why we should look upon our Australian flag as not only a symbol of national unity but also as something that reminds us of some of the great strengths of our democratic country. Our flag symbolises our Australian heritage. It represents the democratic processes we have inherited from the founding fathers of this great nation.</PARA>
<PARA> While some may say that it is important that we recognise that our role should be focused more and more on Asia-and I certainly agree with that view-I still believe we should remind ourselves and future generations that Asia did not give Australia the concept of limited constitutional government. Asia did not give us the priceless heritage of English common law, or of trial by jury, or, most importantly, the Christian concepts of behaviour. Those who talk about removing the Union Jack from the Australian flag should be reminded that the Union Jack is a symbol of Australia's British heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members of what the famous Roman statesman, Cicero, had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Not to know what happened before you were born is always to be a child. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that sentiment reflects very much the importance of the Australian flag in reminding us what happened before we were born. </PARA>
<PARA> As the great English statesman Edmund Burke warned:</PARA>
<PARA> People will not look forward to posterity, who never look back to their ancestors. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many in the community nowadays who seem to think that we should be trying to obliterate our past. I say to all honourable members: I am very proud of our past traditions. I am very proud of the fact that we have so many traditions that we have inherited from the United Kingdom. In particular, I cite limited constitutional government, English common law, trial by jury and, of course, the Christian concepts of behaviour. For all those reasons, I think that we have a--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the very outset let me say in this House that I have never listened to 10 minutes of such hypocrisy in all my life. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in introducing the Flags Amendment Bill stated that the object, to use his words, `is to ensure that there is no change to our existing Australian national flag without a referendum'. At the outset, let me reject the underlying presumption of this Bill, that is, that the Government intends to change our flag by stealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would be very well aware, this is not the first occasion upon which the Opposition has taken up the valuable time of this House with these conspiracy theories. Last year the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) introduced the Flag Amendment Bill of 1989. A very similar Bill was brought before the House as well as the Senate in 1988. When the Bill was introduced in 1988 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated that he had no intention of trying to change the Australian flag. Yet still the Opposition persisted. The honourable member for Hume in his speech in 1989, when he introduced his Bill, appeared to hold the gravest fears that at any moment the Governor-General, using powers available under the Flags Act of 1953, would appoint another flag to replace the Australian national flag. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Governor-General, Bill Hayden, made it perfectly clear in an interview just before his swearing-in in February 1989 that he was in favour of retaining the Australian flag. Of course, the honourable member for Wannon did not want to bring that quotation into the House during his speech, but I will give it. The Governor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> The present flag represents the struggle, achievement and aspirations of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, let me make this point clear: the Australian Labor Party does not have a policy of wanting to change the flag. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the underlying presumption of the Bill before the House an affront to me personally. I have always supported the current flag and I, as a member of this House, have made every effort to ensure that the flag and the information about it are available to schools, the community and service organisations within my electorate. Whenever it is possible, I arrange to present the flag personally. When I visit schools I talk to the students about the history and the significance of our flag. I explain to them that the flag is used as a symbol of national authority. In fact-and the honourable member for Wannon should check his facts-the first time a flag was used in this way on Australian soil was when Cook, and I quote from his journal, `hoisted English colours and in the name of His Majesty King George III, took possession of the whole eastern coast from the above latitude down to this place by the name of New South Wales'. </PARA>
<PARA> The English colours to which Cook referred was the Union flag and not the Union Jack as we know it today. The Union flag consisted only of the St George Cross and the St Andrew's Cross. The cross of St Patrick was not added until 5 November 1800, when the King in Council approved the report of a committee of the Privy Council that the Union flag should be altered. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Union Jack flew in Australia for the whole of the nineteenth century. It was carried by the explorers who unlocked the continent, the mariners who circumnavigated our great south land, and the founding fathers who established the new colonies. From the 1850s a growing Australian nationalism brought forth many unofficial flags, but all of them incorporating the constellation of the Southern Cross, which was universally accepted as the emblem of the great south land. I refer to the flags of the Australian Anti-Transportation League, the goldminers' rebellion at Eureka, the racial riots at Lambing Flat goldfields, and the Federation League. </PARA>
<PARA> With the federation of the six colonies to form a single Commonwealth on 1 January 1901, there was an urgent demand for a new flag for our new nation. Shortly before the opening of the first Parliament it was decided to hold a world-wide competition to obtain designs for two Australian flags: one for official and naval purposes and the other for the merchant navy service. Over 30,000 designs were submitted from all over the world. The judges finally decided to divide the prize money of pounds equally between five entrants because their designs were identical. They were Ivor Evans, a 14-year-old school boy of Melbourne; Anne Darrington from Perth; L.J. Hawkins from Leichhardt in New South Wales; E. Nuttall from Victoria; and N. Stevens from Auckland. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1903-this is another fact that the honourable member for Wannon refused to bring forward-it was announced in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette that King Edward VII had approved a design for the flag of Australia. Of course, the flag was not exactly as we now know it. The star under the Union Jack then had only six points, representing the then six States of the Commonwealth. In 1908 the Government decided there should be a seven-point star under the Union Jack. The extra point represented the Territories. The four main stars of the Southern Cross were also made seven-pointed. </PARA>
<PARA> The flag has been a symbol of nationhood in war and in peace. It has become intrinsically linked to our successes. It was flown over the site of the new national capital in 1908; on the first ships of the Australian Navy in 1910; and over Australia's base on the Antarctic continent. Since 1908 it has been raised for medal winners at every Olympic Games, and in 1956 it flew with pride of place as the flag of the host nation at the Melbourne Olympics. The flag was carried into New Guinea at the outbreak of World War I, by the Anzacs who landed at Gallipoli, and by the diggers who fought on the battlefields of France. </PARA>
<PARA> Our forces again fought under it in World War II. When Singapore was retaken in 1945, the first flag to fly was an Australian ensign. That particular flag had become a source of hope, an inspiration for the prisoners of Changi, the prisoner-of-war camp. It was made secretly by an Australian prisoner, Captain Robert Strawbridge, who at the risk of immediate execution hid that flag in the lining of a calico bag for years. It became very precious to him and the other prisoners during their time in that camp. I am very pleased to see that that flag was finally returned to Australian soil in April of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be forgotten that for many years the flag was regarded as an official flag and its use on land was restricted to government establishments. It was that great Australian Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, who in February 1947 actively encouraged the lifting of restrictions on the flying of the flag and the greater use of the flag on public buildings by schools and private citizens. Also important to note is that it was not until 1951 that King George VI approved a recommendation by the Government that the Commonwealth blue ensign be adopted as our Australian flag. The Flags Act 1953 finally established the Australian national flag and prescribed the Australian red ensign for merchant ships within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I sincerely hope that this puts to rest Opposition allegations that the Government intends to change the flag by stealth and its imputation that only the Opposition is the protector of the flag. Let us hope that its cheap political point scoring is over and that this Parliament's time can be spent on more pressing and critical issues in the future. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) recognises the importance of forest industries to Australia's social and economic future;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) requests the Government to facilitate industries that will add value to our wood resource; and</PARA>
<PARA>(3) strongly opposes minority groups who undermine balanced development projects. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very relevant that the Parliament is considering a motion along these lines today, having regard to the considerations being given by the Cabinet to the forest industries and the fact that so many families are around Parliament House with their trucks showing a concern about not only their futures as regards job opportunities and their livelihood but also the future prosperity of this country. We are dependent upon truck owners, loggers and the people involved in the forest industries to ensure that we do have products which we can export to the world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we had a debate between the Opposition and the Government on a matter of public importance which centred around the economy and the environment in this country coming together in a balanced way which will lead to a sustainable development policy. That is where we should be at as a country in this debate. But, unfortunately, we still have a large number of people out there, to whom I would refer as the radical green element, who continue to have myths put around with regard to the forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we need to understand the extent and importance of the forest industries to Australia. I inform the House of a few figures in connection with that. In 1988-89, our exports in forest industries were worth $500m, but our imports of forest or wood products were worth $2.1 billion-in other words, 10 per cent of our trading debt each year. But the interesting thing is that, of our exports, 74 per cent of that $500m is in woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been saying repeatedly in this Parliament that we have to have added value in our manufacturing industries so that this country can trade its way out of the debt crisis with which it is faced. Yet we have a situation now, as we see with the loggers outside Parliament House, where a decision has not been made by the Federal Government. It is interesting to note that, as a country, we have got ourselves into a position where I understand that on Friday the Federal Cabinet will actually consider which 40 hectare coupes can be logged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a ridiculous situation, as the honourable member for Berowra says, that the Federal Cabinet should have got to that point of discussion. There are other more major issues with which it should be concerning itself, such as the debate about whether land use matters should remain with State governments and so on. There has been procrastination, delay and many inquiries. There have been inquiries to end inquiries. Speaking from my experience, in Tasmania there have been 11 inquiries in 13 years into forest industries, all with the intention of putting an end to inquiries and confrontation between radical greens and the productive side of the community. The following remarks relate to where the forest industries stand at the moment. More than $100m worth of woodchips are burnt each year because the State Government will not make a decision on whether it should proceed with the establishment of a pulp and paper mill. There is no way Australia can become a clever country if it continues down this track.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to the interjection by the honourable member for Wakefield in a moment. As a nation Australia must recognise the importance of environmental qualities. Nobody will deny that. However, at the same time we must marry the economic imperatives of manufacturing in this country. The forest industry is one of the industries in which that can be done successfully, and it should be possible to do it quickly. There has been enough debate on this issue. If Australia exports its wood products as woodchips, as is being done at present, it is losing a tremendous amount. Bleached pulp can be sold for export for $495 a tonne compared with $78 a tonne for exported woodchips. For fine paper exports as much as $995 a tonne can be obtained. At present Australia exports woodchips to Japan and buys back fine paper from that country. Is it any wonder that this country's trade balance is as bad as it is, if that is the way we run our affairs? It is all very well for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to say we need to become a clever country, but what Australia really needs is clever leadership. We need decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What else does the forest industry do? It provides 106,000 jobs throughout Australia and supports many families. As the honourable member for Wakefield asked by way of interjection, what will the industry do for the greenhouse effect? It is important to note that the forest industry is planting l50 million trees a year and cutting down only 20 million a year. That practice has had an advantage, in that companies and private enterprise in Australia have responded to the call and have been planting trees. That will be great for the future of Australia. The forest industry should be given every encouragement to continue its tree planting program. That will reduce the greenhouse effect. An enormous amount of carbon dioxide is converted to oxygen by young vigorous forests. Once trees get beyond 60 or 100 years of age they become static and use the same amount of oxygen as the quantity of carbon dioxide they take from the atmosphere. It is a static equation. Therefore it is important to have young vigorous forests, so this House should give every support possible to the forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The next item I draw to the attention of the House in this debate relates to some of the myths of the radical greens about forest industries. One myth is that the forest industry people, the loggers and pulp mill operators and others, plan for unrestricted development. That was said by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Those in the forest industry do not plan for unrestricted development. A large amount of this nation's forests is now protected, as it should be. That myth is therefore untrue. It is, as I said, a total myth. As I said, Australia is planting seven times more trees than are being harvested. </PARA>
<PARA> The second myth that has been used in the debate, especially regarding the south-east forests, is that they are old growth, pristine, ancient forests which have special spiritual qualities. That has never been the case with forests. Forests change continually; they are never a static phenomenon. There is always serial change. As fires go through different parts of forests in Australia and in other countries, then other trees grow and the forests develop. </PARA>
<PARA> The third myth is that logging will reduce genetic reserves and diversity and will cause a loss of species. If we manage our forests carefully that can be avoided. I want to put on the record that there is probably more genetic diversity in a handful of soil-because of the number of viruses, bacteria and individual species contained in it-than in all of the four-legged species in Australia. So it is nonsense to say that we are going to reduce the amount of genetic diversity by having managed and careful logging in this country. It is not true. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth myth concerns the claim that organochlorides and many of the chemicals which come from our pulp mills are man-made only. Two recent surveys have come out of Sweden which indicate that organochlorides occur naturally in large quantities and flow down the rivers of Sweden, in particular. It has been identified that, even in Sweden, there are 300,000 tonnes of naturally occurring organochlorides-those chemicals which the radical greens have said are very detrimental. Some of them may be, but let us look at this issue scientifically and let us adopt a balanced point of view on these types of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, it is very important that urgent decisions are made concerning the forest industries so that we can adopt a sustainable development approach which marries the interests of our community, including those of the loggers and their families, with our environmental concerns. That is absolutely vital. We can no longer object to progress and development in this industry which is sensitive, scientifically able and accurate, if we are going to overcome many of our difficulties. I urge the House to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). The motion, in seeking balance, rests on the acceptance of some truths which preservationist, fundamentalist propagandists have been conveniently ignoring. The first truth is that disturbance is important in maintaining diversity of habitat in the forest; preservation is often unnatural in the forest. The second truth is that the negative growth which would result from the application of principles espoused by preservationist, fundamentalist propagandists would be a big financial blow to most people, not only in country areas, but also in the cities. The third is that foresters graduating today are, more than ever, environmentalists and ecologists who want a sustainable industry. The fourth is that National Estate areas are not national parks and can be farmed, logged, built on and fished. No government, including the environmentalist-backed Tasmanian Government, has tried to go back on that, and, in relation to the south-east forests issue, it is important to recognise that there need be no more substantial inquiries before a decision is made. A decision can be made now on an integrated logging program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, on the point of disturbance, one of the important points made in the report on the study of biological conservation of the south-east forests by the joint scientific committee, set up by this Government in partnership with the New South Wales Government and actually established on the initiative of Senator Peter Cook, was that disturbance is an important factor in maintaining diversity of habitat in the forest. Natural processes in the forest are a result of disturbance which allows the normal processes of regeneration, growth and death to pass through the various successional stages. So disturbance is natural and there has always been some degree of disturbance. There are people who conveniently forget that. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, it is important to recognise that current forestry operations in the south-east forests recognise that the structure of the forests will change, but under carefully controlled harvesting procedures conducted over a period of 100 years from the year 1990 to the year 2090-that is, 100 years of planning, happening now by forestry in the south-east forests of New South Wales. Under that arrangement all age classes will be represented, including trees well in excess of the age when a commercial crop is harvested. They will be retained to provide hollow bearing trees for natural habitat. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear from the joint scientific study that the committee, which was set up not just of foresters but of people trained in environmental and ecological disciplines, recognised the very important fact that management can and will proceed on a 100-year basis so that the forests will progress gradually to a stage where all age classes of trees will be present up to trees 150 years of age. The old notion of clear-felling, the way it used to be done, has been discarded. It is extremely important that these factors are recognised when we look at the forests issue, especially in the south-east forests of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at this issue from a national viewpoint, the forest products industry has real prospects for $7 billion of investment in export development and import replacement. That is why this Government has established a number of studies, some of them on the recommendation of environmental groups; they have cooperated. They include studies on the recovery of pulpwood following hardwood logging operations in the south-east of New South Wales; the feasibility of establishing a flitch mill in south-eastern New South Wales; the development of a plantation strategy for the south-east forests of New South Wales-I must say that the environmental groups called for this study but did not put in a submission; and value adding manufacture in the sawmilling industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The sawmillers are waiting to buy new equipment so that they can make better use of their timber in the south-east forests of New South Wales and in other areas of Australia. They will do that once they know that they have an industry and that they have security in their industry. They are ready to do it and want to do it. They will make much better use of the timber. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a potential $7 billion of investment in export development and import replacement. Within 10 years or so this investment alone could turn around the current $1.8 billion trade deficit and turn it into a trade surplus. But none of this investment will take place if the current political instability continues. If it gets worse, city people will be hurt as well as country people. Every person who wants to limit the harvesting of our resources must consider that every tonne of ore unmined or trees unharvested has an effect on the income of every pensioner, every wage earner, every social security beneficiary, every business person, every farmer and every retiree. It affects the ability of people to pay mortgages, so it has to be taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, some resources have to be protected. Some areas should not be harvested. But the people outside this Parliament have been waiting for 5 1/2 years for decisions. They are people with families to support and who want to have security of income. They have equipment to pay off and to maintain. The communities around them depend on these people having that security. There is insecurity in the local communities as well. So it is extremely important that we resolve very quickly the issues before the Federal and State governments this week. </PARA>
<PARA> The pulp and paper industry's current capacity in Australia will decline if it cannot move to world scale mills to supply pulp at competitive prices. I include bleached pulp which, for a wide variety of reasons which I will not go into now, some of which are very good reasons, is still in heavy demand. This will increase the current trade imbalance in forest products, running at 10 per cent of foreign debt last financial year. This industry can turn around our trade deficit if it operates in an environmentally sensitive but economically and socially responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we adopt a package that is based on the report of the joint scientific study set up on the initiative of Senator Peter Cook with the cooperation of the New South Wales Government. Now is the time to do it. The study recommendation for a variable minimum area reservation delivers a principled position which we can adopt. It is important that we adopt it because it involves protection of the environment whilst minimising job losses. It is quite clear that logging can proceed in National Estate areas not recommended for reservation by the joint scientific study. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should now honour its previous commitment on wood supply; that is, that timber resource will be guaranteed over the period to July 1993 at a level sufficient to retain the industry at the current level of activity and employment. That is a commitment that we made and that we should now adhere to. The New South Wales Government needs to set up a 15-year licensing system. Senator Richardson recommended to Senator Cook many months ago that we could now proceed to 15-year licences subject to a range of conditions for woodchip export. But we ought at the same time to move towards processing the product in Australia much more than we do now rather than exporting the raw material, as is the case with a wide range of other materials. </PARA>
<PARA> In February the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) guaranteed to the New South Wales Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that there will be sufficient wood resource until such time as a long term industry strategy is developed to protect the environment, secure the resource base for industry access and promote the highest possible value adding of our valuable hardwood resource. It is extremely important that the Prime Minister now adhere to that commitment. This must now be the agenda: today, the four New South Wales and Federal Government Ministers who are having discussions here come to agreement; tomorrow, in-principle endorsement of the joint scientific study; and, by the end of the year, a clear plan from the two Ministers and two governments responsible. Whether it be for the export of woodchips which is the Federal issue or the harvesting of timber which is the New South Wales issue, it is time for them to make a decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally support the proposition moved by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I was delighted to hear also what the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) had to say, but I have to say to him that he can wave in the air all of those reports and those studies, but they do not mean a thing unless there is some action and decisions. I must say to the honourable member that, unless his Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) makes the right decision today, all of the pious platitudes that he has been mouthing today will not go down well with the men surrounding this Parliament with the timber jinkers-people who are really concerned about the future of the timber industry. They have every right to be concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just the people here from the southern areas of New South Wales who are making the point. On the evening of Thursday 23 August in Grafton 3,000 people held a rally because they were fearful of losing their jobs. They are concerned about the future. They are concerned about the future not only of their jobs, but of their families, of Australia and of our forests, because their livelihood depends on the forests. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it is my opinion that the timber industry is not getting a fair go-not under any circumstances-because we find that, while there are sane, sensible and reasonable environmental people, there are a great many that one can describe only as the fanatical ratbag fringe. They are the ones that get all the media coverage; they are the ones that chain themselves to trucks and do untold damage to the future of our logging industry. What we must have are policies for forestry which are rational, reasonable and balanced. After all, our forests are a renewable resource. They are harvested; they are farmed; this is the way it should be. Nobody would deny that in the last century, in the development of Australia, and even earlier this century, mistakes were made. But we have all learnt, and I do not believe there is any sensible, intelligent Australian left who is not a conservationist; everybody must be for the future of our earth, of course. We have to realise that in New South Wales, for instance, one and a half trees are being planted for every tree that is cut, and we want many more. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also realise that the forested areas of Australia are growing every year. This is the reality; yet we hear such incredible statements. I heard a man speaking on radio in northern New South Wales only last week, after the State Government made its sensible, rational decision to support the previous Labor Government's policy on logging the Washpool-a decision which was absolutely right. I must say to the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), who is to be the next speaker, that he had better stand up and say where he stands on the logging of the Washpool. Now is the time for him to stand up and be counted and to let the people that he represents know where he stands on the saving of jobs, the saving of families and the development of export industries for Australia, because this is vitally important. I shall conclude so that he does have a little time to do that. Even though the honourable member for Eden-Monaro took some of his time from him, I will be generous and give up some of my time so that the honourable member for Richmond can tell his electors where he stands. He should put up or shut up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) for putting this motion before the House and I also sincerely trust that not just the honourable member for Braddon but all of his colleagues in his minority group opposite share his recognition of the forest industries. The forest industries are one of the many industries, organisations and resources that are important to our social and economic future. It is indeed gracious, if not timely, that such a motion has been moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon also mentioned in his discussion that the use of the value added products is something which we have to consider greatly because of the economic need of Australia. The use of value added products to enhance our economic well-being is fine. The call to process wood products prior to export so that the clever country can gain is important. What is also important and clever is to ensure that the processing by the clever country is just that-and not, in itself, an environmental disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government put in place guidelines for pulp mills yet the industry ran away from these because it felt that our standards would compromise the operations in other parts of the planet. We cannot back down from our standards. Better production and products from, and extension of, plantations have been and are being implemented. It is unfortunate that there has been a long and critical period of exploitation prior to harvesting on a sustainable basis. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has explained the long term nature of planning that is required. In fact, this long term planning that is required is probably unique in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the extent of forest industry production and the potential exploitation does come down to finding a balance in the degree between preserved estate and the level of exploitation that can be sustained on adjacent and managed regions. Bearing in mind, firstly, that the level of forest cover of this continent 200 years ago was not high; secondly, the recognised need for biological protection of all forms of life from man's impact; and, thirdly, our very late commitment to developing forest resources on a sustainable basis, then both government and community need to extend every assistance to the forest industries to smooth this difficult transition from what I would term a period of production through head down, butt up persistence to one of sustainable development. This assistance must recognise that, like any other industry that is undergoing micro-economic reform that often accompanies new technologies, the forestry industries must also realise and be exposed to these reforms. In the long term it will lessen the impact of our new technologies and assist the integration and acceptance of new approaches. This renewable resource will continue to be productive and to contribute to the future well-being of this country. </PARA>

<PARA>The sky blue, black and white were clear winners, which says a lot for their dedication, ability and coaching, not to mention the moral backing of team management and the club officialdom, which also includes the army of supporters. The results show that the medals were shared around every member of the Cronulla team which must say a lot for their team work</PARA>
<PARA>Bill finished his message by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It was heap good medicine. </PARA>
<PARA>It sure was. I am sure all surf lifesaving clubs which were unable to go to Germany will be delighted to have seen the success of Cronulla and the other clubs which made the effort to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that, despite this sporting achievement, for all surf club members throughout Australia at district, branch and national surfing levels, the surf lifesaving organisation remains a service organisation, with sporting achievement as its secondary activity. Before any surf club member can compete in any interclub sporting event, each competitor must meet his normal surf club obligations of maintaining patrols on the beaches and saving an unbelievably large number of people from drowning around all Australian beaches. Surf club membership demands and gets dedication and an awareness of the tasks required to make our beaches safe and therefore enjoyable to the Australian public, who are often oblivious to the continuing voluntary work of surf club members. </PARA>
<PARA> Though our national and State championships do get media coverage, it is surprising and disappointing that there has been no mention whatever, so far as I have been able to observe, on any of the television channels, in Sydney at least, of this important international event, namely, the world surf lifesaving championships. We will all hope for some change next time. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I wish to raise is indeed parochial. It relates to the small and somewhat isolated suburb of Kurnell. I am delighted to mention in the Federal Parliament that, in the primary school competition in New South Wales, Kurnell public school became the 10B State Rugby League champions. For a school that has only 55 boys attending it this is a wonderful result, and I say well done to John Riley, the Principal, to Andrew Wassell, the coach, and to Smith Hartley from Caltex who generously gave the enthusiastic school team all their gear. I say thank you and well done. I am sorry my parliamentary duties do not allow me to be at the special presentation at the school at this very time today, but I will be visiting soon to congratulate them for I hope some of these boys will go up in the league and play for the Cronulla Sharks. I see some honourable members smiling and being amused that I am mentioning this in the national Parliament. Well, Kurnell is the birthplace of the nation and it is a part of my electorate that does not have too many advantages. I think it is just wonderful that the school has achieved the 10B State championships in rugby league for public schools. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third sporting matter I wish to raise in the short time I have left to speak. While I was overseas in the winter recess on my study tour it was my happy experience to attend the 1990 Summer Special Olympic Games. These were held in my birthplace, namely, Glasgow, and it was an inspiration to see quite a number of the events and to meet quite a number of the world figures attending these games. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990 summer games consisted of some 2,200 athletes from 31 countries with 2,000 volunteers. It was chaired by Mr Bill Hughes and 32,000 people were at the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics. It is true to say that the whole of Glasgow took the Special Olympics to heart. The organisation was superb and it was a great experience meeting and talking at length with Mrs Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder and honorary chairman of Special Olympics International. Her main objectives in establishing these special games was to seek the prevention of mental handicap by identifying its cause, and to improve the means by which society deals with its citizens with mental handicaps. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of the special games has been spectacular. We are lucky in Australia to have a fine committee and it is my intention to speak on this subject on further occasions in the House. </PARA>
<PARA> It was inspiring in Glasgow to see the diversity of people who get behind and support, as officers or directors, the work of Special Olympics International.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, it was my special experience to meet with Mrs Shriver and members of her family and also to meet with Queen Noor of Jordan, who had managed by enthusiasm to have that country included in the European Games; Dr Hilary, whom we have met here in this House, the charming wife of the Irish President; the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow; my close friend Sir Eldon Griffiths, MP, Chairman of the Special Olympics, United Kingdom, and former Minister for Sport; and Tom Songster, the international director. </PARA>
<PARA> Having had this lifelong association with the mentally handicapped, being at the European games was a special inspiration. I hope to speak more on this subject in this House; I have done so on previous occasions. I wish Will Hoehndorf and his team achievement and success, and I hope that in the future we will see that encouragement is given for the continuance and further development of special games within and throughout Australia. I shall be speaking on this subject again and again in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in conclusion that the sad thing is that it is just too expensive to have people who volunteer their services to help to get these teams, in large numbers, to international events. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Fraser)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.42)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The most publicised Australian economic problem is the current account deficit and the resulting high overseas debt. We are importing more than we are exporting. Australia is also suffering from high interest rates. The Government has kept interest rates high in order to restrain economic activity, and so reduce imports. However, that is only a short term solution. The only permanent solution is stronger growth of exports. This has been happening during the last four financial years; the volume of exports has grown by a quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must concentrate more attention, though, on the policies which will enhance the dynamism of the economy. That will allow continued growth of employment and improvements in the security of living standards, which are also widely sought economic goals. The dynamism of the economy depends on innumerable aspects of both public and private sector activity. One important area over which the Government has control is public investment; another is research and development. I will make a few comments about both. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few economic relationships about which economists agree is that between investment and economic growth, yet public investment as a proportion of national income is now at the lowest level it has been since the war. Public investment includes public enterprises, especially in the electricity, gas, water, transport and communications industries, and general government, especially roads, education and health. </PARA>
<PARA> Public investment as a proportion of national income peaked in the early fifties at about 10 per cent, and has since declined to little more than half of that. In 1989-90, public gross fixed capital expenditure was 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The largest declines have been in investment by public enterprises. State and local governments undertake most public sector investment and they have also made large reductions in their investment. The Commonwealth exerts considerable financial influence over State and local government spending through direct funding and also through setting limits on their borrowing through the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that Australia's population growth is at its highest level since the early 1970s, the low growth in public investment suggests that either the public infrastructure is being used more efficiently or is being allowed to deteriorate. Both are happening in fact. The public and private sectors are complementary. A decline in public capital stock makes private capital less productive. Conversely, growing public investment leads to growth in private investment by increasing rates of return on private capital. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr David Aschauer has shown that in the United States there is a striking tendency for profits to be higher when the level of public capital formation is high over the course of several years, even after excluding business cycle effects. So there are real risks to Australian productivity from the decline in public investment. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent paper published by the Australian National University Centre for Economic Policy Research and written by Alesina, Gruen and Jones concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>In common with the experiences of Belgium, Sweden and the UK, a disproportionate part of the recent Australian fiscal adjustment-</PARA>
<PARA>they mean by that the cuts in public spending-</PARA>
<PARA>has been at the expense of public investment spending. Cutting public investment spending has serious adverse effects on labour productivity and long-term economic growth. Further, the Australian public sector is now a large net saver (especially when adjustment is made for inflation) and the level of public debt in Australia is low. Therefore, cutting public investment spending is an inappropriate response to an increase in foreign borrowing which is largely funding a private investment boom. </PARA>
<PARA>There is growing public concern about at least some aspects of this decline. Both parties recognised during the recent election campaign the strength of public demand for increased road funding. The neglect of investment in rail is increasingly widely criticised. The inadequacies of the Sydney and Launceston sewerage systems and of the Perth water supply are generally recognised in those cities. Major new investment is required at Sydney Airport. Most Australian cities need ring roads. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the honourable member for his comment. The largest investing enterprise in Australia, Telecom Australia, must continue to rapidly improve its technology, including through the installation of optical fibre and the introduction of the integrated services digital network. And so the examples could be continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A related area of concern is maintenance. Declining public investment is linked with declining spending on maintenance. The worst fears of major Australian infrastructure networks falling apart at the same time are probably unfounded. Many of our infrastructure services and networks compare well with the best in the world, but the avoidance of the problem of the gradual inevitable deterioration of infrastructure needs careful planning, for without adequate maintenance they will deteriorate rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> Maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this century due to the age pattern of Australian infrastructure. Unless funding requirements due to ageing can be offset by savings elsewhere, aggregate public investment must rise. It says something for the managers of public assets that they have been able to maintain public infrastructure with a generally declining share of national resources, but this situation is about to change with increased requirements for rehabilitation and maintenance in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Private investment grew strongly between 1982-1983 and 1988-1989. In 1988-1989 business investment was 13.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). High interest rates caused a reduction in business investment last year, however. The most dramatic growth in the earlier years was in investment for equipment, computers forming a significant part of that. That private investment is vital for the growth of productivity and output, but it will be much less effective unless complemented by essential public investment. Public investment must have a higher priority in budget preparation in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> A second theme on which I would like to make a few comments is the role of technological change and of research and development in increasing the dynamism of the economy. New technology offers opportunities for increasing the cost effectiveness of all investment, yet technological innovation in Australia is lagging behind much of that in the rest of the Western world because of our relatively low level of spending on research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The first report by the Science Council, set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), showed that Australian expenditure on research and development as a proportion of GDP was lower than in any of the other 11 countries listed. We are spending 1.2 per cent compared with Japan, which spends the most on research and development-2.9 per cent of GDP. The Science Council also concluded that the proportion of our research and expenditure on engineering and the natural sciences is particularly low. The Council commented:</PARA>
<PARA>The status of science and technology courses is declining just at the time when the economic, social and environmental futures of Australia are more dependent on science and technology than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA>Many industry and public leaders accept that total research and development in Australia is at less than adequate levels. Industry research and development is a fundamental constraint on Australian economic growth. Most Western countries accept that improved technology is essential to improving productivity. A committee that I chaired on the public infrastructure concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>...that the Government should give high priority to promoting research and development by the CSIRO, universities and other public authorities related to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the provision and management of the public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA>I could make a lot more comments on that but, in order to complete my comments in the time available, I conclude by saying that the permanent elimination of Australia's current account deficit requires a large and permanent increase in our exports of goods and services. To achieve this, both our national infrastructure and our support for research and development must be improved. The latter task has begun; the former must start now. Therefore, I strongly support the comments made last week by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) in his opening address to the Third National Infrastructure Conference. Without increased investment in the public infrastructure, both the relative efficiency and equity of the Australian economy will deteriorate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on an issue which is not debated in this Parliament, that is, the signing of international treaties, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I raise this issue mainly in regard to the process, but also in regard to some of the content because it is only on these occasions that we can get any opportunity to really air this type of issue within the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These treaties can be organised and signed by executive government and the Parliament does not have the opportunity to debate them. I recognise that there are some treaties in which executive government should be involved and which it is inappropriate for the Parliament to debate. Those treaties relate, in particular, to matters of national security. I believe that it is a reasonable position that the Parliament not necessarily debate those issues. However, because of the way in which the Constitution has been interpreted by the High Court in the last decade in particular, I believe that there should be an opportunity for debate in the Parliament of those treaties which have domestic ramifications in this country-clear domestic application. In other words, the process which we have at the present time here in Australia in regard to the signing of international treaties, I believe, is inappropriate; and we ought, as a parliament, to look at that process. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, as many of us realise, there is a cynicism out there in the electorate about the way in which the democratic processes operate in this country. I believe one of the reasons that that does develop in the community is that there are some issues which people believe are vital but which are not debated or publicly aired by having a parliamentary debate. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is one of those. From talking to other members of the Parliament, I believe that there are many people-although very few in my own electorate have approached me over this matter-who are interested in this issue. So I am using this brief period also to highlight some of those issues which I have a concern about in regard to this particular treaty. The most important thing in this area at this stage, I believe, is for us as a parliament to look at the process by which these treaties are dealt with; and I am saying that we should debate them, particularly when they have domestic ramifications. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and there are many excellent proposals in that convention which I fully support. Nevertheless, it does have to be said that, as these conventions are developed and signed and ratified and brought into operation in different countries, they increase the power of the state over the individual. This convention, in particular, does that. In regard to social matters within our nation, I think we have to ask whether extra regulation in these areas is going to develop a more compassionate and more effective society. There is no doubt that there are people, particularly children, in our society who do not get a fair deal and who are not treated fairly and genuinely by their parents or their relatives; and there are young people who, through various circumstances, end up in a destitute position. I do not deny that, but I do question whether the way we ought to be addressing these issues is by having legislation flow from an international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> If we as a country believe that there is a great need to address these issues, we should do it within the parliaments of our country without this overriding type of covenant. I believe that the changed interpretation of the Federal Constitution gives the opportunity to the Federal Parliament to override what was the intended Constitution of Australia. Again, that adds to confusion rather then contributing to the betterment of people in Australia. In the debate that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has suggested we should have over the next 10 years in the lead-up to the year 2001, maybe we should look at the powers which State parliaments have to legislate and at the powers of the Commonwealth. I believe that a tremendous amount of confusion can develop when legislative powers which should remain with the States get taken up by the Federal Parliament; and this is one of them. I do not believe that there is any need for Australia to ratify this treaty for us to address the issues which confront children in this country. If we are deeply and genuinely concerned about the welfare of our young people and if we believe that those needs are out there at the present time, we should be encouraging the State parliamentary arena in this country to make those changes. </PARA>
<PARA> People say that parents' rights in this particular legislation are protected. When one talks to different lawyers, one gets different opinions on this. They often quote article 5 in this regard. But often when the people who are quoting this article say that parents' rights are protected, they do not read out the provisos which are in that article. There are two provisos. For the information of the House and for the people who might be listening to this debate, I will just read this article:</PARA>
<PARA>State parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided by local custom. Legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child to provide-</PARA>
<PARA>and then come the provisos. The first is:</PARA>
<PARA>in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. </PARA>
<PARA>The second is:</PARA>
<PARA>appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the recognised rights in the present convention. </PARA>
<PARA>Who determines what is `in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities'? Ultimately under this covenant as it would develop in legislation in this country no doubt there would be public servants who would determine whether the manner is consistent with the evolving capacities. There is nothing in this proposed covenant that says that the rights, responsibilities and duties of parents are really protected and encouraged. I believe that we have to look at this type of legislation which flows from these sorts of covenants, and that it should be fully debated before we get to the point of ratification of these types of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to one point which I just raised very briefly, that is: will these types of covenants bring about a greater common good for this country? Having looked at this and the type of social legislation which often comes about because governments believe they can determine better than parents overall and generally, I can say that governments fail more than parents. I believe that, as a country, we need to look not only at the legislative obligations which flow from these treaties at the national level, but also at the legislation which is already in place within the States. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to take responsibilities from parents with the assumption that governments are always going to pick them up, we will continue to have more children who will need government support, because parents believe their authority has been undermined by government authorities. We would do far better in this country if we talked about the authority of parents and the responsibility of parents to nurture and to care for their children in a loving atmosphere. We will then get a far more healthy society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House this afternoon a grave miscarriage of justice which has been perpetrated on the people of New South Wales by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in that State, the Hon. Gerald Peacocke. What concerns me greatly is the inactivity on behalf of that Minister to act on information which he has had in his possession for over 12 months on the unsavoury history of a number of companies being operated by a Mr Gary Carter and his associates. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to Mr Peacocke, he appears to be either paralysed from doing anything or unwilling for some other reason that perhaps he does not want known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a very unsavoury history associated with Mr Carter and the companies which, as I have indicated, he does control. It is very difficult to go back through the very complex raft of information which has come into my possession on the companies that he controls to try to follow the paper trail and to get a handle on exactly how exchanges of shares were made through the purchase of preference shares, the selling of those within a two-week period, and the personal gain that has come to Mr Carter to the detriment of the ordinary shareholders-in fact, to get quite to the base of some of the concerns that obviously I am going to raise here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of the sorts of problems I wish to bring to the attention of the House. The first concerns a transaction by ATS Resources Ltd, that is, the Entity Group Ltd, which has been brought to the attention of the general public-the latest occasion being yesterday in the national media in comments made by Mr Hartnell, the new Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, which is to take effect on 1 January next year. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 June 1988 Mr Carter, on behalf of ATS Resources directors, wrote to shareholders seeking the approval of a deal involving the purchase of shares in a group called APA Holdings. That letter was clearly misleading. It said to the people: `Give me the opportunity to buy these shares because it has been cleared by company consultants and there is no benefit to anybody other than you, the shareholders'. That was clearly in breach of legal advice obtained by Mr Carter from Allen, Allen and Hemsley, noted solicitors in Sydney. The whole $20m deal involving preference shares was redeemed within a fortnight of the transaction at the shareholders' meeting which gave approval for that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, and due to the activity of Mr Carter through this particular company and its various offshoots, the former National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) was carrying out a number of investigations. Arising out of those particular investigations were two letters directed to the Business and Consumer Affairs Agency of the New South Wales State Government. I would like to read into Hansard the contents of those letters. In the first, dated 23 May 1989 and directed to Mr B. French, Director of Compliance, Business and Consumer Affairs Agency, Sydney, Mr Schoer, Executive Director of the NCSC, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr French,</PARA>
<PARA>ATS RESOURCES LTD: CARTER, BLAXLAND AND VICKERY</PARA>
<PARA> You are requested to institute proceedings in the name of the National Companies and Securities Commission against Messrs Carter, Blaxland and Vickery in respect of offences committed by them in the course of their directorships of ATS Resources (``ATSR'') from August 1987 until October 1988. The attached memorandum (Annexure A) sets out, in a general way, the matters alleged against those directors. </PARA>
<PARA> The action officer handling this matter at the Commission is Mr David McLennan. He has been directed to make himself available for the purpose of assisting and briefing the officer nominated by you as being responsible for dealing with our request. </PARA>
<PARA> A high priority has been assigned to this task. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA> R.J. Shoer</PARA>
<PARA> Executive Director. </PARA>
<PARA>No action was taken, so on 19 June 1989 a letter, again from the NCSC, again from the Executive Director, Mr Shoer, again to Mr B. French, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my letter of 23 May 1989 requesting that you institute criminal proceedings against certain directors of ATS Resources. At the most recent meeting of the full Commission, the members unanimously reaffirmed the earlier decision to take proceedings in NSW and asked that I write to you to have the matter expedited. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that we have also raised with Mr P. Stepek of your office the prospect of civil proceedings alleging a breach of section 11 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) (NSW) Code and seeking a remedial order. While this may be a way of dealing with one aspect of the general situation more quickly than in the context of a prosecution, it is not regarded by the Commission as a substitute for criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be grateful if you would give a high priority to this request. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA> R.J. Shoer</PARA>
<PARA> Executive Director. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to you and to this House that on 23 May 1989 and 19 June 1989 the Minister directly responsible for this portfolio in New South Wales would have been advised about that advice coming from the NCSC. And what action has been taken since then until now? Absolutely nothing. Despite the fact that the NCSC has said that these transgressions warrant high priority criminal prosecution, Mr Peacocke, is apparently satisfied that a full market disclosure, which is this document in my hand, made by Mr Carter and Entity and other directors, together with measures designed to compensate some minority shareholders in the Entity Group, were sufficient. That is contradicted by the McCusker report into the Rothwells fiasco, which was released a couple of weeks ago. That report clearly states that what Mr Carter and his companies did was for personal gain and to the detriment of the shareholders. So we have damning evidence not only from the NCSC but also from the McCusker report into Rothwells, released very recently, because the money was obtained for Carter from Rothwells. Yet what has the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in New South Wales chosen to do about this? Absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a scandal of monumental proportions because what it does is to throw into consideration what role the New South Wales Government will see for the new Australian Securities Commission when it commences next year. Will it cooperate with Mr Hartnell? As I have already indicated, Mr Hartnell, as reported in the newspapers yesterday, went on to identify a number of high-fliers that would be on his target list. High on that list is the Unity group that Mr Carter owns and that Mr Carter has been involved with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also interesting to see that in recent times Mr Carter has tried to divest his interests in many of these associated companies. He stood down as a chairman of some of them, he has amalgamated others, he has advised the stock exchange of the non-existence of others, and so on- all, however, not necessarily meaning any benefit to minority shareholders or shareholders of his original companies who suffered losses because of the investment decisions that he was making on their behalf, and making those decisions by providing them with false information knowingly and willingly so that the benefit that would flow to the company would flow principally to him and not to the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am today calling on Mr Peacocke to do what the NCSC requested him to do last year, that is, to institute, as a matter of high priority, criminal proceedings against Mr Carter and his associates in the New South Wales court system. If he does not, it throws into whole question once again the cosy relationship that exists between certain members of the New South Wales Government and business operatives in that State. It throws into confusion and uncertainty what role the New South Wales Government will play with the Australian Securities Commission when it is established. We all know, of course, that one of the problems in getting that body established originally was the intransigence on the part of the New South Wales Government in giving up some of its controls, rights and responsibilities in the legal system to get it in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, this is an absolute scandal. It is one that has been known about for over 12 months by the New South Wales Government. As I have indicated, we cannot get it any more plainly stated than by the NCSC or by damning reports that have arisen simply because of this sort of activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House a report which was sponsored by the Country Education Project, the Office of Rural Affairs, and the Victorian Country Youth Affairs Network, and it relates to the Austudy rural inequities. It was completed in March 1990, but was not released until after the 1990 Federal Budget. It is regrettable that the Government chose to take that action because there is a wealth of valuable information in it regarding the inequities for rural students under Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to compliment the members of the research group who prepared this report-Dr Doug Lloyd, the Dean of Education of the Bendigo College of Advanced Education, and Jennifer Sheed, Lecturer at the Faculty of Education, Bendigo College of Advanced Education-for the excellent report which they have produced. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of issues which I want to address, and I want to quote extensively from this report. On page 6 it addresses the impact of Austudy on rural students:</PARA>
<PARA>There is little information available related to the impact Austudy is having on specific groups of students, in particular the impact of Austudy on students from rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Hence, the need for this study. Under `Rural Population Growth' it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Since the 1970s the proportion of persons in rural Victoria has been increasing in relation to Melbourne . . . The fact that the rural population is not declining adds urgency to the task of finding appropriate models for provision of services in rural areas . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things, of course, in this Austudy scheme is the complexity of the arrangements which are put in place and go right back to the Student Assistance Act 1973, which gave birth to the tertiary education assistance scheme (TEAS). Many of those regulations are of great intricacy and much ambiguity. In 1990 Austudy has been further amended so that it now has its own unique set of complex regulations. Of course, that is making it extremely difficult for people to follow the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The sources of Austudy information for Victorian rural students and parents have been difficult to obtain; people are not informed where they can obtain this information. There are two Austudy offices in Victoria-one in Exhibition Street, Melbourne, the other in Dandenong-and a 008 number is provided for people in rural areas. But many people do not realise that the Commonwealth Employment Service offices do have a role of dissemination of information in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Telephone inquiries are quite another thing, and I have a quote here from a parent in northern Victoria in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA> I tried the 008 number, that took 1 hour and 20 minutes to get through, they picked up their receiver but spoke not one word. I held on for 30 minutes during this time not one word from Austudy, someone from their end just hung up. </PARA>
<PARA> I then decided that I would ring for a Telecom operator to connect a reverse charge call-I explained what had occurred. I suggested perhaps there was some fault with my phone. </PARA>
<PARA> It took half an hour for the telephonist to get through, the receiver was picked up and no word spoken, after fifteen minutes a voice said ``Please hold the line'' (no chance for the telephonist to say a word). She held for a further twenty minutes without a word from the other end. The Telecom Operator confessed she had not believed me. She tried the number again and after fifteen minutes got through properly. </PARA>
<PARA>This is just one example of what is happening on that number. The student assistance and secondary schooling aspects of this also can have a dramatic impact on rural families, who can incur two types of cost when their children complete secondary schooling-income forgone and the actual cost involved in having a child attend school. </PARA>
<PARA> The assets test, of course, causes great pain and difficulty for people in rural areas. I want to refer to page 47 of this excellent report, which concerns the introduction of the assets test in 1989. This test is perceived by farmers, in particular, to be inequitable. One parent expressed her frustration. This parent came from the Wimmera and made this quote in 1989. She expressed her frustration with the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned about the assumption that is made that landholders are wealthy-you can't eat dirt and buildings.</PARA>
<PARA>The frustrations keep on coming out. Farmers have assets, but they are tied up in land and stock. Austudy does not take into account that farms need a lot of assets just to function normally. Of course, the problems are related not only to the rural area: this report highlights and points out the inequities which are faced by students who live in remote locations. </PARA>
<PARA> The transition from dependence to independence is very important for students, and in fact it is always a very difficult time. Anyone in this House who has put students through tertiary education of any form will know just how difficult it is. Some young people have a well established attachment to the labour force through working part time for several years while they are doing a course. They have even managed to save money and live either relatively independently or completely independently of parents; yet they are unable to claim independent status for Austudy on the basis of their work history. In fact, trying to help oneself in this situation is not taken into consideration. A student named Jeff, who is a second-year university student, said the following:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it was deceptive from the beginning. My main argument about Austudy is that it deceives a person, especially if you have to move away from home . . . to believe that you can study and also live. </PARA>
<PARA>I now want to return to a brief summary of the main findings and recommendations of this report, because there has been an enormous amount of work put into this document. It is unfortunate that the Government did not choose to have the report made available prior to the 1990 Budget so that the considerations of this report could be taken into hand at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> The summary in the report includes five main issues: access to reliable and accurate information about Austudy; the adequacy of the living away from home allowance; the impact of Austudy on secondary school retention rates; the assets test; the transition from dependence to independence for young people; and assumptions made by Austudy about that transition. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go through all of the recommendations but, regrettably, time is against me. I do commend this report and I think that it is well summed up on the cover. It indicates that it is about Austudy rural inequities, a joint project of the Country Education Project, the Office of Rural Affairs and the Victorian Country Youth Affairs Network, funded by the Federal Government. There is an illustration of four young people looking extremely worried about Austudy, and the caption reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as honourable members will be enviously aware, I represent the finest city in the Southern Hemisphere. My electorate contains the central business district and most of its great cultural and commercial monuments. These range from botanic gardens to the stock exchange and from art galleries to the zoo. For the most part, government should leave these great institutions to get on with their job, but from time to time they deserve our chastisement or encouragement; and today I would like to draw the attention of the House to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and to the Constitutional Museum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABC's State headquarters sit in the middle of my electorate, barely a mile from where I live. I frequented it earlier as an academic commentator and I now go there as a local member; and I know that it contains some very good people. However, there is some monkey business afoot at the ABC, or rather there is no more monkey business afoot at the ABC. The ABC has gone bananas and axed Tickle Pot and sacked both its producer and its production assistant.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those culturally deprived members-and I see that the honourable member is not one-who missed out on the joys of Tickle Pot, allow me to explain. Tickle Pot was a 10-minute radio program broadcast daily by Radio National to an Australia-wide audience of 3- to 7-year-olds. It starred Australia's best selling and most popular children's singer and songwriter, Peter Combe, and his mouse mate, Monkey. It was a mixture of music, comedy, fantasy and madness built around subtle educational themes promoting positive social values. It was a winning formula and it was the only program on Australian radio for that age group.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NT4">Dr CATLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely true. Over the past 2 1/2 years, as the honourable member points out, over 400 programs have been recorded and the Tickle Pot success in reaching its target audience has been unprecedented. The Tickle Pot crew have received over 25,000 drawings and letters from children, parents and teachers, proving it was a very highly successful family and classroom listening experience. The recently started Tickle Pot fan club already has 5,000 members. Now, these Ticklepotters ring up the production office in tears wanting to know where Peter and Monkey have gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The program was even generating income for the ABC, in terms of sales of cassettes and books and the enormous success of the live Tickle Pot concerts. Indeed, ABC enterprises are demonstrating their faith in the popularity of Tickle Pot by releasing a Tickle Pot book and a record of Monkey songs even after the axing of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of Tickle Pot was not only in Australian terms; it was also hailed by its professional peers around the world. Tickle Pot won the 1988 Peter Gold award for the best children's radio program in the world; in 1989 it capped this by winning the gold medal at the International Radio Festival in New York for the best educational children's radio program in the world; and in 1990 it won the bronze medal at the same festival in the children's-young adults section. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the United Kingdom broadcast a series of episodes of Tickle Pot in 1989 and was so delighted with it that it has since made many unsuccessful attempts to imitate the inimitable Tickle Pot format. It has now given up and is soon going to repeat the original Australian series. </PARA>
<PARA> The producer of Tickle Pot, Heather Steen, who is a friend of mine and a South Australian and Adelaide resident, was awarded a Churchill Fellowship for her work in children's radio and was invited to assist the BBC in setting up a new station-Radio 5-which will consist primarily of programs for the children: a whole radio station. It was while Heather Steen was so engaged that the ABC axed Tickle Pot and made her redundant. So we have this splendid irony, Mr Deputy Speaker. But while the BBC was setting up a new children's radio station in England, with assistance from the ABC, the ABC axed all its children's radio programs in Australia. Scandalous! There are no programs for children broadcast on the ABC radio at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> There are approximately 1.4 million children in Australia between the ages of three and seven. This means that, at a rate of 8c a day, which we are all told is the current cost of the ABC, these children contribute nearly $41m a year to the ABC. `That ain't peanuts', says Monkey, who claims that he was only paid peanuts by the ABC, anyway. What does the ABC do with $41m worth of children's money? It cuts their radio programs to zero. And what does the ABC's radio charter have to say about that? I will quote it:</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation shall take account of . . . the provision of broadcasting programs and television programs of an educational nature. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that that does not specifically mention children, but Mr David Hill, who is usually a very sensible person, although he is with the North Sydney rugby league crowd, writes in a document called The ABC of Literacy:</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC, with its national television and radio networks, and a comprehensive range of educational services for people of all ages, is uniquely placed to help. </PARA>
<PARA>A clear contradiction. We all know that when there is a shortfall of funds programs have to be axed and cuts have to be made. But is it fair, right or honourable to start by attacking an audience group which cannot defend itself, which cannot fill out rating books and which is grotesquely underserviced anyway by the general national media?</PARA>
<PARA> Do we really want a uniquely Australian culture for our children or are we prepared to throw them away to the teenage mutant ninja turtles? As more than 2,000 children and their parents chanted at a recent Tickle Pot protest concert, `What do we want? Tickle Pot. When do we want it? Now'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the other hand, the Constitutional Museum on North Terrace, again in my seat, offers some positive lessons of which I was reminded only this morning when passing Canberra's old Parliament House. Why is nothing happening to the old Parliament House, in which I used to work for a number of Ministers in the old days? A great national asset is there lying idle with its future in doubt, and I have received no information on what has happened to the plans by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories to do something about it. So I would like to make some suggestions in this grievance debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An excellent example of what to do with such a facility already exists in Adelaide, where the old State Parliament House has been turned into a very successful model that Canberra could adopt. The building's basic use is as a museum of political history, although there are many other rooms which also serve other purposes. The old members' refreshment room has become a restaurant open to the public. This means that the public and politicians from the neighbouring State Parliament House can partake of excellent bistro-style cuisine. The old Parliamentary library has become a specialist library and research centre, but it is also available for public use. It has touch screen computer technology which visitors can use to punch up information about their local members, their local Ministers or other political matters. The old House of Assembly chamber has a sound and light show to explain its history. Other rooms and the garden are popular venues for meetings and receptions of various kinds and in fact I spent my fortieth birthday evening there at an exhibition commemorating the opposition to the war in Vietnam, so foolishly waged by the political parties now in Opposition. Recent shows have also included one on the role of women in the political history of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> These imaginative uses, if adopted in Canberra, would provide excellent guided public access to an important historic site and also bring in some income to offset running costs. The old Parliament House in Adelaide in fact holds a valuable collection of documents pertaining to the opening of the first Federal Parliament in 1901, and it considers that it is holding them only until such time as the much needed museum of Federal politics comes into being. The centenary of the Federation of 1901 might be the perfect official opening date and, at our present rate of progress, it might be a suitable one.</PARA>
<PARA> Australians are delighted that we have got back an original copy of the national Constitution and that it is going to be located here. But it is important to put it somewhere where it is accessible and is in context, that is, surrounded by an interpretive display which reveals it for what it was and is-a compromise between the different political interests of the 1890s, a living document still adapting itself as times change, and a legal framework which has an impact on the daily lives of Australians. As we now go into a process of reforming that Constitution in the 1990s, such a display could be augmented by appropriate contemporary documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Susan Tonkin, a constituent of mine, Mr Deputy Speaker, and Director of South Australia's Constitutional Museum, assures me of her readiness to advise on the creation of such a national equivalent, and I only hope that her offer will be taken up. And I should close by pointing out that once again this confirms that Adelaide is more than just a nice place to have lunch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I enjoyed the contribution of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), and I certainly agree with him on the axing of the children's programs on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. However, due to the policies of this Government, Australia unfortunately is moving into a recession, joblessness at present is skyrocketing and country areas particularly are being hard hit. We have got record interest rates; a record level of the Australian dollar in recent times; record costs through inflation; and, compared with the rest of the world, and on top of this, commodity prices are down, particularly in the wool industry and the wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With this basis I would like to speak this afternoon about the importance of restoring the live sheep trade to the Middle East, acknowledging of course that Iraq and Kuwait have to be removed from the equation for the time being. At the height of this trade a couple of years ago we were exporting some seven million sheep to this part of the world. When we think of it, that is about one-third the number presently being mooted as the number that we might have to move into in our slaughter program, if we go ahead with it, to get rid of our oversupply of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government could be doing much more in restoring this live sheep trade, or at the very least attempting to do something. The fiasco in this area has dragged on for far too long and is long overdue for some concentrated attention from the Government. It appears that the Government does not know what to do. The Government is moribund on this issue and, in fact, the Government cannot even begin to understand what to do on the issue. I will admit that it is a very complex area, but certain actions of the Government, far from helping the situation, seem to be aggravating the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that there is no one magical answer that will restore the live sheep trade overnight. However, a number of steps, I believe, could be taken by the Government, which could also help by modifying its behaviour in other areas. One of these, I believe, centres around the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I believe he should become fully briefed on this situation. I have mentioned the Prime Minister because the situation encompasses several portfolios, Primary Industries and Energy, Foreign Affairs, and Trade Negotiations, just to mention three. The Prime Minister himself does not seem particularly interested, unfortunately, in the live sheep trade. He seems more intent on trying to get the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) up over our Treasurer (Mr Keating) as his successor. </PARA>
<PARA> We particularly need, I believe, closer consultation between the Government and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC). I believe the Government should offer every assistance possible to it so that it can re-establish as soon as possible a warm and genuine link between itself and the Middle East, which has been somewhat lacking in present times. I believe more top class information should be coming through from the Foreign Affairs and Trade Negotiations portfolios to the AMLC and that top priority must be given to repairing the damage that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular I want to mention one incident: the withdrawal of the licence of the Al Mukarrish Co. by the AMLC. I believe this particular incident needs thorough analysis and I would urge the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) to take up my suggestion. I know that this company sailed into Saudi Arabia with a load of live sheep at the very time when we had a ban on live sheep going to that country because it had been turning our boats away. There is no doubt that this company committed a clear breach of policy. Nevertheless, I believe it now should be looked at again. Saudi Arabia, when all is said and done, is our biggest customer for live sheep-it takes 50 per cent or more of what we send out of this country-and the Al Mukarrish Co. was the biggest operator into Saudi Arabia, with 25 per cent of that trade. But the AMLC has taken the attitude that that is it, the company is finished. Even if it reapplied for a licence, I do not think that the AMLC would be all too enamoured to grant it one. The AMLC has taken the attitude that other companies will take up the shortfall, but I put it to the Corporation that this has not happened. To some extent, in fact, New Zealand has taken up the shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the trade has resumed and a ship has left Australia and is sailing over there now, but whether that will be accepted or whether ships will continue to be accepted is very much up in the air. I realise that health and proper age protocols have been put in place, and I acknowledge the importance of those and the work that has been done in that area, but that is not the full story on why our sheep are not getting out of this country to the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Al Mukarrish Co. operator came from a high-born Saudi Arabian family and the connections he had in that country, I think, were vital; we should recognise that. That company never had a ship stopped, to my knowledge; it always paid promptly and in its own way it indirectly helped other shipments get in there. I think that the time has come to admit that perhaps we have cut off our nose to spite our face and that it is not just a matter of that company reapplying for a licence. We must realise the cultural differences between us: if something like a licence is taken away, it is regarded as a grave slight. If we had suspended the company for a time and had had a revision at the end of a proper period, that might have been acceptable; but to take the licence away willy-nilly, I think, is in the long run going to do us in Australia, particularly the growers, of course, more harm than good, and it has substantial flow on effects which we are witnessing today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are sensitivities here in understanding how the Middle East mind works which are not even being considered, and I believe bridges must be rebuilt. It is too big an issue for personalities and ego and pride to come into. </PARA>
<PARA> In another area, I believe the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should look at revamping its Middle East section. I believe the performance of Senator Evans and the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) has been abysmal. They have neglected the Middle East almost totally. They show indifference to that part of the world. Some people are saying that we have less than the most effective teams of diplomats and advisers over there. I believe that both Ministers should give priority to this area. Personality clashes between our key players and important people over there such as the Saudi Arabian Primary Industry Minister, Dr Abdul Al Shaikh, I believe, are intolerable. I do not mean in any way to denigrate the efforts of staff over there, but I believe our Government must monitor more fully what is happening there and make sure that the people who go there are genuinely interested in the area, give attention to the customs of that area and are able to develop positive relations with trade contacts over there. </PARA>
<PARA> Our approach perhaps should be more akin to that of Great Britain. Even though that country makes the odd mistake, it specialises in and cultivates the Middle East in a thoroughly professional manner. I believe attention must be given to the observance of even the most basic customs and cultural procedures, because these are being constantly violated. Incidents like the appointment of a woman to a high diplomatic position do not necessarily go down well in the Middle East, nor does having our Prime Minister, who is regarded over there as an infidel, writing directly to the King in an ill-advised and naive attempt to resolve the live sheep issue. Such actions usually end up doing more harm than good. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we should be monitoring press articles more closely over there than we are and, if incorrect and adverse comment comes on Australia or on the quality of our sheep or other primary products that we are trying to send in there, then we should have immediate balancing replies prepared and submitted to those newspapers. With the relationships we build up with them, we should have a good chance of having them being submitted, because this sort of damaging thing has happened in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Prime Minister, when he makes his pro-Israeli statements, should perhaps curb them to some extent, because they are invariably reported right throughout the Middle East and he is painted over there as strongly pro-Zionist. I am not suggesting that he should change his opinion, for which I have some sympathy, or that he should remain mute. However, he should not be ignorant of the consequences of these statements and should temper them accordingly and perhaps occasionally say something positive about Saudi Arabia, which is a very fine country. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is very complex, I admit. It has many facets to it. There are vast cultural differences to be acknowledged and there are other factors, such as the expatriates over there being fewer in numbers than they were and less meat being eaten. But I despair that we can really restore good government to government relations while this present Government is in power, and that is desperately needed. At the very least, the private industries and individuals should be allowed to get on with the job. The Government should give them every support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the decision last year to decommission the 12th Squadron at Amberley Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base and mothball the Chinook helicopters, many misinformed and incorrect statements have been made by those opposite to gain media attention. Nothing was more blatant than recent comments by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who was obviously using the opportunity for blatant political grandstanding. Unfortunately, this was done on the fiftieth anniversary of the first RAAF plane actually landing at Amberley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer honourable members specifically to comments made by the honourable member for Ryan during the parliamentary recess in regard to the RAAF's Chinook helicopters, which are presently stored at Amberley. In a media release on 3 July the honourable member for Ryan claimed that the Australian taxpayers are paying some $6,000 a month to keep the 11 Chinook helicopters mothballed at Amberley. The media release went on to claim that in the last year alone the Chinooks cost taxpayers some $70,000 while they sat idle during Queensland's horrific floods. It is very emotional stuff, but the facts just were not there. Setting in place the necessary equipment to keep the Chinooks operational has larger up-front costs which prove more cost effective over time. Dividing the annual operating costs for the first year by the number of months and adding on an inflated amount for the maintenance of spare parts hardly presents a true indication of the true costs of running the equipment. The honourable member for Ryan's sensational comments certainly caught the attention of the local media and, instead of big headlines about the celebrations coming forth on that day, 4 July, it said something like: `The idle Chinooks hit taxpayers'. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the claims were quite incorrect. The claim was made that a cost of $6,000 a month indicates that there was a daily operating cost of some $200. In actual fact, the daily operating cost is less than $10-quite a substantial difference. The honourable member for Ryan seems to have discarded the No. 1 economic rule for marginal cost analysis in one move. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the emotional retorts of the honourable member, the Government has undertaken a review looking at a range of options, the final outcome of which was announced by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) early last month. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan has not been on his own in this sort of criticism. Senator Bjelke-Petersen and Senator MacGibbon also joined in this opportunity, from time to time, to criticise the decisions of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that the primary role of the Air Force, and all defence forces, is to look after the defence of the nation. We often hear of criticisms that suggest that we should be using our military operations for civilian duties. Whilst it is always very good to use those things, the primary role of our Defence Force, of course, is defence. I think we should be very careful in thinking that there is any other reason for using it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a very proud record in looking after our defence people and I think that our defence people at Amberley were particularly disappointed that the opportunity was taken on such an important celebration as the fiftieth anniversary at Amberley for members of the Opposition to do some political grandstanding. I would ask honourable members opposite in future to really think twice about making these statements that tend, in a lot of cases, to offend the hardworking people in our defence forces, for whom I certainly have a very high regard, as I know do other members on this side of the Parliament. The Government has helped our defence forces in many ways, including housing and such things as FIND, which is an area of information for defence people when they move into new areas. I think there have been very innovative ideas that this Government has brought forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, students from the Mountain District Christian School in Belgrave Heights in my electorate have expressed their disapproval of the removal of Caroline Chisholm from the $5 note. Caroline Chisholm is one of Australia's most famous women and has graced the face of our blackberry coloured $5 note since its introduction in 1967. She was one of the first pioneers of this great country, who helped and assisted other young women emigrate to what was then the colony of New South Wales. The fact that Caroline Chisholm was put on our first $5 note was recognition of her contribution to Australia and the more general acknowledgment of the pioneering spirit of our early women settlers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my view that she should remain on our currency as a reminder of the women pioneers who stood alongside their husbands, kept their families together through thick and thin, and helped make this country what it is today. Perhaps it is an indictment of the officials who make these decisions that, because the notes will now be made of a more durable material, an Australian woman pioneer should be declared obsolete. Without the pioneering spirit of women such as Elizabeth McArthur, Louisa Lawson and Caroline Chisholm, Australian history would be the poorer. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that it was not fashionable for women to accept the kudos for the work that they did in those very early days, but surely we do not need to perpetuate that farce today. I urge the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to ask the Reserve Bank to reconsider this retrograde step and restore Caroline Chisholm to the face of our new plastic $5 note. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On last Monday night the South Australian National Football League 1990 Magarey Medal count was conducted for the best and fairest player. Being the member for Port Adelaide and the Vice-President of the Port Adelaide Football Club, I was pleased to see one of our players, full-forward Scott Hodges, take out this prestigious award. In doing so, Scott Hodges became the twelfth Magarey medallist from Port Adelaide, for a total of 16 medals since it was first awarded, and shares this honour with such Port Adelaide former greats as Bob Quinn, who won two medals, Geoff Mottley, Russell Ebert, who won four, Trevor Obst and Dave Boyd. A great honour indeed, and congratulations from all the people in Port Adelaide to Scott Hodges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Port Adelaide has received a great deal of media coverage from the major football States of Australia, suggesting that the club is being somewhat embattled. From my own point of view, it was such delicious, sweet irony that not only did Scott Hodges win the Magarey Medal, but another Port Adelaide player, Simon Tregenza, was runner-up and the club was far ahead of any other club as the leader in the total votes counted. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the predictions, Mr Speaker, that I made when I first came into this Parliament was that Port Adelaide would win the next three premierships. We have already won 1988 and 1989 and, by finishing as minor premiers this year, Port Adelaide are at shorter odds than Phar Lap to complete the trifecta. Port Adelaide has a great tradition, and I believe it is this tradition which has attracted the Australian Football League to Port Adelaide, putting the club in a strong position to enter into our national competition next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have got only 90 seconds to speak, so I will step on the gas. I am absolutely astounded at the price of petrol-80c a litre it will be shortly. Let me talk in the old terms of a gallon of petrol. That works out to nearly $3.20 a gallon, and I think of those poor people in my electorate. Talk about social justice! Some of the pensioners in my electorate of Franklin have some of the older cars that use a lot of petrol. It is costing them $3.20 a day to come to work. It has just gone to the impossible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me talk also about liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). I notice that the greenies always talk about the birds and the bees and the poor truckies and the forest workers and so forth, but they never talk about LPG, which is an alternative to petrol, which is non-polluting, and which can be used in a converted motor car. A motor car can be driven on LPG efficiently. It will save engine wear, it is cheaper and it could be used as an alternative if governments had a bit of foresight and decided to give tax reductions to people that converted to LPG. Let me talk about the price of LPG in Australia. It is outrageous also. In Tasmania, it is twice the price in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk about the Prices Surveillance Authority. I think that is a toothless tiger, and when we become the Government of Australia we will get rid of that and we may bring a bit of sanity into the petrol pricing structure of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert Jeppeson, a hero who has left an indelible mark on the history of the western Queensland town of Longreach and on the lives of 13 people. Tragedy struck in Longreach in the early hours of Wednesday, 5 September, when fire completely destroyed the 75-year-old Commercial Hotel and five other businesses. Fourteen people were in the hotel at the time and 13 of them owe their lives to the one man who did not make it. Robert Jeppeson, a 38-year-old man from Enoggera in Brisbane, displayed a commitment to the welfare of other people that serves as an example to us all. Tragically, in helping others, he lost his life. A major in the Army Reserve, Mr Jeppeson was in Longreach to investigate future military exercise sites in western Queensland and was staying at the Commercial Hotel on the night of the fire. It was he who first became aware that the building was ablaze and, instead of just moving himself to safety, raised the alarm and helped the other guests to escape.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After getting the others to safety, Robert ran back into the building to ensure that no one was left, but the building collapsed. His wife, Fay, has every right to claim he died a hero and his two children, Kelly and Cameron, can be very proud of their dad. However, this knowledge alone will not alleviate their grief and struggle over the next few months and years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that people like Robert Jeppeson who give their lives in the service of others receive due public recognition and that their loved ones are not just left to fend for themselves. I fully support the actions of the Longreach Shire Council in launching an appeal for Fay, Kelly and Cameron and congratulate it on such a quick and thoughtful response. I know that the people of western Queensland will not forget Robert Jeppeson or his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have received the following letter from a constituent:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am on a supporting parent benefit, I have two sons at tech, and I live in a Ministry of Housing house. After 7 months of serious job hunting and a six week course in March/April, last week I started part-time work three hours each Friday and Saturday night as a kitchen hand. I was really pleased when I picked up my pay. I had earned $64.14. I first went to Social Security and advised them. After 15 weeks I will lose $2 a week off my pension. Next to the Ministry of Housing. They can't do anything until after four weeks of pay. My rent would go up immediately so therefore in four weeks I am behind in my rent. I asked could they indicate how much the rise would be-$17.60 per week, which means before they do anything I am already $70.40 in arrears with my rent. I go to the Taxation Office to inquire should I have tax taken out of my pension now I am employed. Yes-$15.50 per week. To summarise, I am earning $64.14; I lose $35.10, and I am better off by $29.04 per week. Therefore, I am losing more than I am gaining. We are encouraged to find work and we are expected to be honest with authorities but after this I am not surprised people don't bother working, or if they do, they don't declare it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, nothing better indicates that the present policies of taxation and social security restrict people's ability to get out of the welfare regime. I now ask the responsible Minister to review these issues. </PARA>

What will happen to other sides in the South Australian league if the composite option is taken is that their supporter base will be halved and will follow the composite side and their local club will be destroyed. The Western Australian experience should give great strength to the argument that a club, either Norwood or Port Adelaide-and at this stage it will be Port Adelaide-should be in the Australian Football League. Port Adelaide will make a great contribution, and perhaps will be the first black and white club in a long time to win a premiership in the AFL.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I draw the attention of the House to the impact being created in my electorate by the Government's high interest rate policy. The electorate of Bendigo has lost more than 2,500 jobs since 1983 under the Hawke-Keating Labor Government in both public and private sector activity. There have been cutbacks in State government departments and also in the Federal area. That tally is growing day by day. The most recent losses are at Pacific Textiles, a carpet yarn manufacturer, which unfortunately had to put off 28 people in the past month; Humes Pipes lost seven employees in the past month; and more than 80 retail shops are now vacant in the Bendigo area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one asks people for the reason for all this, they say that it is high interest rates, lack of sales, and a drop-off in demand and confidence. The housing and building construction industry has ground to a halt. There have been many job losses in that industry and nothing to replace them with. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) should get out and find out what is happening in country Victoria and talk to Senator Button, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has visited my electorate. When asked what he could do to help, he said he had no ideas to offer. What they need to do, Mr Speaker, is to get out and find out what is happening in rural Australia. It is going backwards under the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday of this week, I received a letter from a firm of solicitors, Dunhill Madden Butler, signed by a Mr A. Elder. In his letter, Mr Elder indicates that he is acting on behalf of Mr Bill Farrow, the major partner in the Farrow Corporation and a director in the Pyramid Building Society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter contains paragraphs which I believe would inhibit me in the passage of my duties as a member of this Parliament and as a representative of the Corio electorate. The House will be aware that the Pyramid Building Society was a major institution in the Geelong area and that some 76,000 persons in the Geelong area held deposits in the Society. Clearly, it is a matter of serious consequence to all persons, and particularly parliamentary representatives of that area. </PARA>
<PARA> My duty as a member of parliament is to represent the views of those people, and I believe any action which would inhibit me from doing so would deny the people I represent and this Parliament their proper role in what is a matter of significant and major public comment and public administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to the specific paragraph, which asks me to pre-empt my right to any future comment on these matters, even though anyone who has taken an interest in them would know that I have a series of questions on the Notice Paper, I should have thought not unfriendly to the views being expressed by Mr Farrow. The paragraph refers to a document which I distributed to branch members of my Party in my electorate and to the Secretary of the Geelong Trades Hall Council-that being, for the information of honourable members, something under 200 copies by private letter. It was not released by me to the press and it was not published or commented on by me in any media release or in any other fashion. The letter that I received, which is posed in a very courteous fashion-and I acknowledge that-states:</PARA>
<PARA>I ask you not to distribute the document further, to tell the people to whom you have distributed it that it should be put to one side, and that you refrain from making such statements in future. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the last part of that sentence, that I 'refrain from making statements in future'. Anyone who reads the Notice Paper will know that I have questions which, once answered, whether they are in favour of or detrimental to the Government, it would be impossible, as a member of parliament, for me not to comment on. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports on the activities of Pyramid will be coming out over a period of time and, as the representative of the Corio electorate, it will be my responsibility to make comment on the matter, particularly on behalf of those people who have lost their funds, who are shareholders and who have been deprived. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no animosity towards Mr Farrow and I do not think that at any time during the 20-odd years that I have known him or been a member of this Parliament we have had any altercation other than a letter once about what I thought was an improper action in reducing some interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put certain documents before the House for the consideration of the Privileges Committee. It is possible from my knowledge of privilege that the particular matter is not covered because privilege was, in fact, derived in the eighteenth century and some of the present legal practices were not paramount in those days. I seek leave to table a letter from Dunhill Madden Butler which contains the paragraphs which I find offensive; an attachment to that letter which purports to answer matters which I raised in the circular which I sent out and which, had I not been told I could not distribute, I would have sent to my electorate because it is entitled to know those views too; the letter that was actually sent to the branch members, and the attachment; the report published of the administrator of the Pyramid Building Society which sets out his views of the operation of the Society; a series of press releases which were published prior to the making of my statement, which have a total distribution of something in excess of two million, and against none of whom writs have been issued or action taken, clearly indicating that the action threatened against me is to prevent me, as a member of parliament, from taking part in public debate, not a matter of damage, because these articles are far more damaging and potentially damaging to Mr Farrow; finally, a list of members of parliament which was issued by the Friends of Pyramid Building Society which clearly puts my name at the top of that list-the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) is second-on a matter which normally would have been of State importance, but which, I think, reflects the importance which is placed on my contribution and my participation in a matter which is of significant importance to my electorate and the people I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I claim, Mr Speaker, that the threat contained in the letter, if I were to comply with it, would inhibit me and prevent me in future from carrying out my duties as a member of this Parliament and thus would prevent this Parliament from having my services on a basis which I would think is right and proper. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his deep and abiding interest in the crucial issue of improving skills within this country. The House has often heard the Prime Minister and even me refer to the great success that the Government has had in increasing participation rates, particularly in our schools and also within our universities, and it has been wider even than that. But Australia has lagged, and to some extent continues to lag, behind some parts of the world in the area of our concentration on vocational education. Something like 30,000 of our young people leave school and enter the work force without any additional vocational preparation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, this is quite out of line with what happens in many other parts of the world. In West Germany, for example, 63 per cent of people in the age group 25 to 34 have a post-year 12 qualification other than one which they have gained at a university-in other words, 63 per cent have a qualification which we in Australia would broadly describe as a vocational qualification-whereas in Australia the comparable figure is only 37 per cent. This area has been of considerable concern to us in the Government and, indeed, to some of our colleagues in the States.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to give the impression that nothing has happened. If we look at technical and further education (TAFE) enrolments, we find that over the last few years the number of student places in the preparatory and vocational courses has increased by 21 per cent or an additional 166,000 student places. We also find that there has been more than a doubling of the number of intakes for apprenticeships and traineeships since the time we came to office. That is, another 37,000 young Australians have engaged in apprenticeships or traineeships since the time we came to office.</PARA>
<PARA> But a number of issues still have to be contended with and we need to work on a number of problems. Even in this Budget, where we have continued our restraint in relation to expenditure, we find that we have continued to maintain, and in some areas increase substantially, Commonwealth expenditure in areas such as TAFE funding, where we will now be spending something like twice as much as the States are spending on capital, and in other areas where we are encouraging industry training efforts.</PARA>
<PARA> But I think the area of vocational training, as the question implies, is not just a matter for governments, whether State or Federal. It is a matter for our joining together with industry-both employers and unions-to ensure that we can have a coordinated approach to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> If we thought about the question of skill formation we would imagine that most employers would take it as being axiomatic that if they wanted to improve the performance of their businesses they would invest significantly in the formation and improving of the skills of their work force generally. Unfortunately, in Australia there has not been a strong tradition of industry investing in training. We have found that as soon as there is even the suggestion of a downturn in economic activity one of the first casualties is the area of apprenticeship intakes and other areas of training expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that the Government decided to introduce the training guarantee to ensure that all employers spend at least something on their training efforts rather than having a continuation of a situation where some 60 per cent of employers spend absolutely nothing on training.</PARA>
<PARA> We think that as a result of that measure and the other measures that we are taking we will be able to change the views and the culture of industry. We want to do that in a cooperative way and hence we are having, and will continue to have, very detailed discussions with industry and with the unions. This problem is one of the consequences of having an industry in Australia which was so protected from the forces of international competition that issues of quality which go to the questions of training and skill development were ignored by Australian industry. Again we find that it is the Government which is setting the pace in this area.</PARA>

It knows a lot about discouraging that kind of activity; it knows nothing and has said nothing about how we might improve this in the future. All it does is resort to its simplistic slogan that all that needs to be done is deregulate the labour market when, in fact, there is enough evidence to suggest that if one did deregulate the labour market in the way that the Opposition intends it would have an entirely contradictory effect in terms of improving the development of skills in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least I am competent enough to answer it, which is more than most members of the Opposition are about the subjects they have been given charge of. The rationale for the Minister's proposition is that in facing an entrenched monopoly, which is what Telecom Australia is, a competitor should be able to devise a corporate strategy to develop a competitive operation against the monopoly. Therefore, he reasons that this will take some time. It is upon examination of the progress of the duopolist that decisions will then need to be made as to how much time should be either permitted or extended to the duopolist, if any. It is the Government's intention over the longer haul to see that there is a competitive framework. That may well extend beyond a simple duopoly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this simple point in observation: the duopolies which the coalition constructed, particularly with the airlines, were duopolies which had a certain tenure. They were then reviewed and it decided to extend them for a number of years. I think they were for five or seven years duration. Such a review will be part and parcel of the process of telecommunications reform envisaged by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The point I made yesterday was that we are being asked about a competitive framework built around, in the first instance, a duopoly by a party which specialised in monopolies or very extended duopolies. I note that one empty-headed member opposite is rattling his head again. How can he refute that fact? Those opposite were specialists at monopolies. A lot of the competitive inhibitions in this economy and much of the monopolisation of the economy are their legacies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Phillip for her question. I was recently in the electorate of Phillip, in the city of Waverley, where a very enthusiastic meeting endorsed the extension of a job link program in that city. What struck me about that occasion was the recognition on the part of people working in the area of disability of the enormous strides that had been made by this Government, particularly with regard to the Disability Services Act. If there were an area in which the Government conceptually had broken new ground-and it ought to be very strongly supported by every member of this House-it was in the area of the Disability Services Act and the new, more active approach that the Government has been pursuing in this area-against, I might say, quite strong resistance from conservative groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Phillip and to other members that the Government intends to go on in the direction that has been set. In the Budget this year we have seen a very strong confirmation of that continued direction and the resources that are necessary to make a very great success of what is an intractable problem.</PARA>
<PARA> More specifically, in terms of what the honourable member said, I confirm that the Government this year has carried out its commitments to this point. On top of the additional places that we have been putting on-stream, we have carried out a major evaluation of the attendant care scheme, which, together with the 325 scheme, has been of great assistance to people with severe disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, the attendant care scheme, as honourable members will be aware, means that people from institutions are able to move into the community and lead independent lives with attendant care. On the other hand, the 325 scheme means that people who are in the community but who could live more fulfilling and sustaining lives get additional assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Both of those schemes have been the subject of a major evaluation. I say to all honourable members that that evaluation has been extraordinarily promising. People have been able to live within the community with greater independence, with greater quality of life, and with a great deal more satisfaction for themselves at less cost to the taxpayer. By innovation and creativity we have shown that people who have lived very limited lives are able to live much fuller lives in the community at less cost overall. That is fully in line with the disability services legislation and it is a very clear case where individual people are able to experience enormous joy in living whereas before there was a great sense of restriction.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget, as honourable members will know, the Government has made decisions that indicate we are moving to expand both of these schemes. We will put into place 200 additional care places with respect to attendant care and 350 additional support places for the 325 scheme. There will be 550 additional places in total.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Government has made a significant commitment to this program. This expansion involves additional expenditure of $32m-a not insubstantial amount of money. The program will provide these people with a much greater quality of life. Compared with the alternatives, it will be an extremely cost effective program and the improvements will result from the evaluation undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> One can understand why the city of Waverley, for example, in the honourable member's electorate, would so enthusiastically support attendant care and innovative disability programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Certainly, the remarks of Senator Walsh have been brought to my attention. Let me say that Senator Walsh is speaking for himself, not for the Government, and I entirely repudiate his sentiments. The Commonwealth is happy to support the Victorian bid for the Olympic Games. I will indeed be proud to be a member of the bid team visiting Tokyo next week for the meeting of the International Olympic Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I welcome the fact that this, again, is an issue on which there is no difference across the Parliament. I welcome the unequivocal support that has been given consistently by the Opposition to the Government's position on this matter. I welcome very much the fact that the Leader of the Opposition will also be in Tokyo playing his part in trying to win the votes for Melbourne. I feel certain that on its merits, Melbourne's bid stands an excellent chance of success.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to some of the matters that Senator Walsh has mentioned. In January of this year my Government agreed to the request of the Premier of Victoria to provide $125m, to be indexed in 1990 prices, towards the construction of a world standard sporting complex at Albert Park should Melbourne be successful. As I understand the position, in that decision the Government has the complete support of the Opposition. I do not think there has been any opposition to that. Indeed, there has been support.</PARA>
<PARA> That will be a major new facility. That decision was taken following the investigation of an interdepartmental committee made up of representatives of the Department of Finance and Australian Construction Services which reported on the Victorian estimates. Subsequently, the committee reported that the cost estimates were reasonable, given the scope of the project. Should the Melbourne bid be successful, I am confident that the trade unions will respond positively.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House the facts. Early in September an agreement was signed between the Victorian State Government, the Trades Hall Council, the building industry unions and employer groups. That was done to ensure that the planned facilities are built on time and within budget. The agreement signed by all those parties pledged the parties to abide by the disputes settlement procedures laid down under the Victorian building industry agreement. Those are facts.</PARA>
<PARA> For one who purports to pride himself on his intellectual astringency, Senator Walsh never lets a few facts get in the way of his well developed prejudices. On its merits, the Melbourne bid deserves to succeed. If it does succeed, it will be of very significant economic benefit for the whole of Australia. If the bid does succeed next Tuesday night, I believe that that will be reason for the overwhelming majority of Australians to have a legitimate cause for celebration. Let it be, for Senator Walsh, another excuse to drown his bitter sorrows.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to the huge losses incurred by the State Bank of Victoria and Tricontinental Corporation Ltd and to the Treasurer's statement on 28 August that the Commonwealth was `not the supervisor' of the State Bank of Victoria. I ask the Treasurer: Is it not the case that, as claimed by the then Victorian Treasurer, Rob Jolly, for some years prior to 23 February 1990 an informal arrangement existed under which, in virtually all respects, the State Bank had a relationship with the Reserve Bank of Australia identical to that between the Reserve Bank and private banks authorised under the Banking Act; that the arrangement was formalised on or about 23 February 1990 and continues to this date; that the relevant prudential guidelines applied to both the State Bank of Victoria and its subsidiaries, including Tricontinental? In light of events, what good purpose did the Reserve Bank-State Bank of Victoria arrangement serve, and what reliance should other States now place on the supervisory arrangements between their State banks and the Reserve Bank?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1834" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard a lot of noise from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this subject. Early this week he put out a press statement saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When Parliament resumes this week, the coalition will press its attack on the Treasurer over his failure to fully disclose what he knew about the financial difficulties leading to the collapse of the Farrow Group of building societies and also the problems of Tricontinental Group which resulted in the sell-off of the State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>He then lists a whole series of questions. So important were they that on the last day of the sittings, after questions which often have not been of a high national importance, he rolls in with this question, presumably to satisfy the fact that he has at least raised the issue, having fulminated about it earlier in the week. So at least in the eyes of the media he did not squib it entirely.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me say this to the issue at hand: there seems to be a view implied in the question that supervision by the Reserve Bank of Australia will mean that no bank will make a decision which it might subsequently regret commercially; that Reserve Bank supervision means that all banks will perform uniformly; that the Reserve Bank places itself in a position where it is making judgments about corporate business and other categories of lending on institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> This of course is not so. The Reserve Bank basically obliges banks to meet certain liquidity ratios and, of course, it discusses particularly large transactions to the extent that they might affect the book of a bank with a bank management. But, by and large, it is a supervisory role to see that the general structure of a bank's book is sound and that depositors are protected. It is not there to see that no bank picks up commercially bad business, because it is not in a position to do that.</PARA>
<PARA> The State Bank of Victoria was not formally supervised by the Reserve Bank; it was informally supervised. This essentially involved meeting the Reserve Bank's liquidity ratios and, as the Deputy Leader and shadow Treasurer says correctly, it was only in February 1990 that the then Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Jolley, said he was seeking a more formal arrangement with the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the reporting by the bank under these arrangements was, of course, entirely voluntary. If the State Bank of Victoria or any section of its operations did not wish to give a true picture of that section's activities, a true picture was not in fact obtained. In fact, the full extent of the Tricontinental losses was unknown to the State Bank of Victoria's own board until about mid-year. So it is naive to claim that a full reporting process, even if in place, would have exposed the full losses of Tricontinental earlier than when I was informed of them on 19 June.</PARA>
<PARA> Financial institutions generally obtain a true idea of their bad loan portfolio at their half-yearly accounting periods. I am advised that this is the case with Tricontinental, which is why the initial action was taken in February, and the further bad loans only became apparent later.</PARA>
<PARA> As has been made clear in numerous statements by Victorian and Federal sources, it was wide public knowledge prior to June that Tricontinental had suffered significant losses, but the full extent of these only progressively became apparent as the Victorian authorities delved deeper into the affairs of Tricontinental. So it is true to say that I was staggered by the revelations of 19 June that the losses of Tricontinental were approximately double those which had been previously and publicly understood to be the case. So the decision by the Victorian Government to have the Reserve Bank formally supervise the State Bank was made in response to earlier knowledge of the Tricontinental debts, which amounted to only about half of what became apparent by 19 June.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that it may become apparent over time that, indeed, there are more losses from Tricontinental. I say this without any knowledge, but again one has to look at the security that the bank held and the values of the assets which were encumbered by it. In a market where asset values have been falling, it is very difficult to tell what the ultimate losses will be or what recovery there may be of those losses over time. So one is not in a position to know, and Reserve Bank supervision cannot possibly be able to countenance those things, particularly when the State Bank board itself did not know the extent of the losses of its own subsidiary.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I know of the deep interest of the honourable member for Dobell in this matter and, accordingly, thank him for his question. I can assure the honourable member that the Government does have a strong commitment to science and research in this country, and that commitment is based around a strategy that is built on two fundamental principles: firstly, the need to build our strength, our excellence, in long-term, basic scientific research; and secondly, to better commercialise it, better apply it, so that for this country we get the benefits in terms of competitiveness and solutions to our environmental problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Budget commits to that strategy in two important ways: firstly, so far as funding is concerned; and, secondly, in regard to the announcement in the initial stage of the cooperative research centre program. In terms of funding, it is important for the other side of this House to understand what the Government's commitment is in fostering the excellence. The last Budget developed a program by which, in real outlays, expenditure on research and science in this country has gone up 2.3 per cent. Since the Hawke Government has come to power, real expenditure has gone up 23 per cent in this area against total outlays of 10 per cent. It is a very strong commitment to prioritising the need to improve our research and science base in this country against the background of very tight fiscal discipline.</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget is not the only means by which research and development in this country can be funded. The private sector has a responsibility to put more effort into that area. I am pleased to be able to say, again as part of the strategic framework that this Government has developed through initiatives such as the l50 per cent deductability on taxation for qualified research under programs such as the grants for industry research and development scheme and various industry development programs, that private sector expenditure on research and development has more than doubled. Over the past year there has been a l6 per cent increase. In addition, the Budget spelled out the program for cooperative research centres, a program that will focus our efforts better on getting cooperation between the different sectors of research in this country and getting better linkages with industry. It is the commercialisation and the application of our research and development effort that will be a significant contributor to overcoming our balance of payments difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to allude to Opposition members in this context. I notice that the shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Gippsland, is not present in the chamber and that is unfortunate. He has made two statements of recent times indicating where the Opposition's thinking is on science and research in this country. First, in a letter published in the Australian Financial Review in August he indicated that so far as the Opposition was concerned there would be no government support for commercialisation-the very thing that this Government is trying to encourage, the Opposition would knock off. Quite apart from what I might have to say about that, it is revealing to see what the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, FASTS, has had to say on two occasions. On the first occasion it said:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Opposition does not see a role for government in bringing this about-</PARA>
<PARA>that is commercialisation-</PARA>
<PARA>then perhaps it does not deserve a role in government,</PARA>
<PARA>Its second statement was this:</PARA>
<PARA>If the coalition thinks that the problems of commercialisation of research are purely those of macro-economic policies, then do we really need a shadow Minister for Science and Technology?</PARA>
<PARA>Well we may ask. The second revelation in terms of the Opposition's thinking in this field is a statement that was made by the Opposition spokesman at a forum that he and I attended in relation to post-Budget matters. In that, he suggested that what this country needs to develop its research and science effort is a full-scale review of the structure in which science and technology research takes place. I do not know where the shadow Minister has been over the past few years. I know that he had this shadow portfolio during the previous Government but the simple fact of the matter is that that effort has already been made. That review has been undertaken. The implication in his statement went also to the dismembering of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, a suggestion that was rejected by the Australian Science and Technology Council report, a suggestion that has been condemned by the CSIRO itself, and a suggestion that has been condemned by the National Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA> I say simply that the Government's record is a proud one in terms of fostering science and research in this country. It is the correct direction in which this country should go, but what we have to get better at is the commercialisation and the application. We have the strategy for it and those on the other side of the House do not. What I would be interested to hear from them are constructive comments rather than this nitpicking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer them as the honourable member has put them. Given the fact that he said that when the Parliament resumed he would put all of these questions to me, I have prepared replies to them. The first question stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Given the Treasurer's admission that he was informed of developments regarding Pyramid `as events unfolded', what did he know about the financial difficulties of Pyramid prior to 13 February 1990?</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member did not ask me that question just now, but I am sure that he will, so I might as well do the lot seriatim. The shadow Treasurer seeks to imply that I knew of the financial difficulties of Pyramid prior to 13 February. That is nonsense. The only advice received by my office prior to 13 February was a minute dated 12 February which referred to an article on Pyramid that had appeared in the Sunday Herald on 11 February which stated that there had been small net withdrawals from the Society. That advice in no way even remotely amounted to knowledge of Pyramid's difficulties. In the event the minute was not even drawn to my attention as it was not considered such a serious issue at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>The second question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What information about Pyramid was communicated to the Prime Minister and other Ministers prior to 13 February 1990?</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing was communicated to the Prime Minister and other Ministers because, other than what had been in the media, there was nothing to communicate. The third question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What input did Mr Keating and/or his personal staff have in the giving of a guarantee of security by the Victorian State Government to the depositors in Farrow Group companies?</PARA>
<PARA>There was no input by myself or my personal staff to the Victorian Minister's statement of 13 February 1990. As I described earlier, at that time Victorian officials contacted the Reserve Bank about the status of lines of credit to the Pyramid Building Society by major trading banks. The Reserve Bank told the Victorian officials that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Reserve Bank has a longstanding understanding with banks that they will consider sympathetically a request for finance received from building societies which are responsibly managed and have adequate asset backing.</PARA>
<PARA>These words were included in the statement of 13 February. This is a completely appropriate involvement for the Federal authorities. These contacts were at an official level and I first became aware of the terms of the statement when the statement was released to the media. I repeat: There was no involvement by myself or my office in the preparation of the statement or the decision to make that statement, nor was there any contact between my office and the Reserve Bank regarding the Reserve Bank's contribution to that statement.</PARA>
<PARA>The fourth question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What knowledge of the $300 million bail out of the State Bank of Victoria by the South Australia Labor Government (through the South Australian Financing Authority) in December 1989, did Mr Keating have?</PARA>
<PARA>I had no knowledge of any advance made by the South Australian Financing Authority to the State Bank of Victoria. Therefore, obviously enough, I had no input in negotiating that agreement. The fifth question stated:</PARA>
<PARA>What input did the Treasurer have in negotiating that deal in view of the fact that the Reserve Bank was fully aware and had given their approval for it to proceed?</PARA>
<PARA>In regard to the role of the Reserve Bank, the bank had informed me in recent days that it had approved the terms of the capital issue by the State Bank of Victoria in December 1989. It did not approve, nor was it aware of, the source of any subscriptions to that issue. The Reserve Bank would not normally seek that sort of detailed information. As I have stated, this information was provided to me by the Reserve Bank in recent days. It was under no obligation to inform me at the time, nor did it do so.</PARA>
<PARA> That answers the questions which have been put to me by the Opposition, including the one just asked about Pyramid. These are put on the basis that somehow everyone has done something wrong here-the Commonwealth Government, the State Government-but the Opposition never mentions the Farrow Group. It was the Farrow Group, which was close to the Liberal Party of Victoria, that was running a property company masquerading as a building society on which, we understand, huge fees were taken by the Farrow Group directors for modest services provided to the building society. It was then taking deposits off the market and people were lending to it at rates of interest which they believed reflected the safety of the institution.</PARA>
<PARA> If Opposition members want to attack anybody they should attack the Farrow Group of companies, which has been associated with and close to the Liberal Party, for misleading the public of Victoria, and Geelong in particular. It sought to have people believe that they were investing in a body which lent its funds on to housing where it had mortgaged backed security in the housing market with decent and sensible prudential ratios for the loans. In fact, they were lending to a highly geared property company from which the directors were taking fees.</PARA>
<PARA> Why do honourable members opposite not get up, if they want to bash their gums, and have a go at the Farrow Group instead of attacking the central bank?</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of the serious effects on the small, but internationally recognised, Australian manufacturers of high quality outdoor apparel caused by the escalating duty rate on the fabric known as Goretex? Why is the duty on Goretex fabric increasing when assistance to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries is being reduced by the TCF plan?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1838" SPEAKER="Beddall The Hon D.P." NAMEID="QE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="RANKIN" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS AND CUSTOMS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out that during the parliamentary inquiry into small business, two companies in the honourable member's electorate, Mont Equipment Pty Ltd and J. &amp;H. Agencies Pty Ltd, did raise this matter with the parliamentary committee. I am also aware that the increasing duty on Goretex fabrics is placing additional pressure on a small but growing local industry that uses Goretex in the manufacture of high quality outdoor apparel. The increasing duty rate arises from the Government's decision on the assistance for textiles, clothing and footwear industries that arose from the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry in 1986. In 1986 there were over 5,000 possible tariff classifications, 50 policy by-laws, bounty schedules and tariff quotas. It was decided by the government of the day to rationalise these barrier arrangements. In this context the number of by-laws were rationalised with the intention of phasing them out by gradually increasing the duty rate to the level accorded other fabrics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Overall these decisions by the Government substantially reduce the level of assistance available to the TCF industries and provide the framework for the establishment of a more externally oriented and competitive industry. In the case of Goretex, there were always tariffs on Goretex fabrics. However, these have been removed in the past by a policy by-law as part of the Government's TCF industries assistance plan. Goretex was picked up in this rationalisation and the policy by-law now has phasing rates which increase to the full duty rate of 40 per cent in 1993. The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority is currently looking to establish a means by which links between the conflicting requests of the outdoor apparel manufacturers and the local fabric suppliers can be reconciled and will shortly report to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member had got the quote right, he would know that I said that Australia is savings poor and it is savings poor because we have been relying on overseas savings for most of the 1980s. We have been relying on overseas savings from 1981, substantially, because of the structural weakness of the economy induced by the Liberal Party when in office. We could not produce enough goods and services, so we had to rely on someone else's goods and services, then pay for them by relying upon their savings. So that is the position with our savings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is this Government which has augmented national savings by reducing the call by the public sector on Australian savings to the tune of seven per cent of gross domestic product or, this year, about $30 billion. We can just imagine what kinds of interest rates would attend a bond selling program which this year added $30 billion of demands to financial markets; the effect would, of course, be quite profound.</PARA>
<PARA> What my colleague is saying is that there may be, in certain parts of the Australian infrastructure, places where there is need of more public support. That may well be correct, but it will be attended to with the kind of priority setting which this Government has become synonymous with. We have put in place a set of spending priorities which have been essentially paid for by taking away the spending priorities of former governments, or even our own former priorities. That is how we have attended to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> Assets sales can produce a substantial structural improvement to a Budget because of the long term savings which come from public debt interest. But unlike, say, the Thatcher Government of Britain, we have not changed the Budget balance from a deficit to a surplus by relying on asset sales. We have done it by changes to recurrent government spending. But the structural benefit available to any Budget is from the long term benefit, which is in reduced public debt interest. That can assist in the development of other ongoing expenditure programs. To that extent the Government has used asset sales as a longer term relieving measure to the public debt interest side of the Budget. So there is no particular conflict in policy there, real or imagined.</PARA>
<PARA> The House should just bear in mind that the essential problem is that the country cannot produce enough goods and services and the reason for that is that we stopped investing in ourselves from the late 1960s until the middle 1980s. Basically, the main reason for that was indifferent fiscal policy, a hopeless wages policy, and a smashed profit share, all of which produced a great hole in our investment-and the honourable member's Party was responsible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am sure the Opposition will join me when I say that the Government and I welcome the historic treaty, which settles the remaining aspects of German reunification, settled yesterday and signed yesterday by the foreign Ministers of both Germanies and the four wartime allies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The treaty ends the four occupying countries' special powers over Germany, including the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany by 1994. Importantly, it ensures that existing external borders will be maintained. It is indeed truly the final settlement to World War II. I believe that congratulations are due to the governments and the leaders of both Germanies and to the four wartime allies who, in fact, in seven months achieved what previously could not be done in 45 years.</PARA>
<PARA> For generations Europe has been locked behind barricades and it has been oppressed by the threat of hostilities. I believe that it has taken enormous vision, application and dedication by Chancellor Kohl, Prime Minister De Maiziere, Presidents Bush and Gorbachev, President Mitterrand, and Prime Minister Thatcher to bring about a dignified end to the cold war.</PARA>
<PARA> The signing of this Treaty removes the last obstacles to unification and allows a united sovereign Germany to take its place among the community of nations by 3 October. I and the other members of the Government welcome unequivocally German unification and it is our wish to see a unified Germany fully and harmoniously integrated with the rest of Europe. We welcome the agreement for a united Germany to be a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the context of the new relationships that exist between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact partners.</PARA>
<PARA> During the last year we have seen the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismantling of Checkpoint Charlie and we see an unprecedented momentum towards the development of a new Europe. That is important not only for the countries and the people of Europe but also for the world. It is essential that these opportunities now be pursued with energy and vision, and I can assure the House that Australia will continue, as it has already been doing, to play an active role in the international community to support an open and free Europe.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a curious line of questioning from the Leader of the Opposition. He has asked about three or four questions this week; he is almost the invisible man in the Parliament, but curious press statements come from his office and claims and charges come from the Leader of the Opposition himself. In one press release he mentioned `theatrically contrived crises'. He went on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . each of which has had to be dealt with by Paul John Keating pulling on his yellow raincoat and zooming in to the rescue in his Betsy. . .Boy! What a script. Dick Tracy could not ask for more.</PARA>
<PARA>In my office we call this the Dick Tracy press release.</PARA>
<PARA> There are more. They go on and on. Some mention the State Bank. I remind people that in talking about Tricontinental, the Leader of the Opposition said that it was clear that this was a Victorian problem which should have a Victorian solution. That is, he said that an insolvent institution with about $25 billion worth of assets, with about 30 per cent of the deposit base in Victoria, should have a Victorian solution to its problems. He did not think that the Federal Government or the central bank should be involved in seeking to avert an enormous and major financial crisis in the State of Victoria affecting most of its citizens. For shabby political purposes, he alleges that it is a Victorian problem; therefore,the public of Victoria should wear the possible collapse of its largest financial institution and somehow the Commonwealth should stand back. I hope that Victorians understand what the Leader of the Opposition thinks about their welfare.</PARA>
<PARA> This line of questioning goes to the matter of Tricontinental and the Aust- ralian Bank Ltd licence. I would have been consulted about that; I remember the issue coming past me. I also remember the fact that I communicated with, I think, the State Bank of Victoria about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I hope he will appreciate the brief answer with which I will provide him. Indeed, this has been International Literacy Year and Australia has been making a very significant contribution to the international year, not only here in Australia but also within our region. The national consultative committee that we established decided that there would be four major areas of its work, adult literacy being one, child and community literacy being another, overseas literacy another and public awareness another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the course of this year the national consultative committee has been very successful in bringing Australia's attention to the perhaps disguised problem of functional illiteracy amongst a relatively large number of Australian people and particularly drawing attention to the consequences of that in the work force and the economy generally.</PARA>
<PARA> During the remaining months of the committee's work it will be finalising its recommendations to us about what specific action should be taken by the Government to address some of these important issues. I want to say particularly that because we realise that the committee has done a good job and needs to continue its work, this Budget decided to extend its activities during the first half of next year and provided it with three quarters of a million dollars with which to continue its work.</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of this Budget we provided an additional $4.5m for each of the next three years to increase the programs available through technical and further education colleges and community organisations to address the problem of adult literacy. We have also provided $7m for assessment and provision of literacy services under the early intervention component of the active employment strategy as well as $3.3m to deal with literacy issues in skill share programs.</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that this is a problem confronting Australians of all ages. It is something which needs to be dealt with not only within the education system as we are doing but also amongst the adult population and through the work force. In relation to that we have sought and achieved the support and cooperation of the trade union movement and employers. I think that those in the work force who recognise that they do have difficulties as far as their English literacy skills are concerned can look forward to a greater number of services and a greater diversity of services to assist them to overcome these serious problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition brings this matter of public importance to the Parliament today appropriately enough because the Australian Industrial Relations Commission reconvened in Melbourne this morning on the application of the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures to hear the current national wage case. It gives to the Opposition and the Parliament an opportunity to say something about the relevance of the current wage fixing mechanism to Australia's economic problems. It also provides the Opposition with the chance of dealing once again with the big lie of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement about the history of wage fixation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of these days a political commentator in Australia will write a series of articles under the general title of `The Myths of Paul Keating'. We got one of those myths today in Question Time, and I take the opportunity at the commencement of this speech to deal with it. That myth is that the current account deficit, which is the biggest single economic problem besetting Australia at the present time, is a product of economic mistakes in the 1970s. I say in reply to that, as I will say with equal relevance in reply to the big lies about wages policy, that it is a very instructive claim by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I have in my possession a document called The Australian Macro Economy in the 1980s. It is the transcript of the proceedings of a conference of Australia's best economists convened every few years by the Reserve Bank of Australia, an institution that we were told in Question Time was a great and decent financial institution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Above criticism, looking after the interests of the Australian people. There is a very interesting footnote in the introduction. The introduction says how during the 1980s the current account deficit became the great preoccupation of government and of policy makers in Australia. The footnote says that by contrast the current account was not included in the top 10 facts from the summary of the 1979 conference. In other words, the conference held 10 years earlier deemed the current account deficit as an economic problem not to be worthy of listing in the top 10 facts that were relevant to the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>

That, of course, brings us to present day circumstances.

<PARA> What is happening at the moment is very simple. The ACTU has temporarily put the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to one side. Martin Ferguson has said the Commission is irrelevant for the time being. In other words, its relevance will return in the future. The ACTU is going into the field and attempting to get from employer groups wage settlements on an industry by industry basis-and that point is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU will then go back to the Commission and say, `We have got this wage settlement in the field. Will you please put a rubber stamp on it'. As a result, under the principle of comparative wage justice, which is at the heart of the centralised wage fixing system, those agreements will flow through the entire economy. They will be imposed upon every employer in the country, whether the employer can afford it or not, and the ACTU will have the result that it wants. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing about that process is that it bears great similarity to what happened in 1981. In 1981 the metal unions went to the Metal Trades Industry Association and extracted an agreement which was rubber stamped by the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being in the public interest, and it then flowed through the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the economic conditions now are different from what they were in 1981. In 1981 the economy was not in as deep a recession as it is now. In fact, in 1981 the level of economic activity was still very buoyant, although by 1982 and 1983 that situation had changed. I readily acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, as we examine what is happening with wage fixation in Australia, that we understand the great similarities, both structural and procedural, that exist between what the ACTU is now doing and what it did in 1981. At the moment the ACTU is trying to peddle the line-and Bill Kelty is the worst culprit-that in some way what the ACTU is now doing is an exercise in enterprise bargaining. It is not an exercise in enterprise bargaining. I am sorry to say that this misunderstanding is widely repeated by most industrial relations writers around Australia, who seem to accept as holy writ the definition of industrial terms put forward by the ACTU and by the other members of the industrial relations club. </PARA>
<PARA> . </PARA>
<PARA> An enterprise bargain is not a bargain struck collectively across an industry; it is a bargain struck between the owners of an individual enterprise and that enterprises's employees-either collectively or individually or by the appointed agent or representative of those employees. That kind of bargain is a world away from what happened in 1981, and it is a world away from what the ACTU is now proposing. I say here that I pay tribute to the resolution that has been displayed by the Metal Trades Industry Association on this occasion, although I acknowledge that the MTIA is no fan of my industrial relations policy and probably never will be. At least it is being consistent on this occasion. It rejected accord mark 6 at the beginning of the year and it has gone on rejecting it. </PARA>
<PARA> The major employer groups should now be going to the ACTU and saying, `Well, if you really want enterprise bargaining, why don't we try to reach some agreements under section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act?' That provides for certified agreements, which is as far as they can go under the present Government's policy to have an enterprise bargain. I will wager now that if the employer groups did that the ACTU would run a mile. It would say, `No, we're not interested in that'. The ACTU is not interested in enterprise bargaining of a true nature because once we have enterprise bargaining of a true nature the role of the ACTU and of the organised union movement is significantly reduced. That, of course, is what this campaign by the ACTU is all about. It is all about the role of the ACTU in the industrial landscape in Australia in 1990 and for the rest of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Right at the moment, I believe that the potential to achieve major change in Australia's industrial relations system is greater than we have had at any time since the end of World War II. Anybody who examines it ought to be very careful about making comparisons between now and the early 1980s or the mid-1970s because the world has changed completely. To start with, there has been a change in the legal balance between employers and employees because of the effect of cases such as Dollar Sweets and Mudginberri; the operation of section 45d; the fact that less than a year ago a former President of the ACTU, the present Prime Minister of Australia, exhorted the airlines of this nation to sue a trade union. He exhorted them, he told them, he begged them. He said, `Go ahead and sue it'. That would have been unheard of and unthought of five years ago when Hancock reported and said it was impossible to make ordinary unions accountable to the ordinary courts, that we could not really expect a union to take any notice of a decision of an ordinary court. Yet five years later President Hawke himself said, `Go out and issue writs against the union'. That shows the extent to which industrial relations in Australia has changed over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more importantly than that, what has really changed is that the organised trade union movement, as with other organisations, including organised political parties, has a lesser grip on the hearts and minds of individual Australians than it used to have. The biggest problem that Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson will have in the 1990s is holding on to their members. The ACTU in the 1990s will face a continuing crisis of legitimacy. It now represents only 32 per cent of the private sector work force in Australia, and increasingly it is having difficulty controlling some of the more intelligent unions as well as some of the more militant. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning I read in the Australian newspaper a comment I shall quote because it is very relevant to what I am talking about-the declining legitimacy of the ACTU:</PARA>
<PARA> What we promise is increased efficiency and that our people will work smarter. In response we need a commitment that a reasonable amount of money made in profits will be invested back into the company or industry to ensure good working conditions and up-graded technology, so as to ensure longevity of the business. </PARA>
<PARA> We also demand job security, that jobs won't be thrown away for any but the strictest economic reasons. And we are prepared to negotiate wages. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a statement by Steve Harrison, the National Secretary of the Federated Ironworkers Association. Whilst I would not agree with everything in it, it is a mile away from the ramblings of Martin Ferguson. It is a mile away from the ramblings of some union leaders, who are so out of touch with reality that they do not understand that the ordinary workers of this country resent the fact that their real wages have declined by 15 per cent over the last six years and that this campaign of the ACTU owes a great deal to the fact that the ordinary rank and file of the trade union movement are very unhappy with what has happened to their real remuneration over the last six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason wages have declined-and I acknowledge that the decline in real wages has made a contribution to employment growth; I know that there is a link between the two-is that we have had an appalling productivity performance over the years of the accord, and what the Government effectively has done with its economic management is to substitute a wages blow-out with a foreign debt blow-out. In fact, if the Government had followed a different economic policy, it would not now be faced with the enormous foreign debt crisis which is the ongoing preoccupation of all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> What this country needs now more than ever before is a change in its industrial relations culture to a new culture that does not exclude trade unions, that does not go back to the days of `them and us', but is dedicated to one overriding principle. That principle is that the most important thing in the industrial world of the 1990s is not the success of the trade union movement, the industrial relations establishment or the employer organisations but the success and profitability of each and every individual enterprise around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way we will ever build national productivity in a way that will enable us to overcome our enormous debt problem is to build the aggregate productivity of every individual enterprise in this country. That will come only through an industrial relations system which puts the enterprise first, and there is only one side of politics in Australia that has the commitment to that, has the political freedom to achieve it and has the dedication to do it when elected to government-and that is the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I address the attempts of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) to rewrite history, both in respect of the current account and wages. When the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer he maintained that there was no current account problem. If he looks back at the economic records of this country, he will find that in 1981-82 the current account deficit was 6 per cent of gross domestic product. The current account and balance of payments problem did not begin with this Government. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said many times in this place, it was something which we inherited from the previous Government, for the reason that he has given-that is, the mismanagement of the previous Government, which for decades did not build competitive industries to compete with imports and win export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we came to office that current account deficit had been reduced somewhat from the previous year, but that was because we were in the worst recession for 50 years. Structurally, we had this enormously damaging factor in the Australian economy of the current account deficit, which was there as a result of the policies pursued for decades previously, including the years when the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer of this country. That was the first attempt of the honourable member for Bennelong to rewrite history. </PARA>
<PARA> His second attempt to rewrite history related more directly to the topic of this matter of public importance, which is wages. The honourable member for Bennelong says that in 1981 similar things happened to what he sees happening now-that is, attempts by the union movement to go out and get employers to agree to give a certain level of wage increase, take that agreement to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and then have it flow through the Commission. I do not deny that that was largely what happened. However, there is an enormous dissimilarity between that and what is happening now. The enormous dissimilarity is that we are now operating on the basis of an accord, to which the trade union movement is still absolutely committed-and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has certainly not in any way suggested that it is walking away from that accord-which says that for this financial year there will be a wages outcome of 7 per cent. The wages outcome at its peak in 1981-82 was 17 per cent-an enormous wages blow-out which effectively blew the Fraser Government out of office. </PARA>
<PARA> Because there was no accord, because there was no understanding between government and unions about wages policy and because it was left to the market to sort out, that is what happened. The great difference that has occurred in this Government's period in office has been that, from the very first day, a wages policy has been in place that has ensured we have rational wages outcomes, outcomes which until recent times have produced the fastest rates of growth of any country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and certainly have produced a much faster rate of growth in employment than in any other country. Real unit wage costs have fallen by about 10 per cent in our period in office. That is an enormous turnaround compared with what happened during the term of the coalition Government, when real unit wage costs increased by several per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> We are looking at a totally different set of circumstances in regard to wages. Whatever one makes of what is happening at the present time, no one can claim credibly that it is a similar situation to 1981. The honourable member for Bennelong claimed that that was the situation, but he can in no way do so credibly. We are now taking a further step along the path of a relaxation of what has been largely a centralised wage fixing system-highly centralised in the first years of this Government's period in office and becoming a little less centralised as we have gone along, especially taking that step towards some greater decentralisation with the award restructuring approach, which essentially has put a lot of activity back into the enterprise, and I stress that. As part of the accord mark 6 a further step is being taken along that path, putting more of the emphasis back at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I come to speak about what is happening now, I shall remind the House in further detail of what has happened in terms of developing wages policy at the enterprise level. In the wages policy before the current one, that is, the one relating to the first and second tiers, there was a clear attempt with the second tier to try to get a lot of activity at the enterprise level, to achieve the wages outcome. That resulted in a lot of enterprise level activity to cover the wage costs, to get Commission endorsement, and resulted in the establishment in many cases of consultative committees at the enterprise level. That indeed was a welcome development and certainly a substantial step towards having more activity at the enterprise level rather than the central level, but at the same time within an overall framework established by the Commission, flowing from the accord and with principles established and set out in detail by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> With the award restructuring we moved to a system where there is much greater flexibility available at the workplace, where through award restructuring there is multiskilling of the work force and wide classifications, instead of the very narrow type of classifications, so that management can use its work force much more flexibly. That was a development that was greatly welcomed and was a great challenge to management to use that tool of increased flexibility at the enterprise level, which it had not had before, certainly not this century. In addition to that development of a more flexible use of the work force in that broad sense, in many awards there have been changes made both to those awards and at the enterprise level that have enabled the introduction of greater flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall not take up too much time of the House to go into detail. Let me say simply that in regard to award level variations there has been an expansion of the span of ordinary hours, a common variation in a number of industries, inclusion of a provision for 12-hour shifts; several awards have been varied to allow for time off in lieu of overtime; there have been changes introduced to allow overtime to be used more flexibly; penalty rates have been changed to become less restrictive. In addition, there has been the introduction of part time work and the removal of restrictions on the use of casual employees. All of those have been changes at the award level. There have been also enterprise flexibility variations of different kinds. </PARA>
<PARA> The metal industry award-the largest award of all and therefore, I guess, the most important-has been varied significantly to provide more scope for key working arrangements such as 12-hour shifts, meal rest periods, timing of annual leave and scheduling of close-downs to be determined at the workplace level. When it is agreed to at the workplace level, this then overrides the provision of the award. This is enterprise level flexibility of a very substantial kind-and that is in the largest award of all. But it is in many other awards as well as part of the award restructuring process. So in the last few years there has been-and I think it has been totally unrecognised, certainly in public statements by the relevant Opposition spokesman or anybody else that I have noticed-a very substantial increase in the degree of flexibility at the work place level brought about by the wages policy that has been developed over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that that is welcomed by all. We certainly want to see a more flexible system and we want to see an enterprise being able to develop the use of its work force in a way which suits both the employees and management in the particular circumstances that they face. Those changes have not been greatly related to the actual level of wage increases at this stage, but in accord mark 6 we are now moving to a stage where the actual level of wage increase can be determined at the enterprise level to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> Accord mark 6 has these features. It involves two general increases, the first of which flowed on to the consumer price index increase for the September quarter this year and the second of which, another $12 increase, will occur six months later. In addition to that, 3 per cent additional superannuation will be flowed-in over a two-year period beginning not before May next year. Furthermore, increases will be able to be achieved at the enterprise level and there will be a relaxation of what has been the central feature so far-the no extra claims principle-so that there can be enterprise level wage increases based on achieved productivity or profitability. That is the key element of change in accord mark 6. It is a very significant change and one which the Government supports within the context of a responsible wages outcome. As I said, this year that figure has been set at 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In the submission that the Commonwealth is making at the preliminary hearing of the national wage case-which hearing begins today, as the honourable member for Bennelong mentioned-we will be making it clear that we support accord mark 6 and we support enterprise negotiations for wage increases. Of course, as part of accord mark 6 it was also acknowledged that there would need to be framework negotiations with employer organisations and unions at the outset. We have had that and that has been happening in recent times. Negotiations have taken place between unions and employer organisations, as was agreed would happen in the context of accord mark 6, to try to get some greater agreement about the principles which will apply to wage fixation at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> Accord mark 6 also states that those principles will be eventually established by the Commission, rather than by agreement of the parties. We want to get agreement initially by the parties-that is not unusual; negotiation by the parties prior to a national wage case hearing has occurred several times since we have been in office as well as in previous times-and these negotiations are designed to get some greater agreement on the principles before the case starts. </PARA>
<PARA> Once the case begins and the Commission comes out with its principles, everybody will be able to proceed on the basis of enterprise negotiations on clear principles established by the Commission. That is, indeed, a very rational and sensible way to go. If I may make a prediction for the future, I expect that we will see more and more of the wages outcome determined in that way and less and less of it determined by across the board general increases such as the two that I have mentioned as being in accord mark 6. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in an evolving situation, and we are evolving in a very responsible way towards a much more flexible system, with much more of the wages outcome being determined at the enterprise level. Compare that with the Opposition which, as in most cases, has an extremist view-a view which totally sidelines it from the realistic debate. In relation to general economic, telecommunications and wages policies, the Opposition is right out there in the right wing field-so far out that it is just totally irrelevant to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The employer organisations do not want to have anything to do with the Opposition and neither does the union movement. Most of the commentators think the Opposition is way out there in cloud-cuckoo-land. Obviously the Opposition has no concept of what is needed to control wages. The Opposition's period in government proved that. The man who is laughing and giggling away at the table-the honourable member for Bennelong, the Treasurer of this country under a previous government; the man who presided over a 17 per cent wage increase in 1981-82-now sits back thinking he has all the answers. His attitude is, `Just let it all happen out there again, just like it did before. Let them all have enterprise level agreements. It will all be terrific and we know we will get a responsible outcome from that'. How does the Opposition know? The Opposition has no idea of what the outcome would be-absolutely no idea. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way that the Opposition would control that outcome would be to keep the economy chloroformed to a degree which would mean that there would never be any growth in this country. There would never be the kind of growth that we have seen in this country in the past seven years. The Opposition would have nothing like that. The only way that the Opposition knows how to control wages-as it showed when it was last in government-is to chloroform the economy periodically; then take it off; then let it all blow out again; finish up with double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That was the Opposition's record, its terribly sorry record-the record with which the Opposition is permanently doomed and which means that the people of Australia will think very hard and long before they ever allow the Opposition back on the government benches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Interest rates have gone down in other countries. Inflation in other countries has dropped to half of what it is in Australia. Wage fixing methods have been tidied up and fixed up in other countries such as Germany, the United States of America and Japan, whereas Australia is continuing to labour under its antiquated system. The good years of commodity prices and buoyant world trade have been wasted. Instead, Australia has been drifting in a sea of indecision so that today we have arrived at a situation where Australia is virtually paralysed simply because every time the Government makes a decision, it virtually guarantees 60 per cent or more of the delegates who decide these things have to be trade unionists. This is what Australia is labouring under.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia has centralisation of power and privilege in Canberra and with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), when the rest of the world, including Eastern Europe, is washing socialism, thankfully, out of the system. Australia today is an anachronism. Admittedly the Government has had some public relations success-our football loving Treasurer (Mr Keating) is still terrorising Caucus and the press, telling them that he is having great success, when he is getting failure after failure after failure. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) dropping so rapidly in the opinion polls and getting so desperate that he is now claiming as his friend-who would it be?-Margaret Thatcher. Twice in recent weeks, the Prime Minister has claimed, `Margaret Thatcher is my good friend'. If the Prime Minister would only look over his shoulder, he would see that all the backbenchers have their arms around Fidel Castro and Joseph Stalin. That is how bad things are. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has had seven and a half years of this Government and what has it delivered? It has delivered lower living standards to the tune of $50 or $60 a week and unemployment. One of the Government's supposed successes is now skyrocketing. Since Christmas an extra 90,000 people have joined the dole queue. Earlier today during Question Time, the Treasurer blamed everybody-I thought he was even going to name Brutus the Dinosaur-for the failed policies of the Government. The Government has inflation stuck between 7 and 8 per cent; interest rates still up at 15 to 20 per cent or more; and even wage fixing-the jewel in the crown-is turning out not to be a sparkling diamond but cheap glass indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a band-aid Government. No decision this Government takes is taken for the right reason. Look at uranium: what would the Prime Minister's favourite word be? Would it be `hypocrisy'? The uranium policy is only in place to pacify the Left, or what is left of it. The Treasurer has just put in place a fuel freeze. Why was that put there? It was put there so that the consumer price index figures could be put in place for the next wage fixing round. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the wage fixing policy. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the best interests of Australia; nothing whatsoever to do with the best interests of the workers; and certainly nothing whatsoever to do with the best interests for the employers who pay the bills. However, it is all to do with the best interests of this Government and ACTU power. </PARA>
<PARA> Each wage decision that has been brought down in this country under this Government has been a centralised wage decision where the employers have not been consulted. There has been no regard whatsoever towards that magic word `productivity'. Now that the system is starting to crack and break up, the Government is bereft of ideas. So what can the Government do? It cannot have another summit; it has had so many summits, it is getting embarrassing. The Government cannot have an inquiry-the Premier of Queensland has a monopoly on that. </PARA>

<PARA> The two words that are lacking in the Government's wage fixing policy are `logic' and `freedom'. Those are the words missing from the Government's vocabulary. The Government is not doing things because they are right for Australia. Look at the wage fixing rigidity Australia has today at the very time the country is crying out for flexibility and decentralisation of agreements at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Government that it should recognise that the workers of this country are human beings; they are individuals; they have their own rights and they have different priorities. Instead of wanting to round them all up into a herd, like they used to do in Russia until recently-they still do to some extent-and if anyone stepped out of line, `bang, that is it; you do not get a job; you are persecuted' why can we not have a bit of freedom in this country today? This is what we want in the world. When the Opposition gets into power, one of the first things we are going to do is abolish compulsory trade unionism. That will go. </PARA>
<PARA> For some reason, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is frightened of freedom. It does not matter that opinion polls say that 87 per cent do not want compulsory unionism, including an overwhelming majority of trade unionists themselves. They still want to force people into their mould. It might suit the ALP. It might suit the ACTU, but I tell the House this: it does not suit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do the ALP and the ACTU not do something for Australia's benefit for a change? Let us consider strikes. We are going to bring in secret ballots, but they will not have a bar of it. What do secret ballots do? They just find out what the workers genuinely want themselves. Is that such a dreadful thing? We are going to decentralise the decision-making processes with wages and grievances. We are going to abolish the days of closed shops and preferences to union members. Instead of rule by terror, we are going to give the workers what they want, in other words. </PARA>
<PARA> Civil courts will come more into play. Common law will be used for damages claims. We are going to encourage profit sharing and share ownership so that the workers themselves can have a slice of the action instead of what we have had in the past-the worker versus the boss mentality-which has been encouraged and rammed down our throats night after night on our television screens. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual agreements will be allowed to come into place. The employer will be allowed-surprise, surprise-to negotiate with the employee if he so wishes. What is so wrong with that? We will encourage these people to be paid on an hourly basis and that will put back into the system a bit of incentive for productivity. If people want to work a 30-hour week, so be it. They will get 30 times the hourly wage. If they want to work a 40-hour week, they will get 40 times the hourly wage. If they want to work a 50-hour week, they will get 50 times the hourly wage. They can work at night, during the day, on weekends, or whenever they want. It puts a bit of freedom back into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing we will do is eliminate secondary boycotts and get rid of the intimidation and thuggery that we see too much of in this country today. The Government has failed totally in the wage fixing area. It is tired, too outdated, and oppressively dominated by trade unions. It is time to free up the system and recognise for the first time in this country the rights of workers. It is time to give enterprise bargaining in Australia its rightful place. </PARA>

While he is howling in the wind about section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act and saying that employers should utilise it for enterprise agreements, they have just told him, quite frankly, to get lost. They have indicated that all of this extremist, non-mainstream thought of industrial relations is not for them. They have to deal with these people in the long term. They cannot just come here, dish up a few slogans and walk away from them. They will actually have to operate in the industrial relations sphere.

When he made some kind of way-out analogy between 1981 and 1982 he very well knew that the aggregate total of 7 per cent for this period is a totally different picture from what occurred in 1981-82 when the system, it could be said, did not show enough flexibility. Those things were out of control and the Government had no input into where the wage pattern was going. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) indicated, that certainly was a very big contribution to the downfall of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other very selective reference made by the honourable member for Bennelong was to a comment by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) with respect to a report put out by a meeting of economists convened by the Reserve Bank of Australia. He did not say that the current account deficit was not a problem. He did not actually go to the figures and establish that it was not a problem. He said that when they were looking at the economy, at that time it did not feature as one of the top 10 issues. That does not mean that they were wrong. That does not mean that things have not changed, that analogies 10 years later might say that something happened incorrectly at another time. That quote has nothing to do with whether the current account deficit was a problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member can understand it. As I say, it was a very selective quote. In recent times he has shed a lot of crocodile tears for the poor workers out there and what they are suffering. On 12 September he said that he understood the unhappiness of ordinary employees with the current wages outlook. On 3 September he said that ordinary wage and salary earners in Australia were realising that they had been taken to the cleaners by the accord. All these crocodile tears, all these concerns, about what has happened to wage earners! Of course, supposedly it will be solved by a very small minority of them struggling and actually accomplishing some kind of wage increase based on productivity in a small minority of enterprises. That is the reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst there has obviously been a reduction in wages share, as opposed to profits, in this country, whilst, as the honourable member says, workers have suffered, whilst the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has been prepared to take a responsible attitude over the last few years in regard to our trade problems, people are suffering. That is the major point, but his resolution of this is to introduce a series of voluntary agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales we saw a legislative pattern of the kinds of things intended. The real scheme behind this supposed new freedom, this new right to do this and that, is to reduce the adult minimum wage to $294.10 and to eliminate the automatic right to arbitration. The policy is to ensure that fairly under-staffed, under-resourced groups of workers without information negotiate on a supposedly equal footing with their employer. What a lot of twaddle!</PARA>
<PARA> The actual reality of all this talk about freedom and how people are going to gain so much through productivity, et cetera is, as the honourable member says in a recent press release, a situation that reflects the reality of industrial relations at the moment, the fact that the unions are on the back foot. That is the reality of trying to introduce these kinds of measures to smash the union movement, to smash workers' rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem from what the honourable member has been saying that the Government has sat on its hands for the last few years, that nothing has happened in regard to voluntary agreements, that the Government wants to tie totally the centralised wage fixing system with no variations. He knows very well that is not factually correct. He knows that in actual fact there is a transitional period at the moment in regard to industrial relations in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct-a transient period of industrial relations. We have seen the efforts by the Government in workplace reform programs, the actual assistance for research and pilot programs, employment of advisers, et cetera in respect of the work change assistance scheme, the workplace resources scheme, work change training schemes-actual initiatives by the Government about what is going to happen at the enterprise level, what is going to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member well knows, despite the fact that he did not mention it, there has been a particular loosening up of a number of agreements, a number of awards, in areas such as overtime, penalty rates and weekend rates. It is occurring. What he is saying, in contrast, is that there cannot be a structured, negotiated process between employers. He wants to come in smack down the middle and destroy the whole system in one go because of some ideological predilection. He well knows that in mark 6 of the accord there is a place for productivity bargaining as long as it keeps within the 7 per cent total package. As I said earlier, that is a totally different situation from what happened in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member deplores the poor lot of the workers, it is probably worth getting back to what has actually occurred during this period. Unemployment has been massively reduced. It is all right for him to come down with the latest month's statistics. They look pretty good compared to their performance in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to press releases of recent days in which the honourable member for Bennelong made some reference to what happened in the June quarter. As I indicated, the actual deterioration of the employment pattern in this country is still massively better liked than the performance of the honourable member. More than 1 1/2 million jobs have been created, yet the honourable member talks as though the whole country were collapsing. That is the reality of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very great downturn in industrial disputes over the period of the Hawke Government does not count for anything either, apparently. We have recent statistics for those disputes. The figure for working days lost in the month of May is the highest monthly figure since July 1989, admittedly, but the average number of working days lost per month has fallen by 54 per cent-a fairly significant reduction since the Fraser Government period. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all bemoaning how serious the situation is, yet the trend in this country is for a 10.5 per cent decrease in labour unit costs. The trade union movement has worked with the Government, recognised the problems and is moving in stages toward a greater decentralisation of the wage structure and in the way decisions are made. The trade union movement has cooperated in regard to restructuring and has shown increased flexibility on a variety of fronts relating to industrial conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The union movement is facing difficulties because of the loss of membership and other pressures on it. This situation represents a very good opportunity to ensure that wage conditions are reduced even further and this is the reality behind all the concerns, these throwaway lines, about the fact that the workers are discontented and that people can half understand their worries. This matter of public importance ignores the reality that much is happening in the union movement. It ignores the accord that is leading toward decentralised procedures for wages, and that is the reason why it should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tabling of these finance minutes today reflects the ongoing concern of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts about the accountability of the Executive to the Parliament. Arrangements to ensure that appropriate action is taken in response to comments contained in the Committee's reports have been in operation since 1952. The arrangements have been that after a report by the Committee is tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate the Chairman of the Committee forwards a copy of the report to the responsible Minister. A copy is also forwarded to the Minister for Finance, together with a request that the report be considered and the Chairman subsequently be informed of actions to address the Committee's recommendations. The reply, in the form of a Department of Finance minute, is then examined by the Committee and submitted, with comment if necessary, as a report to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its report 291, `Revised Procedures for Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts', which was tabled in this place in June 1988, the Committee advised that it would consolidate the tabling of all finance minutes into one annual report, the only exceptions being finance minutes that were urgent or lengthy or which for some other reason required immediate reporting to the Parliament. The Committee tabled a consolidated volume of finance minutes for the first time in November last year under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), now Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> This consolidated volume of finance minutes was the Committee's 301st report and, not surprisingly, was entitled `Finance Minutes'. In this report the Committee noted that it intended to continue the practice of tabling all finance minutes received in a particular year within one annual volume but that it also intended to make each finance minute available to Parliament as soon as practicable after it is received by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Importantly, the reason for this action is to facilitate the process of accountability. This action involves a slight revision of the procedures for handling finance minutes outlined in report 291, which referred to only an annual tabling of finance minutes. The Committee believes that the overall process of accountability is aided by the prompt tabling of the finance minutes. This gives parliamentarians and the public an opportunity to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the responses of departments to particular concerns and recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. In turn, the Committee can only benefit from taking account of such comment when it considers the finance minute in detail at a later stage. The tabling of these minutes should not be taken to mean that the Committee is satisfied with the contents of them, as the Committee reserves the prerogative of conducting a detailed analysis of particular finance minutes at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA> As the House would be aware, there have been instances in the past when such analysis has led the Committee to a further formal inquiry. I stress the fact that, while detailed analysis of a particular finance minute may follow rather than proceed its tabling, this does not indicate that the Committee has reduced in any way its oversight of the responses to the report or indicate any reduction in the importance with which the Committee views the actual finance minute process. </PARA>
<PARA> The finance minutes I have tabled today deal with recent reports of the Public Accounts Committee, as I have outlined. I would like to take the opportunity very briefly to thank the members of the Committee. It is a very hardworking committee and has a very strong feeling of bipartisanship and duty to work on behalf of the taxpayers of this country. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the very hardworking and dedicated staff of the Public Accounts Committee for their many long hours of detailed thought and analysis in conjunction with the members of the Committee. I commend these three finance minutes to all members of the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Committee's fifty-third general report covers the activities of the Committee during 1989. It was, as always, a very busy year for the Committee. Twenty-six reports were tabled. This is the highest number of reports that the Committee has presented on domestic projects. The estimated cost of the proposals reported on by the Committee in 1989 was $1.1 billion. Sixty-eight meetings were held to conduct public hearings, carry out inspections, consider reports and other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of matters of concern to the Committee were raised in the report. First, there is the question of consultations between the departments or authorities and organisations or individuals who may be affected by proposed work. Far too often the consultative process is perceived as tokenism. The Committee believes meaningful consultation within realistic timeframes is essential during the development of any project. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the question of the provision of child-care facilities in Commonwealth office buildings. The situation now is that departments are able to provide child-care centres for employees subject to cost-neutral and accountability guidelines. This, the Committee believes, is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the question of environmental reviews. The Committee would like to reiterate what has been a longstanding practice. Any assessment of the environmental impact of a proposal should be completed before a proposal is referred to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to pay tribute to all members of the previous Committee who worked very hard throughout 1989. Senator Glen Sheil and Mr John Mountford have left the Parliament and I am grateful for their support during their service on the Committee. The honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) were also members of the Committee and are now Whips of their respective parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Special mention should be made of the former member for Wide Bay, Mr Clarrie Millar, who, as Vice-Chairman of the Committee, was an example to us all for his dedication to the work of the Committee. I should also to thank the hard-working secretariat, especially the Committee's Secretary, Mr Peter Roberts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has concluded that there is a need for the provision of a new computer centre for the Australian Taxation Office at Bruce, Australian Capital Territory. The proposed new centre will have an area of 6,300 square metres encompassing two levels. The mainframe computer will be on the upper level, while a number of support activities will be on the lower level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the need for a dedicated facility stems from a number of factors including a need for the Taxation Office to operate computer systems at two sites, the nature of existing facilities, especially at the Parkes site, and the modernisation program now under way within the Taxation Office and the non-availability of alternative accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending that the work proceed, the Committee believes that the Taxation Office and Australian Construction Services should review the requirement for dual independent power supplies to the building in view of the provision of substantial backup facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also focused attention on the question of the energy efficiency of the building. It was claimed that energy efficiency and management would be a prime consideration. The report notes that whilst measures will be included to produce an energy efficient building, there was no evidence of the magnitude of cost savings which these measures could produce. The Committee therefore gives notice that the inclusion of design and engineering principles designed to improve the energy efficiency in new buildings will be kept under careful scrutiny. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Brisbane Air Traffic Services Centre. </PARA>
<PARA>My colleague the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has endorsed a proposal by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to establish an air traffic service centre in Brisbane. The advent of satellite communication technology has provided the Civil Aviation Authority with the ability to centralise and rationalise airspace management over Australian and surrounding oceans to a number of strategically located centres. </PARA>
<PARA> The new centre is a vital component in the CAA airways productivity investment program as it will enable upgraded radar data to be displayed at new radar display consoles. It will also provide the necessary accommodation to permit consolidation and rationalisation of remote air services units into Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal being referred to the Committee will provide the necessary floor space to accommodate replacement radar displays as well as the functions currently provided by the existing Brisbane flight service centre and the flight service units at Charleville, Mount Isa, Weipa, Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Dubbo and Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is to rehabilitate the former Australian Airlines domestic terminal building located at the old Brisbane airport. The CAA has purchased 14 hectares of the airport, including the former Australian Airlines building, to enable it to ultimately consolidate and collocate all its off-airport activities at the one location. This proposal will be the first facility for this new CAA site. All future development will be independent of this proposal and subject to separate approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> The current proposal will provide a main building and adjoining annexes with a total floor area of approximately 6,000 square metres comprising 2,000 square metres of an air traffic services operational and support area. The central and largest single element will be the operational centre itself. All other areas will support this element. The operational training facility will be incorporated within this area. It will also comprise a 2,300 square metre technical services and support area. The equipment and maintenance areas are the important central elements of the technical services support facilities. They will include the required service-loading bay access and air handling areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1,100 square metres of services area will contain the electrical and mechanical equipment, including standby generating sets and air conditioning plant. There will also be a 600 square metre administrative support and social facility. This zone will contain amenities, as well as the focal point for public access to the centre. The administrative office will be immediately adjacent to the entry reception area. </PARA>
<PARA> The CAA's estimate for the proposals, including allowances for contingencies and fees is $9.7m at June 1990 prices. The proposal is being referred to the Committee at the schematic design stage as part of the CAA's fast-track implementation strategy which seeks to maximise economic benefits while honouring an undertaking given to the industry and industrial organisations. I table the drawings of the proposal and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition obviously supports this reference to the Public Works Committee. I would like to make a few brief comments in relation to this. Clearly, when there is an opportunity to rationalise the air services in this country we would agree that it should be taken. As has been pointed out by the Minister, the advent of satellite communication technology has provided the ability for the Civil Aviation Authority to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also point out that with the advent of deregulation there is probably a certain sense of urgency for this to be done, particularly as it may lead to further demands on the air traffic services. I point that out as the reference goes to the Public Works Committee. I also believe that the Civil Aviation Authority ought to take the opportunity to consult more with its employees. I understand that to date the consultation process has not been properly undertaken. This is causing some concern amongst employees and could lead to some problems if it is not addressed fairly quickly. I also understand that the employees do accept the need to rationalise, but nonetheless I think that their needs should be recognised and consultation should take place. Clearly, with the advent of new technology it is important that wherever possible we embrace this course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, this Bill is the Government's next major piece of anti-avoidance legislation. It contains provisions to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to the proposal, as announced in the economic statement of April 1989 and subsequent press statements. It will introduce an accruals system of taxing foreign source income that has been derived in low-tax countries by Australian controlled entities and has been accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. Exemption proposals in the Bill will also simplify the existing foreign tax credit system (FTCS). The Bill will generally have effect from the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA> An exposure draft of this Bill was released in June of this year following release of an initial draft in December last year. This Bill before the House is essentially the same as the June draft Bill. Many taxpayers and tax advisers who have an interest in the proposed legislation have provided constructive comment in response to the various policy documents and drafts of the legislation released over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of this consultative process, quite a number of significant changes were made between 1988 and 1990 to accommodate legitimate major concerns. For example, the control rule and active income exemption provided in the Bill were not policy features of the consultative document released in May 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> These and other policy changes have added considerably to the length and complexity of the Bill, but in general they have been made to take account of the genuine concerns expressed by those Australians to whom the legislation will apply. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some proposed changes that the Government could not accept because they would have left untouched tax avoidance opportunities the Government is seeking to close, or were inconsistent with the policy underlying the existing foreign tax credit system. The Government is firmly committed to these measures which will help significantly in the fight against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> For the great majority of Australians, those who do not have investments in offshore trusts and controlled foreign companies, this legislation will have no direct impact. There will be some beneficial effects for business in the exemptions and simplification of the FTCS. Development of a comprehensive system for taxing foreign income has been under way for some time. Under the law as it existed before this Government introduced the FTCS, Australian residents were exempt from tax in Australia on their foreign source income provided that income was taxed overseas, even if the income was subject only to a nominal rate of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step towards removing the bias that had encouraged Australians to invest in offshore tax havens rather than in their own country, this Government introduced the foreign tax credit system commencing from the 1987-88 income year. The system enables foreign income to be subject to Australian tax when it is remitted to Australia, with a credit being allowed for any foreign tax paid. It was acknowledged in the 1985 tax reform papers that the tax leakage through the use of tax havens would be closed off only if the FTCS was supported by a regime for taxing foreign source income derived in low-tax countries and being diverted and accumulated offshore in foreign companies and trusts. A number of other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand have already introduced similar measures to tax foreign source income on an accruals basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the more detailed aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Controlled Foreign Companies</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The main feature of this Bill is the controlled foreign company measures. Their aim is to attribute to Australian residents, with some exceptions, certain income derived by a non-resident company that is controlled by Australian residents, unless the company is subject to a tax system comparable to Australia's or is predominantly engaged in active business. </PARA>
<PARA> A foreign company will be a controlled foreign company, or a CFC, where five or fewer Australian residents own, or are entitled to acquire, 50 per cent or more of the interests in the company. The interest of a resident for this purpose will include both the direct and indirect interests of the resident and those of the resident's associates. Alternatively, a non-resident company will be a CFC if five or fewer residents have actual control of the company regardless of their shareholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a difference between the treatment accorded to non-resident companies in listed, that is, comparable-taxing, countries and unlisted countries. Even where a non-resident company in an unlisted country is controlled by a small number of Australian residents, its income or gains will not be attributed if the CFC's `tainted' income is less than 5 per cent of its total income. In other words, the measures will not apply if the CFC is predominantly engaged in active business. </PARA>
<PARA> However, if it fails the test, the tainted income of the CFC will be attributed to the relevant Australian residents. The other income is not attributed and will be subject to Australian tax under the FTCS generally on remittance to Australia. With CFCs resident in listed countries, low-taxed income may be attributed to certain of the CFC's Australian shareholders where it is tainted income that benefits from a tax concession of a kind that is to be prescribed by the income tax regulations and fails the active income test; in other cases the income is from sources outside the country of residence that is not taxed by any comparable tax country; or the company derives certain categories of trust income. </PARA>
<PARA> The countries that are to be treated as comparable tax countries, and the concessions that are to be treated as designated tax concessions, will be listed in the income tax regulations. Tainted income includes the types of income that are readily able to be shifted to a foreign tax jurisdiction. These consist of passive income-such as dividends, interest, royalties and most kinds of gains on the disposal of assets-and business income from transactions with Australian residents and related parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The assessable income of a shareholder who is an attributable taxpayer will include the taxpayer's share of the attributable income of the CFC for an accounting year of the CFC that commenced on or after 1 July 1990 and ended during the taxpayer's year of income. In most cases the residents who will be taxed are those who, alone or with associates, directly or indirectly hold an interest of 10 per cent or more in the CFC as at the end of the CFC's accounting year. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Tax Credit System</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the accruals tax measures provides an opportunity to simplify certain aspects of the existing FTCS. Accordingly, with effect from the commencement of the 1990-91 income year, an exemption is to be provided for non-portfolio dividends received by Australian companies from companies resident in comparable tax countries. A dividend will be a non-portfolio dividend where the Australian company that received the dividend has a voting interest of at least 10 per cent in the foreign company. It will not be necessary that the foreign company be a CFC. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Bill provides that a dividend received by an Australian company from a company resident in an unlisted non-comparable-tax country will be exempt where the dividend is paid out of income that has been comparably taxed in a listed country or income that has already been included in assessable income in Australia. Generally, other dividends are to continue to be assessable and subject to relief measures along the lines of the existing FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> The FTCS will also be modified to exempt from income tax, with effect from the commencement of the 1990-91 income year, the income or profits of a resident company derived in carrying on a business at or through a permanent establishment located in a listed country, except to the extent that the income or profits was not taxed (or is concessionally) taxed by any listed country. </PARA>
<PARA> Income of a resident company derived at or through a permanent establishment that is not located in a listed country is to continue to be subject to income tax, as is any branch income derived by a non-corporate taxpayer. Where foreign tax has been paid on branch income which is still assessable, a credit will continue to be allowed under the FTCS. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of technical amendments to the FTCS will also be made generally to accommodate the interaction of the accruals tax and the existing FTCS. These relate mainly to the definition of the classes of income, exemption of dividends paid out of attributed income, carry-forward of excess credits, and quarantining of losses and credits. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-Resident Trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another significant feature of this Bill is the transferor tax measures. These attribute income of non-resident trusts in low-tax countries to Australian residents who have, either directly or indirectly, transferred property or services to the trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of a discretionary trust that was in existence on 12 April 1989, an exemption from these measures will be available to a transferor if neither the transferor nor an associate of the transferor was able to control the trust on or after 12 April 1989. In this context, the term `control' is given a wide meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> The attributable income of a non-resident trust estate that is not a resident of a listed country is to be the whole of the net income of the trust. In the case of a trust that is a resident of a listed country the attributable income will be limited to that part of the net income of the trust that benefits from a designated tax concession. In both cases a deduction will be given for certain amounts that have been, or will be, subject to full taxation in Australia or in a listed country. </PARA>
<PARA> A deemed rate of return based generally on the value of property or services transferred to an offshore trust will be included in the assessable income of the transferor where the Commissioner is satisfied that the transferor is unable to obtain the information necessary to compute a trust's income according to Australian tax law. </PARA>
<PARA> Attributable income of a trust estate that has been included in the assessable income of a transferor will be exempt from tax in the hands of a beneficiary to whom that income is subsequently distributed. </PARA>
<PARA>Additional Tax on Certain Trust Distributions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that a resident beneficiary's assessable income for the 1990-91 or subsequent income year includes a distribution by a non-resident trust estate of income of previous years that has neither been attributed to a transferor nor taxed to the trustee or a beneficiary at tax rates comparable to Australia's, the beneficiary is to be liable, in certain circumstances, to pay an additional tax in the nature of an interest charge in respect of that amount. This measure will achieve a parity with resident trust estates, the net income of which is liable to tax either in the hands of the trustee or the beneficiaries in the income year it is derived. The charge is to be formally imposed by the Taxation (Interest on Non-resident Trust Distributions) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional tax in respect of income that accumulated in a non-resident trust prior to the beginning of the 1990-91 income year of the trust will accrue only from 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Certain Family Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The transferor tax measures will not apply in relation to an offshore trust that is solely for the benefit of family members in necessitous circumstances or is a family arrangement established under a court order following a divorce or separation. The beneficiaries of these trusts should all be non-residents. </PARA>
<PARA>Winding up of Existing Trusts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As an incentive to wind up non-resident discretionary trusts that were in existence on 12 April 1989 and to which a resident had transferred property or services prior to that date, a rebate of tax will be available so that the rate of Australian tax on distributions of income made after 12 April 1989 and before 30 June 1991 does not exceed 10 per cent. The rebate will apply only if all of the trust's accumulated income and corpus are distributed, and the trust is wound up before 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>Keeping of Records</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> An attributable taxpayer in relation to a controlled foreign company or a non-resident trust will be required to keep records that show how the CFC or transferor tax measures apply to the taxpayer. Generally, the records must be maintained for five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Information held Offshore</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to issue an offshore information notice in respect of information or documents held offshore. The proposed measures give 90 days to comply and the Commissioner can extend this time limit in special circumstances. Where the information or documents are not supplied there is no provision for a penalty or prosecution. Rather, the information or documents may not be used by the taxpayer as evidence to dispute an assessment. The approach adopted in this provision is similar to that taken in United States and Canadian tax laws and is aimed at ensuring the timely provision of all the information and documents needed by the Commissioner to get the full and correct picture of the transactions being examined. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the significance of such a provision, the operation of proposed section 264a will be kept under review to ensure that its objectives are met and that the rights of affected taxpayers are adequately protected. </PARA>
<PARA>Changes from Draft Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that the Bill varies in some respects from the draft that was released in June 1990. The broad thrust of these changes is to remove tax avoidance opportunities and provide relief in certain circumstances where double taxation could have occurred due to the application of the proposed measures. Some of the amendments relate to cases where double taxation could have arisen on a change of residence of a CFC or in relation to transfers of profits between companies. The amendments reflect the willingness of this Government to address genuine taxpayer concerns on an ongoing basis. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government is committed to the measures contained in this Bill as they will ensure a more equitable tax system. The Government is also committed to ensuring that these measures operate as intended. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all of the announced changes have been included in the Bill. The Government intends addressing the most urgent of these in an amending Bill to be introduced late in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the amendments are the result of the close monitoring of avoidance techniques that are being developed to frustrate the intent of the proposed measures. An example of this type of amendment is the redefinition of a non-resident family trust that is to be exempt from the accruals tax measures. Similarly, the exception from the deemed dividend provisions provided earlier for the investment by a CFC in the share capital of a wholly owned subsidiary is to be withdrawn if that subsidiary is being used to provide designated benefits to its associates. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, implementation of these measures will require consequential amendments to two other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as a consequence of the changes to the classes of income that are to apply for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxation Administration Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to ensure that a person cannot be prosecuted in respect of a statement made in a document produced to the Commissioner in response to an offshore information notice or under the active income test substantiation provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The likely direct revenue gain resulting from the introduction of the accruals system of taxing foreign source income is difficult to determine. This is particularly so in the initial years because of the variation in CFCs' accounting periods and taxpayers' years of income; the branch exemptions; and the tax exemption for non-portfolio dividends received by resident companies from a company that is a resident of a country with a tax system comparable to Australia's. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimating is made more difficult because it is not known to what extent non-resident discretionary trusts will be subject to the transferor tax measures or to what extent resident controllers will take advantage of the 10 per cent final tax liability by winding up before 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> While the revenue gains in 1990-91 are not expected to be significant, it is anticipated that the direct revenue gain will increase to within the range of $60m to $70m in 1993-94 after the full impact of these measures takes effect. In addition, the domestic tax base is expected to increase but the revenue impact cannot be quantified at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the consolidated explanatory memorandum for this Bill and the Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted yesterday by the lunch adjournment, I posed the question: what has been the Government's response to the inquiry into small business, the so-called Beddall report? I was particularly interested to find out what the Government's response was in that area of government regulation that most concerns small business, that is, its taxation recommendations. When the Beddall report came out the Government claimed that it was committed to the enacting of those recommendations. The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), as I understand it, placed his ministerial career on the line if those recommendations were not to be implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With this Budget we saw only three of a total of 66 recommendations acted upon, and I would like to refer briefly to those. Recommendation 28, which asks that the Australian Taxation Office reduce the remittance frequency of sales tax for qualifying small business from monthly to quarterly, formed the cornerstone of this Government's entire small business Budget strategy. As I said yesterday: big deal. This token gesture was limited to small businesses with sales tax bills of less than $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation which the Budget picks up was even less significant, with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) generously raising the threshold of small businesses annual rather than monthly remittances of fringe benefits tax from $1,000 to $3,000. This was another token gesture. Finally, we have the exemption from sales tax of computers used in manufacturing. This is extracted from recommendation 31 in the Beddall report, which recommends that the system of exemption from wholesale sales tax be reviewed and simplified. What has the Government done with this recommendation? It has thrown a review of the entire system into the too hard basket and offered a small panacea, another token response. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the report's call for a public and comprehensive review of the wholesale sales tax system? Or the recommendation which suggests that capital gains tax be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another? Or the recommendation which calls on the Government to undertake a fundamental review of the provisional and company tax system as it applies to small business? What of these recommendations and the others not directly related to taxation matters that provide the guidelines which will allow small business to flourish?</PARA>
<PARA> A recent survey by Arthur Andersen and Co. conducted among 2,500 small businesses found that there is a confidence crisis in the small business sector, with all companies surveyed finding it almost impossible to maintain sales revenue and profit levels. Most companies surveyed have recorded a drop in profit averaging 10 per cent over the last 12 months, and most small businesses expect that the domestic economy will contract over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer seems to have an uncanny ability to overlook the issues that really matter, the ones that could make the difference. Another glaring example of this is the lack of recognition given to tourism in this year's Budget. If the Government's token gesture for small business was a slight to the vital contribution it makes to the economy, then the treatment of tourism was insulting and showed incredible lack of forethought. Tourism is Australia's largest and most rapidly growing industry, earning $6.5 billion in foreign exchange last year. Unless Australia allows for expanded overseas promotion, we will be losing an opportunity to increase those export dollars and take a bigger share of the international tourism market than the very small share we now have. </PARA>
<PARA> Tourism is also our largest and most labour intensive employer. This should have special significance with unemployment rates increasing last month for the sixth month in a row and now reaching an annual average figure of 7.3 per cent. The potential of the tourist industry is staggering and largely untapped. Yet despite this and despite the former tourism Minister, the Hon. John Brown, calling for a Budget allocation of $100m for the Australian Tourism Commission, what do we get in the 1990-91 Budget? An allocation of a mere $40m, which was relatively the same amount that had been allocated for the previous two years. This is lagging terribly by world standards. Even the Government of Greece spent $150m last year on tourist promotion. Spain spent $105m and Tunisia spent $47m. So Australia is lagging behind even those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> What amazes me is that, despite the prominent role that the tourism industry plays in this economy, it receives no protection, no subsidies and relatively little direct assistance. In fact, of the amount the Government outlays in direct industry assistance, tourism receives only 2 per cent while manufacturing gets 18.7 per cent and agriculture gets 61.5 per cent. While the tourism industry neither seeks nor needs protection or government handouts, it makes sense for the Government to view its Budget allocation to the Australian Tourist Commission as an investment. While it keeps getting a continued return, it must reinvest to secure even greater returns for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate of McPherson encompasses Australia's tourist capital, the Gold Coast. There are many small businesses there and in other tourists destinations around our country which rely on business generated by visiting tourists. The Government's policies, its failures in economic management, its disastrous performance over the last seven years, have exacerbated the problems that most small business in tourism areas have encountered since last year's airline dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time I have remaining, I would like to make a short comment about another deficiency in the 1990-91 Budget in the context of the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in recent times about Australia being a clever country. In the light of the fact that even today the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) was attempting to justify during Question Time the Government's performance in respect of his area of responsibility, I find it interesting that once again the Government has treated shamefully the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). We find the Minister paying lip service only to the important role that CSIRO plays in the Australian economy and the Government once again is draining its budget by stealth each successive year. </PARA>
<PARA> As we begin a new decade and look towards the future, people desperately want to know where Australia is heading. They desperately want leadership, but this Government's policies are devoid of any positive direction. They are ideologically outdated, and the Government's 1990 Budget is a sad reflection of this outdated ideology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am Harry Woods and I am the new member for Page. As a businessman the north coast of New South Wales was good to me, and I am here because of that-to do my bit for the people of the north coast, particularly the people of Page, who had the confidence to elect me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The electorate was named in the 1984 electoral redistribution after the founder of the Country Party and former Prime Minister, Sir Earle Page. For the past 28 years it was held by the National and Country parties. The only former Labor member was Frank McGuren in the early 1960s. He died earlier this year, and I pay tribute to the service he gave to the people of the electorate. I acknowledge the efforts of the President of the Senate, Kerry Sibraa, in keeping the Australian Labor Party a strong force on the north coast of New South Wales in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Page is in the north-eastern corner of New South Wales in an area generally known as the Northern Rivers. Its major towns are Grafton, Casino, Ballina and Maclean, and there are many smaller inland and coastal towns and villages. The industries are mainly rural, but the coastal towns are experiencing high growth figures through tourism and the settlement of retirees. Most people find the climate of the Northern Rivers to be ideal-neither too hot nor too cold, but sometimes a little wet. It really is a beautiful part of Australia, and it is a constant source of amazement to me that this city of Canberra was not sited there-maybe at Rappville, Whiporie, Copmanhurst or one of the many other beautiful parts of my electorate. I can assure honourable members that they would be a lot happier if Canberra had been sited up my way; I certainly would be. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything would seem to be rosy, but there are problems and challenges in the Northern Rivers which are probably representative of many other rural areas of Australia. There are problems of very high unemployment and very low average incomes. These problems are accentuated in the Aboriginal community, and efforts need to be made for the advancement of Aborigines in my electorate. Discrimination does still exist and every effort should be made to change people's attitudes towards Aborigines, especially in regard to their employment. At Baryulgil, Aborigines live and play amongst the tailings of the town's former asbestos mine. It covers the streets and is in the school and pre-school playgrounds. It is in the air they breathe and the water they drink. It really is wrong, and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), during a recent visit, agreed that all levels of government should be doing everything in their power to make improvements. Thankfully the Federal Government has started to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The coastal towns of Ballina, Evans Head, Iluka, Woolgoolga and Yamba are popular tourist spots and have become increasingly popular retirement towns. With their rapidly expanding population of aged people, it is essential that their future needs be catered for. The inland towns of Grafton, Casino, Dorrigo and Kyogle suffer from negative or low population growth. Many of the problems they face can be traced to recent State Government cutbacks to services. One of the greatest hardships of these towns is that many people have to leave their families to find work or further their education. Country people have always faced hardships, and readily do so. But, as a Government striving to create a nation of equality, we should be making efforts to better their lot. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some disadvantages that country people should not have to face. In some of the major towns of my electorate the medical practitioners have joined forces and conspired not to bulk bill patients. They would not get away with it in a metropolitan area, where bulk billing is a success and on the increase. What many of the doctors are doing is lining their own pockets at the expense of pensioners and others who can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two reasons for that: one is political motivation and the other is greed. They expound other motives, but they are just trying to create a smokescreen. People on low incomes in these areas really need protection from this type of exploitation. Really, if we look at it properly, it is in this nation's interests to improve the lot of country people. The hard part, of course, is to identify services which will provide ongoing benefits for these areas without costing an inordinate amount. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate we have primary and secondary industries which are efficient and innovative-for example, the sugar industry. In the mid-1970s CSR Ltd dumped growers because it thought it was making insufficient profit. With the help of the former member for Clarence, Don Day, and the State Labor Government at the time, the growers bought the mills, introduced efficiencies and operated a profitable cooperative. When this Government rightly signalled the end of trade protection for sugar producers, the growers of northern New South Wales broke their traditional ties with the Queensland Sugar Board and decided to refine and market their own product. A refinery was constructed at Harwood in record time, and the growers are now reaping the results. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the biggest permanent fishing fleet in Australia. It is worth about $20m annually to the economy of the Northern Rivers. But there are problems. The present marketing system where prices are controlled by only a few people has resulted in fishermen getting lower returns than they should. Fishermen have little say over the environment that provides their income and holds their future prospects, namely, the rivers and the ocean. Many have large investments in boats and equipment and years of work in the industry but now find it difficult to make a living. The siltation of the rivers because of clearing upstream and particularly steep areas is of great concern to the industry. Fishermen are unable to get the taxation benefits available to other primary producers, and even within the industry there are anomalies, such as the ability to get a rebate on diesel fuel used for fishing but not on petrol used for the same purpose. The fishing industry, which has supported the Northern Rivers and other country areas of New South Wales so well over such a long period, really needs the support of this Government with policies to ensure its viability into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of our primary and secondary industries, though efficient, are not working to their capacity. Much of the problem is getting the goods, many of them for export, to markets. The problem is recognised by this Government. It is recognised by the recommendations of the national freight initiative and by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) through his interest in improving road links to major markets in the area. It is also recognised by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who visited the area recently and agreed with me that there was a need to reclassify the port of Clarence as a port of first entry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only by facing up to the challenges with positive policies that the problems of these country towns can be overcome. Lasting improvements do not come by one-off incentives by local councils for cheap land and the like; they come by improving access-that is, the roads, rail and ports-to those inland and coastal towns. These are the sorts of improvements needed in Page and in many other country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the question comes easily: Why are these things not better now on the north coast of New South Wales? Why are the roads not better? Why have the ordinary people I represent not had these improvements before? During my election campaign I asked those questions of the people of Grafton, Casino, Yamba and other areas in my electorate. They told me that it was not something that had happened in the past five or 10 years but over 20, 30 or 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Crook government services and infrastructure developed over many years. It is right that roads are built to last more than five years and ports are long term projects, as are railroads. The crook treatment we got was because of the style of representation we had received over a long period. The gripe of north coast people was the same as those involved in the Boston Tea Party, where the chant was, `No taxation without representation'. They were paying their taxes at the same rate and under the same conditions as everyone else, but they were being short-changed on the representation side. That was true of State and Federal representation for the area and was plain for all to see. It was true on the north coast of New South Wales and is still true in some other areas of country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Even my most vocal political opponents agree with me that an unhealthy and undesirable political atmosphere had developed on the north coast because one political party had exerted complete political dominance in the region for a very long time. This unhealthy atmosphere was demonstrated in the recent Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry which heard evidence of political bribery on the north coast of New South Wales. In Queensland, where the National Party dominated the scene for decades, evidence of political bribery was heard in the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct. This was the result of complete political dominance, of no political balance. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of my mates at home are members of the National Party. They are good people and completely honest, but they are disappointed. They are disappointed because the leaders and their representatives in the National Party have let them down. I am here as proof of that-and so is the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party was found wanting in its policy of promoting a huge pulp mill on the north coast on behalf of a foreign company in direct defiance of the known wishes of the people of that area. But its absolute stupidity knows no bounds. The National Party has recently resurrected an old goer to satisfy its bankrollers west of the range. Once again, it wants the northern rivers to be diverted to the west. This is despite negative reports in the past and the obvious opposition of north coast people and the cost to industries such as fishing and tourism. Let me tell honourable members now on behalf of the people I represent that I am totally opposed to the Clarence and Richmond rivers flowing west instead of east. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Party record on the environment is atrocious. The people know it, the Liberal Party knows it and we know it. The Labor Government has the runs on the board in regard to the environment; but we must not simply be happy with that. We have an ever-increasing ability to examine scientifically the results of actions we take, and we must use that ability to make informed decisions. With careful analysis we can make knowledgeable decisions and come up with proposals that will have a minimal effect on the environment but great benefits for the population. We must not lose sight of the need to leave this country fit for supporting further generations of Australians. Thorough examination of proposals, of costs and benefits where substantial damage is likely, is absolutely necessary. It is essential for the future of the timber industry on the north coast that the areas to be logged are defined and that logging is sustainable. In other words, we need to know the size of the resource and the rate at which we can harvest it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have grave doubts that the timber industry in New South Wales operates on a sustained yield basis. If we are to look forward to a long term, vibrant timber industry, harvesting must be done on a sustainable yield basis. In the past there has been overcutting, and it is debatable whether that is not still happening. It is in the interests of the timber industry and the workers in it that we are absolutely sure timber will be there to cut in the future. My doubts about this are well founded. The head of the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, Dr Drielsma, on 3 August admitted that the Forestry Commission is technically not working on a sustainable yield basis. He said that the forests of New South Wales were drastically overcut during the postwar decades. His Assistant Commissioner, Mr Fisher, said that sweetheart deals between politicians and timber millers had led to areas being cut that should have been left. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to protect the long term prospects of timber workers, timber harvesting must be sustainable. It does not matter how big or small the resource is; if it is not being cut on a sustainable basis, it is not a long term proposition. This must be done in a way that takes into account the overall requirements of the environment. By doing this openly we can resolve conflicts in the timber industry. Most people do not realise that we have on the north coast of New South Wales a substantial woodchip export industry; but it is operating without any environmental assessment. I assure the House that the majority of north coast people are rightly concerned about the effects of woodchipping operations on the north coast. Environmental impact statements need to be done in this industry. That will be in the long term interests of the industry and the jobs that it provides. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of the north coast of New South Wales do not want a five-star concrete strip created on their coastline. The Nationals created that type of development in Queensland, and it is now largely owned by overseas interests. We want development that allows our rivers and beaches to retain their natural beauty. In the long run that will be a far greater attraction for tourists than high-rise apartments and glitzy casinos. Above all, our Government's development policy should reflect the needs and wants of the people it will affect. </PARA>
<PARA> The largest private employer in my electorate is the Northern Cooperative Meat Company Ltd in Casino. It is operated by beef producers of the district, who are concerned about developments in the industry, particularly vertical integration by foreign firms, which buy into every level of the industry-from farm to abattoir, to packer and exporter. Those firms are able to export much of their profits, to the detriment of Australia, and to compete unfairly with Australian meatworks. The management of this cooperative is also gravely concerned about excessive overseas ownership of meatworks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While talking about foreign ownership of Australia, I should say that there is a growing concern among ordinary country people about foreign ownership of real estate. Many of them believe that our children will pay the price. Many foreign investors are interested only in speculative capital gains. That is not to the nation's good, as often it locks up finances that could be used for real purposes. Surely foreign ownership could be on a leasehold basis, which would encourage real investment. That could be done without compromising Australia's standing as a world trader. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I spoke of the need to improve the infrastructure, particularly roads, rail and ports in country areas. These things are essential if we are to make lasting improvements for country people. The handicap experienced by country areas relates to lack of easy access to markets for their products. If those barriers can be broken down, country Australia will thrive and Australia will thrive. Of course, the necessary ingredient in new or improved roads, rail or ports is capital, and large amounts of it. That raises the question: where does the money come from? We have to consider the best way to use the capital assets of our nation. Should the capital of public assets be tied up in facilities that can be operated just as well by private enterprise or is it better to invest that capital in facilities in which private enterprise cannot or will not invest?</PARA>
<PARA> By nature many assets of this country are the domain of government. They will not be renewed or improved by the private sector. Prime examples of these are roads, rail and ports. The benefit to our exports from providing those facilities are just as tangible as investment in such things as airlines, though not as easily quantifiable. It is on that basis that this Government should consider transferring its investment from those things the private sector can operate to those which only the Government can. We can use the finances saved in this way to rebuild the infrastructure of this country, which has been allowed to slip over the past 30 or 40 years. The choices we make must be made on the basis of financial benefit to Australia. Country areas will be among the main beneficiaries if decisions are made properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on a bipartisan basis the support of the vast majority of the people of Page for his and this Government's stand on the crisis in Iraq. History warns of the price of inaction, and to allow Saddam Hussein to control a large slice of the world's oil reserves would be tantamount to selling our children into slavery. Saddam Hussein must be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to be here as a member of the Australian Labor Party. I am proud of the achievements of the Hawke Labor Government. I am proud of Medicare, Skillshare and of programs for the disadvantaged and the elderly, and the wages accord. I am proud that Kakadu has been saved, that Bass Strait is not polluted and that the Barrier Reef is safe. I am proud of the 1.6 million jobs created under the Hawke Government. I am proud that it was this Government that had the guts to bring in the hard decisions that have taken this country from one with a policy of unworkable protectionism to one striving to be competitive as a world trader. It is now widely accepted that those years of protectionism are the major cause of today's economic woes, and it is seen that Labor is the only party with the guts and the people to bring the nation through this testing time. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I thank the people of Page who put me here. I will never give them the opportunity to criticise me for lack of effort. I thank the branch members of the Australian Labor Party in my electorate. Without their untiring support I would not be here today. I thank them also for their attendance today. The ordinary country people of the Northern Rivers of New South Wales have given the Labor Party the chance to show them that it is able to represent them well in Federal Parliament. We on this side of the House have an ability to show the average country people of Australia the benefits of strong Labor representation and that it is in the interests of the rural folk to be represented by Labor. The Nationals have demonstrated that they are unable and unwilling to do the job. They are unwilling because they represent vested interests and not the ordinary people. They are unable and powerless because they are nothing more than a lap-dog on the knees of their Liberal masters. </PARA>
<PARA> Country people know that they can expect nothing from the Liberal Party, controlled as it is by the big business interests of this nation. Country people know that the Labor Party is their best chance of a fair go. Let us show them that their faith in us is well founded. If we do that, we will set an example for all country areas and reap the benefits at the next Federal election. The Labor Party is the natural political party of rural Australia, and it will be rural Australia that puts Labor into a fifth consecutive term of government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege to represent the electorate of Dunkley. I thank all of those whose support was so great-my wife and family, our friends, my electorate chairman, Mrs Flo Parnaby, and the team who worked tirelessly to bring our campaign to a successful conclusion. Of course, I thank also the voters of the electorate. The State Secretariat of the Liberal Party needs special mention for its support. As the gateway to the Mornington Peninsula on the east coast of Port Phillip Bay, Dunkley is an area of many facets. From Mount Eliza in the south to Chelsea in the north, stretching approximately four kilometres inland, the area provides a perfect setting for water sports, while the historic features, art galleries and varied sporting facilities create enjoyment for residents and visitors alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although mainly small to medium in size, business ventures of many varieties have developed over the years. The electorate is a great mirror of our society as a whole, though the emerging picture can be described only as bleak. There are many newspaper reports of increased serious crime. Housing figures show that new house approvals decreased from 747 in June 1989 to 456 a year later-a drop of just on 40 per cent. Around the central business district of Frankston one or two shops are empty in almost every block. Scores of empty offices and more than 100 industrial buildings stand empty, monuments to the days when success was commonplace and to be admired. </PARA>
<PARA> With my background in small business as a manufacturer and my involvement in small business employer organisations, particularly the Australian Small Business Association, it troubles me deeply that this once rich country is stagnating economically and is in a recession-even on the verge of a depression-with nearly 630,000 Australians listed as unemployed and small to medium sized businesses going bankrupt at an alarming rate. Many are old, established businesses, not newly created businesses that tend to fail even in good times. Our business base is being destroyed. We should give consideration to the introduction of a version of the United States chapter 11 mechanism which enables businesses to seek protection against bankruptcy proceedings and allows them the opportunity to trade out of their debts. </PARA>
<PARA> Business proprietors must realise that failure can occur at any time. If government or bureaucracy-that is, Big Brother-decides that a proprietor or his or her industry are irrelevant, both will be sacrificed without a second thought. My small engineering business was in such an industry. It was obliterated by the 1987 Budget without warning or consultation. Recovery is nearly impossible and takes years of sleepless nights, worry and family tension-a miserable existence one would not wish upon one's worst enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there are thousands of people, not only in small business, caught in a trap by inconsistent policies and high interest rates, and their plight is ignored. I believe that the pain we are experiencing is unnecessary. We have been badly served by this Government, with its concentration on high interest rates as the only means of correcting the imbalance in our balance of trade. The tragedy is that the people who are hardest hit by high interest rates-that is, the pensioners, families, war veterans, the handicapped and people on fixed incomes-do not purchase or consume any imports. After outlaying most of their income on food and high housing rents, these people have little money left with which to purchase imports. There are many such people in the electorate of Dunkley who have been badly hurt by these high interest rate policies. They deserve, and will demand, better. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing has been done to significantly free up the labour market or improve the efficiency on our waterfront. During May and June this year waterfront disputes, affecting 85 vessels, cost the nation an estimated $10m. Yet these very people will be rewarded with $100,000 each under the Government's proposed retirement arrangements. Is it any wonder that the average person in the community is disillusioned?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the unions have made a lot of noise about reforming the labour market, but until we get genuine voluntary agreements between employers and employees at the enterprise level we will continue along the same inefficient path that we have been following for decades. We must allow management and workers to instigate flexible work practices which lead to greater productivity and cost savings. This is in stark contrast to award restructuring which has, to date, been an excuse for wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now a part of a global economy and the cold facts are that we cannot compete because our costs are too high. In Australia, the best examples of greatly improved productivity concern companies and employees which have negotiated their own working conditions, such as Mudginberri, Robe River and, more recently, the Power Brewery in Queensland. The Power Brewery employees are receiving more money than people working at the competition brewery, yet they often earn it in just four days. The company is happy and so are the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement now appears to be under threat from the Goss Government. At the instigation of the Federated Liquor and Allied Industry Employees Union, Mr Goss is prepared to force the management of Power Brewery to forgo a massive productivity increase of-I stress this figure-80 per cent more beer per person. If every business in this country could lift its productivity by even a quarter of this amount we would reverse our balance of payments overnight. This voluntary enterprise agreement is one of 60 that were ratified under the former National Party Government which Mr Goss has ordered to cease as at 30 December this year. Does the Treasurer (Mr Keating) agree with Mr Goss? Is this what the Treasurer means when he urges us all to increase productivity?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the most glossed-over problems facing this country is, I believe, our high inflation rate. It takes a heavy toll on business, discourages average Australians from saving and erodes the purchasing power of low income citizens- particularly families and those on fixed incomes, such as pensioners and war veterans. Our inflation rate is currently about 8 per cent, which is twice that of our trading partners. The major cause of inflation in Australia is this Government's now discredited prices and incomes accord. This unholy alliance between government and union leaders has had the effect of granting wage rises not related to productivity. This, in turn, has caused prices to rise and has also led to a lowering of quality, particularly in our manufacturing sector, as companies attempt to cut costs. This has not helped our efforts as an exporting nation; nor has it helped import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> With indexed wage rises and indexed government charges and duties, we are guaranteed high, virtually indexed, inflation. Until we can bring our inflation down to the same level as our major trading partners we will continue our slide towards a banana republic. There is an old Latin proverb that says `time discovers truth', and the longer Australia's economic woes continue, the sooner we will hear the faint but final gasps of the Prime Minister's accord. </PARA>
<PARA> It would appear that one of the Government's most enthusiastic fellow travellers among the employer groups has forsaken it. It was reported in the Melbourne Age newspaper on Thursday, 16 August that the Metal Trades Industry Association (MTIA) appeared to be having second thoughts about the latest accord mark 6. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Victorian director of the M.T.I.A., Mr Bob Herbert, said the manufacturing industry had to be put in a ``separate basket''. </PARA>
<PARA>The article stated that Mr Herbert had said that the MTIA saw `considerable shortcomings' with accord mark 6. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>``Our approach is that it provides too much of a stop-start approach to wage fixation'', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I well remember back in the early 1980s when I was a member of that organisation, attending meetings at which members were asked to ratify the MTIA agreement with the unions for a 38-hour week and two huge wage rises. I disagreed with the MTIA for caving in under pressure and forecast that it would decimate the manufacturing industry. I regret to say that I was right. Close to 200,000 jobs have been lost, mainly in large engineering companies which have now ceased operations. This has made it almost impossible for many large engineering projects to be carried out in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Mr Herbert, when speaking of the manufacturing industry on 16 August in terms of putting it in a separate basket, omitted the final word, which is `case'. Manufacturing is a basket case, due in no small measure to the original agreement struck between the MTIA and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union which was ratified by the then Arbitration Commission. Clearly, the accord must go, although whenever someone mentions freeing up the labour market there is an excited little chorus from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his colleagues about returning to the laws of the jungle. We should not return to the laws of the jungle or tribunals; we must return to real law with real evidence before real judges if, indeed, the law is required. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of allowing for a more natural flow of supply and demand in the market place, Labor's interventionist activities are destroying the lives of many people who voted for it. As research by the Institute of Public Affairs reveals, since 1982, allowing for inflation, the average after tax earnings of Australians have actually decreased by almost $2,000. For some, the current year will be disastrous. The Budget last month promised a 9.2 per cent increase in pay as you earn collections, so the immediate future looks grim for employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been stated that there is no perfect system. Yet the system of free enterprise is a granting of opportunity for personal liberty and independence to be passed on to future generations. It is both the cause and effect of individual freedom. The debt-ridden results of recent years will take at least a generation to rectify. Australia has an enormous overseas debt and huge unfunded liabilities in government superannuation schemes, both State and Federal. Each year that goes by the debt increases. By the end of the financial year just completed, it was worse than the last, which in turn was worse than the previous year and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The lucky country is no longer. Instead, we have been told by the Prime Minister that we must become the clever country. One would hope, after the past seven years, that we will also emerge the wise country. Policies that are compatible with a healthy future will encourage excellence, initiative and competition at all levels. The Treasurer has persisted in high interest rates because he either could not or would not accept the alternatives of reforming taxation, reforming the labour market and cutting spending. All those countries producing goods at a lower price than Australia must be pleased with his efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of that quotation by Austin O'Malley, who said, `Some men are like a clock on a roof-they are useful only to their neighbours'. Apart from being known around the world as the land of the long weekend, it would appear that in the eyes of Asian investors we have been dragged into disrepute. According to former Builders Labourers Federation Secretary Mr Joe Owens, Asian investors do not agree with the way Australian construction unions conduct themselves. I wonder why?</PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1970s, I was privileged to be part of a team establishing a large aluminium fabricating facility in Indonesia. Not only did we give the international competitors a six-month start, but we were also first into production and produced better quality products. It is not possible to compare Australian management with management in overseas countries, except when working in the same environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The business environment in Australia is one of the most hostile and most regulated anywhere in the world. Generally, we have an excellent work force. Although I have heard a lot of rubbish spoken on the subject of so-called inefficient business, we do compare favourably with businesses around South East Asia, given our restrictive business environment. On the management side, with a few exceptions Australia is more than a match for many overseas countries. Had we the freedom and the conditions to operate sensibly, Australia could and would regain its position in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, there have been some businessmen-only a few, the so-called high-flying entrepreneurs who have since crashed to earth-who have brought Australian business into disrepute. I regard the 1980s as the decade of greed, when entrepreneurs borrowed huge sums of money both within Australia and overseas and then proceeded with paper shuffling and dubious takeovers to be held up by the media and others as successful role models. We have all seen the end result of their behaviour and the effect it has had on Australia's international credibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Far worse, I believe, is the example such behaviour has been for our young people. These entrepreneurs who produced nothing were feted as successful while the struggling small business men or women who were actually trying to manufacture goods or services, research and develop products and employ fellow Australians, were regarded as fools and failures for toiling for long hours for very small returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that the ordinary man and woman in the street feel disinclined to start at the bottom and work their way up? It has looked all too easy to get rich quick. We have to get back to basics and encourage people, especially the young, to realise one cannot get something for nothing. Success comes only from hard work and personal sacrifice. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the 1990s must be a period of reconstruction, of examining our values and finding a way forward into a future which will benefit our children and our grandchildren. Excellence, competition, profit and individual responsibility must cease to be dirty words. Effort must be rewarded. </PARA>
<PARA> Our school system must suit the times. Of real concern is the experiment in social engineering called the Victorian Certificate of Education which is being foisted on our secondary school students in Victora. This is the brainchild of the Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner, and aims for equality of outcomes. This, I fear, means a lowering of standards, and already some tertiary institutions are expressing disquiet. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Prime Minister that Australia must become a clever country, but we will not do it by spending huge sums on a multifunction polis (MFP) when our existing research organisations are starved for funds. Several weeks ago, I spent two hours at the proposed site of the multifunction polis situated 25 kilometres out of Adelaide. If we are to have an MFP, what a place-a reclaimed mosquito-ridden swamp, a toxic waste dump and adjacent to the submarine construction area, the Osborne power station and a huge chemical complex. Personally, it is not an area in which I would choose to live. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, we must encourage our young people, especially our young men, to become qualified in the fields of engineering and science. We must create a friendly atmosphere for business, universities, colleges and research establishments so that they have the money and the confidence to research new ideas. Australian scientists are among the best in the world. We do not need to import vast numbers from overseas. We just need to give our own people more encouragement so they will not leave this country for more attractive careers overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990s will be a decade of great challenge, especially in view of the exciting changes which are taking place in eastern Europe. This will mean a lot more global competition and we must be ready to accept the challenge. We must develop our natural resources, bearing in mind at all times our concern for the environment. We can have sensible policies for sustainable development, for without them our standard of living will slip further and further behind as we reach the stage when we can no longer maintain our pleasant lifestyle on the savings of foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA> Several months ago, I visited Kakadu, where I spent two days at Coronation Hill and the surrounding area, staying overnight at the El Sharana mining camp. If ever a project has received shabby, unfair treatment and bad publicity, it is Coronation Hill. The partners in this venture had fulfilled all the environmental impact requirements and had reasonably assumed that the project could go ahead. Now for reasons of purely politically expediency, I believe, the whole project is to be subjected to yet more investigation by the Resource Assessment Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I was staggered at the number of mainly Federal Government bureaucracies which are involved in the evaluation process. To my mind, all this bureaucratic interference is contributing to many mining companies being involved in projects offshore. While I was there I spoke to a representative from the local Jawoyn people, a caring and thoughtful man who was particularly worried about the future of the local children. He fully understood the importance of the project going ahead and the benefits which were likely to accrue to his people. There is very little industry in this part of northern Australia and jobs are very difficult to find. We must nurture our most precious resource of all, our young people, and see that they have every opportunity to take up the great challenges facing this country in this last decade of the twentieth century and on into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to see future generations have the same opportunities that were available to me. This was one of the motivating factors in my decision to enter politics. Leaving a huge overseas debt and similar unfunded liabilities is of great concern. As a nation we must not be reluctant to deal with values. If we are to develop in our children affection and a patriotism for Australia, we must first develop a philosophy that does not contradict the outcome we desire. </PARA>
<PARA> We members of this chamber must hold to the principles of democracy. We must not be found wanting in discharging our duty to see that the nation is well administered. We must address our fundamental problems: industrial relations, inflation, interest rates, taxation, education and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I look forward to being part of a coalition led by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), which will set about rebuilding the confidence of our people and making our great country, Australia, a happier and more prosperous place. I believe I am currently the only member whose namesake was a former Prime Minister, Mr Frank Forde. There are two not so insignificant differences: firstly, the spelling of our names and, secondly, our political philosophies. He may not have agreed with everything I have said here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extend my congratulations to the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford). The Hawke Federal Labor Government has a very good record of change and policy implementation in many areas in its eight Budgets. Like many governments it has also made a number of errors which, of course, deserve to be rectified. There are many pluses. For example, by 1989-90 the 1983-84 Budget deficit of 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) had been turned around to a 2.6 per cent surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Employment growth has averaged 3.5 per cent per year compared with an average of 1.7 per cent in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries over the past seven years. Primarily, this has been due to wage restraint by wage and salary earners and the trade unions. For example, in 1989-90, wage growth was 6.5 per cent against an 8 per cent consumer price index (CPI) increase. On average, in 1989 the four OECD European majors experienced a 6 per cent wage increase as against a 3.6 per cent increase in inflation; that is, real wages in those OECD countries increased much faster than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One can also be proud of the tax reform program of the Hawke Labor Government. The introduction of the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax in 1985 and the income tax restructuring in 1985, 1989 and 1990 are most commendable. For example, the latest instalment of tax cuts delivers an extra $2.5 billion to wage and salary earners over a full year and still maintains an estimated $8.1 billion surplus in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> In child-care this Budget delivers $87m towards the promised program of establishing 80,000 new places by 1995. Of course, the improvements to social welfare are well documented. The tightly targeted family allowance and family allowance supplement programs are welcomed, as are the changes which coordinated the tax payment threshold with the pension income-test-free area. </PARA>
<PARA> Higher education is a policy plus, as exemplified by the increasing number of university places which are available in Australia. For example, the University of Wollongong, a major regional university, has increased its student numbers from 3,500 to nearly 9,000 during the Hawke Labor years. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some problem areas in the Budget for the Government and the nation. Firstly, I refer to the continued current account deficit and the associated problem of repayment of principal and interest on foreign debt. These repayments have been the main debilitating influence on the current account. It is increasingly a private sector issue. Over the years since deregulation of the financial system, the public sector borrowing requirement has been, of course, cut to zero. In the last financial year alone, $6 billion of domestic debt and $2.5 billion of overseas debt have been repaid as a result of Budget surpluses. Over four years Federal debt is down from 26.5 per cent of gross domestic product to 13 per cent of GDP. So Commonwealth-held debt is reducing. The majority of the record $127 billion net foreign debt is now held by the Australian private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not so much trade deficits, but net income deficits, including foreign debt repayments, which are the main factor in the high current account deficits. As the Budget Papers show, trade deficits have declined in real terms from $3.5 billion in 1985-86 to $3.8 billion in 1989-90, whilst net income deficits have increased from $8 billion to almost $16 billion over the past four years. Honourable members can trace these figures in more detail in Budget Paper No. 1, section two, page 25. They will see, for example, that in the first half of the financial year 1989-90, the trade account was $3.4 billion in deficit and in the second part of the year only $0.4 billion in deficit. In the net income balance area the net deficit was $7.4 billion in the first half of the year, rising to $8.3 billion in the second half of the year. This means that imports, as a result of high interest rates depressing the economy, have decreased, but the current account deficit is still a very severe problem, mainly because of the fact that net income imbalances are still very much in deficit. They are blowing out as a result of the repayment of principal and interest on foreign debt, not as a result of a surge in imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The misconception of late that import costs are paramount in the current account deficit has led to an over-reliance on tight monetary policy leading to high real interest rates and an extravagantly overvalued Australian dollar. In effect, we are seeing the first deliberate policy-induced recession since the 1961 credit squeeze. Furthermore, this position will be exacerbated by external conditions, in part resulting from the crisis in the Persian Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> So one comes to the weakest points, in my view, of the 1990-91 Budget. I refer to the basic and key Budget forecasts. Of course, these were: total demand rated to be zero; exports to increase by 7.5 per cent; imports down by 3 per cent; gross domestic product plus 2 per cent-seeing that zero growth is predicted in demand this means that that 2 per cent has to come from exports alone; I will return to that in a moment-unemployment predicted to rise to 7.25 per cent; and consumer price index increases to even out at 6 per cent some time towards the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at these figures. Given that total domestic demand for 1990-91 is forecast to be zero, I think it is extremely unlikely that gross domestic product will amount to a total of 2 per cent derived from export growth alone in 1990-91. High real interest rates, favourable terms of trade and now capital inflow as a result of the Persian Gulf situation has produced an Australian dollar which is far too high to allow the 7.5 per cent increase in export revenue predicted in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I just digress slightly from that theme to point out that Ronald Reagan's early eighties policies of big tax cuts and high interest rates and an overvalued US dollar have been identified by economists in the US Treasury-this was to me personally about five weeks ago-as having led to the huge US budgetary and trade deficits that we see today. In Australia, despite the tax cuts, as I have said, very tight fiscal policies have led to Budget surpluses, unlike the early Reagan years, but tight monetary policies, high interest rates and an overvalued dollar are contributing to our trade deficits. Our trade deficits are then hugely compounded by repayment of interest and principal on private sector public debt. As I have pointed out, public sector foreign debt is decreasing as a percentage of total foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA> There are signals, other than the effect of an overvalued Australian dollar and exports, that growth will be less than 2 per cent. The Budget forecasts are based on oil priced at $23 per barrel. Already it is $27 per barrel and it could rise higher, depending on the situation in the Persian Gulf. Further, OECD forecasts in June, before the Gulf crisis, predicted 3.8 per cent average growth and 4.3 per cent inflation for the four OECD European majors. </PARA>
<PARA> The OECD report also predicted US growth of 2.3 per cent and inflation of 4.5 per cent in the United States. Since the Gulf crisis, the growth figures have been revised downwards, on average, by 1.3 per cent and inflation forecasts increased by 1.5 per cent. All the information is in the OECD's latest report which, I point out, was brought out a few days before the Gulf crisis; nevertheless, as I have just said, the figures have been revised downwards. Given all that, the OECD is now looking, on average, at 3 per cent gross domestic product growth or less; in the US, one per cent or less. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very unlikely that Australia will reach 2 per cent growth in GDP, given the low level of domestic demand predicted in the Budget and the bearish outlook for most exports. I include in the description `bearish' manufacturing industry exports and agricultural products but, of course, exclude energy related products such as liquefied natural gas and steaming coal. </PARA>
<PARA> If the GDP forecasts fall to something between zero and one per cent in Australia for 1990-91 other basic forecasts will also change. The surplus could be less than predicted and unemployment could be a good deal higher. The rise in unemployment is most worrying to me and should be of great concern to the trade unions in the current wages environment. It would be unfair if wage and salary earners in the smaller and weaker unions missed out on the 1990-91 accord mark 6 as a result of higher unemployment bearing down hard on the labour market, and the ACTU should note the deteriorating position in finalising accord mark 6. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of recipients of unemployment benefits has increased by 90,000 since last November. Unemployment is now over 620,000, a jobless rate of 7.3 per cent. That already equals the Budget average forecast for the whole year. If unemployment were to blow out to, say, 8.5 per cent we are looking at another 100,000 unemployed on top of the 70,000 inferred in the Budget figures. The Confederation of Australian Industry is pessimistic about Australian manufacturing in its latest joint report with Westpac Banking Corporation, and the Metal Trades Industry Association says that 30,000 jobs have been lost in the metal industry in the last three months. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the scenario that I have painted turns out to be incorrect, but unfortunately I think it is a probable outcome unless official rates and bank prime and housing rates are eased significantly in the near future. Of course, that is what needs to be done. I accept that this will be no easy task, given that the international economic trends are probably running in the opposite direction. In the United States, Federal savings and loan bail-out problems will cost taxpayers $200 billion plus over the next several years. There are international costs associated with the Persian Gulf military expeditions and higher oil prices resulting from the Gulf crisis following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Further, there is the impost on international capital markets, particularly in Europe and Japan, which arise from the recapitalisation of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> I predict that United States deficits will remain stubbornly high and West German and Japanese surpluses will surely gradually run down. All this leads to higher world interest rate regimes. I say this despite the over-optimistic commercial view from the commercial bank joyboys that I have read in the last few days that US and world rates are due to fall. They may fall slightly in the short term, but there is no possibility that we are looking at an international regime of lower interest rates in the intermediate and long term, given the combination of factors I have just spelled out. Nevertheless it remains imperative that Australian real interest rates and the Australian dollar be reduced to a more realistic level, otherwise we face a rapidly sinking economy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the need to reduce interest rates, it is difficult to see privatisation making a significant contribution to micro-economic reform. Privatisation of major government business enterprises places heavy demands on domestic savings and means a certain increase to our already overloaded foreign debt. It is certain to put upward pressure on domestic interest rates-just the opposite of what is required. The real economic issues facing us are the need for lower interest rates and a lower Australian dollar, how to increase domestic savings, how to encourage exports and how to restrain foreign debt. They are the real issues, not privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe micro-economic reform, particularly in transport and communications, is essential, but improved industry efficiency and competitiveness is not necessarily derived from privatisation. That privatisation can be a cop-out rather than true micro-economic reform is unarguable. It can impose heavy strains on capital markets. For example, the Opposition's plans to totally privatise Telecom Australia, OTC Ltd, Aussat Pty Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd would make a $20 billion call on domestic and overseas capital markets. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, current Government privatisation and communication reform plans affecting OTC, the airlines and the Commonwealth Bank would impose a significant amount also in capital markets-say, approximately $5 billion plus. I think all this would push up interest rates and increase foreign debt. At the very least privatisation merely transfers private sector savings to the public sector. It transfers the task of raising funds, for example, for new equipment and technology to the private sector; it does not in itself make an industry more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, privatisation is a Clayton's micro-reform. It is the sort of micro-reform you have when you are not having real micro-economic reform. There is no reason why the airlines equipment and equity requirements cannot be met from their own cash flows, borrowings from the Loan Council and moderate injections of government equity. As economists have pointed out, if the revenue return to government from such investments exceeds the cost of interest payments on borrowings, the investment is commercially sound. Indeed, that is how the private sector operates-or how it ought to operate even if it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current propositions affecting communications, the Commonwealth Bank and the airlines, only the plans to improve efficiency and competitiveness in communications can be designated as true micro-economic reform. I favour the merging of Telecom and OTC. Aussat can provide the basis for a second competitive carrier. Competition could be allowed on overseas communications and in the value added areas such as mobile phones and business communications but not against the public switch telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA> I know this is a controversial issue, but I cannot for the life of me see how a second carrier connection with the existing public switch telephone network automatically gives increased competition and lower tariffs. If it does, the capacity must already exist for Telecom to reduce charges. In that case, why should an overseas corporation freeload on investment by Australian taxpayers? If it is intended to create a second separate network over a long period of time I cannot see why such wasteful duplication of investment is necessary, given the heavy demands on our savings that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, always refers to. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas ownership should not exceed approximately 30 per cent after a reasonable period. I think an outcome such as I have described in communications creates a fully publicly owned Australian megacom in competition with a second carrier in all areas except the public switch telephone network. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike communications reform, the acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, financed by a 30 per cent sale of new equity to the private sector, is not micro-reform in my view but sheer expediency. The acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria can be funded easily by means other than partial privatisation such as drawing upon excess Commonwealth Bank contributions to the Commonwealth Bank Employees Superannuation Fund. In no way, in my view, can the Commonwealth Bank deal be presented as making the bank more efficient or creating more competition in the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the State Bank of Victoria, it has been the private sector financial institutions, including the major private banks, who have lent recklessly, in the process amassing huge portfolios of bad debt. In comparison, the publicly owned Commonwealth Bank has been a model of financial rectitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I had intended to say more about the airlines but I will not have time. Suffice it to say that the best thing we could do in micro-reform in the airlines industry is to merge Australian Airlines and Qantas. That is the real way to introduce competition in the domestic aviation commuter industry. There is no doubt about that. The privatisation of Australian Airlines in itself-either 100 per cent or 49 per cent-will not produce true competition in the domestic aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: there are many initiatives and programs in this Budget of which we can be truly proud. But I do think that the Budget's key forecasts are questionable and our key economic priorities ought to be to get interest rates down and to get the Australian dollar down. Then we can take the true place that we deserve in our region and the world with regard to trade and foreign policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not the first time that I have followed the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) in a debate. In fact, there was a time in our respective careers when I responded quite regularly to what he had to say. As I listened to him talk about the Budget today I wondered for a time whether we had some form of conversion on our hands. We know that the honourable member for Cunningham has long held the view that Budget deficits were a highly desirable way in which to conduct our economic affairs, but today I heard him say that he was delighted to see a Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wondered whether we had a conversion when the honourable member started to criticise this Budget that I will be talking about in a minute. I am afraid that I was misguided because the honourable member for Cunningham did not waste too much time before he got back to the things that he really does like to talk about-belting the private sector, belting deregulation of the financial market and, last of all, having a go at privatisation. I say to the honourable member for Cunningham that privatisation is not the only thing that needs to be done to restore Australia's economic position, but it is one of the things that needs to be done. It joins a list of about 15 or 20 things that need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member that he will have his chance in this chamber to decide whether he wants to live up to what he has said today. He will have a chance to vote against legislation that will be required to give effect to his Government's decisions on privatisation. He will have a chance to vote against a 30 per cent private shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank. It will be interesting to see, when he has that chance, whether he takes it. I say to the honourable member for Cunningham that, if he does vote against that legislation and joins some of his other colleagues who have his disposition, although his career in the Labor Party will be short, at least he will be highly regarded for having the courage of his convictions. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say one other thing in relation to what the honourable member for Cunningham had to say about the public sector borrowing requirement. He said that the public sector borrowing requirement would be at zero. He then went on to identify a whole series of weak links in this year's Budget. He will know that yesterday, in response to a dorothy dix question, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said that he was lifting the ceiling on borrowings that would be allowed for the Australian Wool Corporation. If current trends continue, the Australian Wool Corporation will have to borrow an extra $2 billion in order to fund the wool stockpile. That will right there and then blow out the public sector borrowing requirement by about one half of a percentage point of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the honourable member for Cunningham for his contribution to the Budget debate. It was a little all over the place, but I guess I have come to expect that from the honourable member. </PARA>
<PARA> By now we know that every time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gets into trouble he blames someone else. He has been true to form with this 1990-91 Budget. There is clearly something seriously wrong with the Budget because in the few weeks since it was brought down-it has been widely described as an anticlimax-the Treasurer has lashed out wildly. To start with he blamed the media, which is extraordinary, given the way that he has manipulated and tried to manipulate the media over the years. Not content with blaming the media generally, he turned his attention to the Melbourne Age newspaper and gave it and several of its commentators a sound lashing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer then blamed the banks for the excesses of the recent boom that he, the Treasurer, helped to fuel with his loose monetary policy. Then it was the turn of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Opposition generally. In the last few days it has been the turn of his own colleagues. At a recent meeting to discuss telecommunications competition and airline funding matters, both of which we were led to believe some months ago would be included in the Budget but neither of which were, he described his colleagues as hopeless and stormed out of the meeting to talk to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and presumably give it a blast. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism of the Budget brought forth the Treasurer's reaction, but it is now clear that those criticisms are well-founded. The Budget is a flawed and most peculiar document. Huge amounts of it seem to have been left out, almost as if the Treasury computer lost some of the pages or chapters in the print-out. There is, for example, hardly a word about our exchange rate. I thought it was quite interesting today that the honourable member for Cunningham spent several minutes talking about the exchange rate, but there is hardly anything about the exchange rate in the Budget. The Treasurer may not know it, but this problem of a wildly fluctuating currency is absolutely critical to our farmers, our miners, our manufacturing exporters, our import competing industries and, as a result, to our economic stability. </PARA>
<PARA> Where in the Budget document does the Treasurer have anything to say about exchange rate movements? There is nothing in the index. There is virtually nothing in the Treasurer's long speech. However, in Statement 2, `The Budget and the Economy', in the section entitled `Structural changes, economic policy and economic performance' on page 2.53 there is, buried away, a footnote, number 16, in the section headed `Current Account'. The wording in the footnote suggests that the Treasurer wanted the information contained in it to be incapable of interpretation. Here for the record is what footnote 16 says:</PARA>
<PARA>For example, in an investment upsurge (such as that experienced in recent years), demand for savings pushes up real interest rates (assuming an unchanged monetary policy stance) and increased aggregate spending puts pressure on domestic prices. The Australian dollar tends to rise as foreign savings flow to Australia. The widening of the gap between domestic investment and saving increases the capital account surplus with the current account deficit also widening (as the decline in competitiveness shifts production away from net exports) to match the increased capital inflow. As noted, fluctuations in the terms of trade, foreign demand or relative costs (for example, via a wages break-out) can directly influence the size of the current account deficit; however, any such effects will only be sustained in so far as they alter domestic saving and investment behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>There it all is. It is hard to interpret, but this is what it means: current government policies will result in a reduced capital inflow. It means that a lower exchange rate will result from that reduced capital inflow. A lower exchange rate will improve our international competitiveness. A lower exchange rate will move resources out of imports and into exports and a lower exchange rate, according to footnote 16, is therefore crucial in the medium term to bring our overseas debt under control. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the Treasurer is saying to us. He may have put it all in code but nonetheless that is the message that the Budget footnote has given us. Since these magic words were written the exchange rate has not gone down. The exchange rate has gone up as it has been doing for some months. The market reality is that the Government's deliberate high interest rate policy and the perception that there will be a reasonably strong demand for our commodities in the near to medium term have pushed up the value of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Treasurer's policy settings which were established in the Budget and designed to bring the dollar down, it has risen. What an extraordinary dilemma the Treasurer now finds himself in. If he causes monetary policy to be eased significantly-and remember he has told us that he tells the Reserve Bank of Australia what to do-and interest rates come down, then the Australian dollar might well fall somewhat, but that would only rekindle domestic demand and imports would start to rise again. So the Treasurer will be right back where he was over a year ago. His sole reliance on monetary policy has left him in a situation where the dollar is likely to stay firm. He knows that a rise of one cent in the value of the Australian dollar means about $150m for our farming sector, more for the mining industries, and that export manufacturers will decide to stop producing here and become importers instead.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has consistently maintained that his deliberate high interest rate policy is designed to cut back our imports. Perhaps the Minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), would like to tell the House whether anybody in the Labor Party has ever had the cheek to raise with the Treasurer the possible effects that his high interest rate policy might have on the value of the currency. Does the Minister at the table know that $40 billion can be traded every day? Do the Minister and the Treasurer know that our Reserve Bank is not big enough to get into that game when the stakes are so high? It would appear that the Treasurer does not really understand how his policies affect the value of our dollar in a floating exchange rate environment. Perhaps we can ask Senator Walsh to tell him. </PARA>
<PARA> So the Treasurer's policies are resulting in a higher exchange rate, lost markets, cheaper imports, and a worsening current account deficit-unless we do what the Treasurer has been trying to do, and that is to drive the Australian economy into a one-way tunnel of doom. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is still going through a learning curve that is decimating the Australian economy. In his early days he tried Keynesian demand stimulation and that did not work. Then he tried to increase taxes and balance the Budget and that did not work. Then he tried to loosen monetary policy and stimulate growth with the savings of foreigners and that did not work. Now he is trying to use high interest rates to dampen demand, but that is driving the country into a recession. No doubt he will now try to learn about the exchange rate effects in a commodities trading society, but if history is any guide he will mess that up too. </PARA>
<PARA> In last year's Budget there were only one and a half pages on the exchange rate in a document of some hundreds of pages. This year there are just a few lines and a footnote written in language that is barely comprehensible. The clear fact is that the Government's current economic policy can achieve its limited objective only if it crushes the very life out of the country and if it crushes demand for everything, including household necessities, basic services and productive investment. </PARA>
<PARA> To underscore this even further, the failure of the Treasurer's policies were identified in the Melbourne Herald last Monday, 10 September. This is what the newspaper said:</PARA>
<PARA>A strong Australian dollar, supported by its perception as an energy currency, has become independent of the need for high interest rates to attract capital for the first time in years. </PARA>
<PARA>In its report last week Syntec Economic Services said,``Oil prices do not have to leap for the Australian dollar to be ensconced now as a kind of Middle East substitute currency. But in the process, it may leave import-replacement manufacturing without viability''. </PARA>
<PARA>The stronger dollar will permit interest rates to fall further than the slowing economy would justify by itself. </PARA>
<PARA>But it also seems the dollar will not revisit the mid-US 70c level again. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear that the Treasurer and the Government have their priorities wrong and must clearly think again about what their new priorities should be. Ironically enough, in a fashion that appears inconsistent with the rest of the document, the conclusion on page 2.55 of Budget Paper No. 1 gives some clues to those new priorities. Three quotations from that conclusion on page 2.55 might be relevant. They are, first:</PARA>
<PARA>...it is now more widely recognised that maintenance of real wage restraint and a healthy rate of return on capital are vital to both employment and investment prospects, and hence to output growth and living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence, much more of any growth in living standards in the 1990s will, as in earlier decades, need to come from improved productivity feeding in part into higher wages and in part into lower prices and thus lower inflation. Lifting the pace and broadening the focus of micro-economic reform will be crucial in this respect, as will a well-managed transition towards more flexible labour market arrangements, including enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the main challenges of the 1990s will be to reduce our inflation rate and inflationary expectations significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is quite incapable of delivering policies that will achieve the objectives set out in its own conclusion. How can the average Australian be comfortable with wage restraints with the current high level of interest rates?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Throsby will be able to have his say. I will ask him what he is going to say about unemployment and inflation and what he is going to do when the Bill comes to this Parliament on the part private financing of the Commonwealth Bank. With a restive work force and declining investment, where is the evidence to suggest that productivity can be improved when it has been unchanged for the last seven years? Why does the Government now think it can lower inflation when it has been locked in at 7 per cent for some years, a level twice as great on average as that of our major trading competitors? Where is the evidence of major changes in micro-economic reform when progress has been at a snail's pace at best? Finally, where is the evidence of a transition toward the coalition's policies of a more flexible labour market arrangement, including enterprise bargaining? The evidence is not there and unless the Government changes its priorities, the Budget will fail and the economy will sink further into the mire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The priorities should be those that have been clearly enunciated by the coalition in its policies: firstly, quickly reducing inflation to the level of our major trading competitors, a point made most forcibly and effectively by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) in his excellent maiden speech made in this chamber just half an hour or so ago; and secondly, cutting government expenditures. The Government has to cut further on government expenditures. Just prior to the last election the coalition in its Economic Action Plan detailed $3 billion worth of cuts in government expenditure. It is there to be cut if the Government will only grasp the nettle and have the courage and the political will to make the cuts, but it will not do that. It has not done it and it will not do it. It has not got the courage to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third priority is privatisation. This means the transfer of assets from the public sector to the enterprises' employees, and investors in the private sector. It does not mean this half-hearted business about 30 per cent financing. The fourth priority is contracting out; the fifth, taxing spending instead of taxing investment and savings; the sixth, ending by legislation present labour market monopolies and restrictive practices; and, finally, removing barriers to the growth of export industries. Only these priorities can allow Australia's economic difficulties to be resolved and only these priorities will restore Australia's place as one of the pre-eminent nations in our region of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). I would like to congratulate those new members to this place on their maiden speeches. I thought that the maiden speeches of honourable members on both sides of the House in this Thirty-sixth Parliament were particularly impressive. One need not always necessarily agree with everything that is said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose that one could call this section of the debate the Illawarra section. The previous Government speaker was my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). The Government speaker scheduled to speak after me is the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin). It is most unfortunate that the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) is leaving the chamber. I was about to say it is always a great pleasure to follow the comments of the honourable member for Bruce. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to what the honourable member said. Honourable members opposite rail at the Government and tell it what it should be doing. They never say, though, what they did during the 30 years they occupied the treasury bench. Of course, they got it right all the time. They always had it right. Their policies placed this country in a wonderful economic situation!</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bruce is a very nice chap. I remember when he was on the Opposition front bench. I frequently spoke after him in this place. A favourite target of his was the waterside workers, especially at Port Kembla. In fact, a couple of articles were published in the Australian describing what he would do to clean up the waterfront. On many, many occasions I have said to the honourable member for Bruce, `Come with me to Port Kembla. The next time a ship is held up in Port Kembla, you come there with me. We will talk to them and you can put your ideas to the workers at Port Kembla'. </PARA>

Today he tells us that we all have to be hairy chested and go out there and cut and slash. He repeated the Opposition nonsense about privatisation-`Let's go in there and privatise the lot'. The honourable member said that there were more opportunities to cut if only the Government had the courage to cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again in this chamber I offer an invitation, or a challenge, to the honourable member for Bruce. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) calls the next election, whenever that may be, I invite the honourable member to come with me to Port Kembla, to Wollongong, to Dapto, to Shellharbour and tell the people there, the pensioners, the workers, the teachers in the schools where the Opposition would make cuts, what it would do. Let us not have all this nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the challenge. I challenge the honourable member for Bruce to come to my electorate. I will be there. He could come with me. I will not be aggressive. I will set up a couple of public meetings and he can tell the workers that I represent about the policies of the Opposition, what funds the Opposition would cut. If the honourable member comes with me to speak to the pensioners of Dapto, 200, 300 or 400 people will be there. He could tell the pensioners about Opposition policies, the areas in which funds would be cut. </PARA>
<PARA> I issue that invitation here. I do not know when the next election will be. The honourable member need not bother to wait for the next election. He is always welcome there, but particularly in the run-up to an election. He can tell the people in my electorate how members of the Opposition are hairy chested and how the Government is composed of wimps. He can tell the pensioners and all these other people about the economic policies of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA> There is much in the Budget that I am very pleased to be associated with. The Budget, as I suppose is natural, covered a wide range of topics. Many of the previous speakers from this side of the House were complimentary. On the other side, I felt that some of the comments were unnecessarily carping. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear some of the comments in this debate. Honourable members usually select an area in which they have some particular expertise or some topic that they are interested in. I fall into that category myself. One of the areas that I am particularly interested in is adult literacy. I propose to devote part of my speech to International Literacy Year (ILY). </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members would be aware, the United Nations has declared 1990 to be International Literacy Year. The Hawke Labor Government has established a national consultative council to guide Australia's involvement in the year, and I have the honour to be a member of the council. I was particularly pleased during Question Time today to hear the comments of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to the effect that additional funds had been made available to the council to enable it to continue into the early part of next year to finish some of the work that has already been started. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation has assumed the role of lead organisation in the preparation leading up to International Literacy Year. The general conference of UNESCO passed the following resolution:</PARA>
<PARA>International Literacy Year will not consist of a set of isolated activities but will rather be a means serving essentially to stimulate greater public and government awareness and consciousness in furtherance of the objective of eradicating illiteracy by the year 2000-in the knowledge that literacy training is not simply teaching people to read and write, but teaching them to understand so that they can live their life to the full. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no small challenge to eradicate illiteracy by the year 2000. International Literacy Year is not only for one year. People say that international years come and go. They come, they flower briefly, and then disappear. In this case, however, UNESCO has called for a plan of action to achieve literacy for all by the year 2000. It is certainly true that to achieve literacy for all in Australia will take longer than this year. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many misconceptions about the term `literacy'. Literacy is not a clearly definable position or a negative accomplishment. It is a set of skills people have to varying degrees and the fact that they lack what society perceives as an acceptable level of literacy has nothing to do with their intelligence. People who cannot read or write are not dumb, but their greatest fear is that other people will label them as such when they discover that they cannot read or write. Consequently, they often build their lives around a disguise. </PARA>
<PARA> At the commencement of this international year many people in the community thought that when we talked about illiteracy in the community we were talking about children or people who came from a non-Australian or non-European background. There are many people who were born in Australia, who grew up in Australia and who went to school in Australia who, for one reason or another, are illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why adults cannot read or write well enough in English. Many of them have grown up in poverty. Some of them were ill during those important formative years. Some had sight or hearing problems. They may have lived in an isolated area, left school early, or come from a family where English was not spoken very much at home. What has emerged this year is that many people have lost this skill. They may not have had it to a great degree. They had this skill at school, but because they have not used it, and for other reasons, they have lost it after they have left school. No matter how good the excuse, that perceived stigma is the biggest hurdle a person faces when coming forward for help. </PARA>
<PARA> In some parts of the world literacy simply means being able to sign one's name.  Expectations vary in accordance with cultural demands on society. Before I came to this place I worked in the area of adult education. I was aware of the literacy problem in the community. It often seemed to me that where the problem came to the fore in the people I was dealing with is when their children would come home and ask their parents to help them with their homework. The parents could not do that and it was becoming an embarrassment to them. Often, after many, many attempts, they would pluck up the courage to come to the organisation that I worked with to see whether we could help them. They were embarrassed when their children asked for help with their homework and they had to admit to their children that they could neither read nor write.</PARA>
<PARA> UNESCO estimates that there are one billion adults worldwide who lack literacy skills, with 600 million of these living in our own Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, Australia's near neighbour, Papua New Guinea, has an illiteracy rate which exceeds 50 per cent. The giant Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of this Parliament at the moment is looking at relationships between Australia and Papua New Guinea. I hope the Committee will look at that problem too. I do not think we should go in there with a big brother attitude and try to put an Australian solution onto the illiteracy problem in Papua New Guinea. We must listen to what the people there say and work with them to help them overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now more than one million adults in Australia lack some sort of literacy skills considered adequate for our society. It is always difficult when we are talking about illiteracy. Does it mean that a person cannot read or write? The organisation has come up with the term `functional illiteracy'. This means people cannot read a simple sentence in English, cannot decipher telephone dialling instructions, cannot read classified newspaper advertisements or fill out simple application forms. </PARA>
<PARA> The goal of Australia during International Literacy Year is to achieve active literacy in the community. For an advanced technological society such as Australia, active literacy is defined as the sort of literacy which allows people to use the language to enhance their capacity to think, create and question. In this way they can participate more effectively in society. As politicians, we should also be aware that it is very necessary for people to be literate. We have compulsory voting in Australia, and I think it is very important for the political process that people be literate. </PARA>
<PARA> The social cost of low literacy skills is inestimable and will grow as society's increasing sophistication puts unprecedented demands on the general population. With computers taking over so much of our lives today, I used to be fond of saying that in a few years time those who were computer illiterate-which I think I am-will be as disadvantaged in society as those people in society today who are functionally illiterate. It is encouraging that children are introduced to computers in primary school because they are increasingly so much a part of our lives. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that a lack of English language skills could be costing Australia something like $3.2 billion a year in the additional communication time needed in the workplace. But that figure could be much higher if it took into account the increased cost of industrial safety, poor product quality, low job mobility and flexibility, high staff turnover and limited quality of life. It is interesting to note that the House of Representatives Committee on Employment, Education and Training has set up a subcommittee to look at literacy in the workplace. Already that subcommittee has received much valuable information and insight on the needs of the work force through submissions from people in the work force and by going around and looking at some of the problems that exist in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> We really must have a literate workplace if we are to have a literate population. Everyone is bandying words around about the clever society and things like that. Basically, if we are going to be a clever society we really must have a literate work force. The United Nations sees International Literacy Year as a way to stimulate a greater public and government awareness of its objective of eradicating illiteracy by the year 2,000. Remember, that is less than 10 years off and there is a lot to be done, but already much has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> An important part of Australia's agenda for International Literacy Year has been to make adult literacy classes freely available in a variety of settings to those who need them. That may be in people's homes, both in the suburbs and in the country, in the workplace and in educational institutions. The ILY program in Australia already has two themes: the pursuit of lifelong literacy learning and the notion that literacy development is a whole community responsibility. In terms of lifelong literacy, the existence of literacy programs for both children and adults reinforces the development of both groups. Conversely, neglect of adult literacy needs contributes to generational cycles of literacy difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Meeting the literacy demands of a contemporary society and economy will produce real benefits for the nation. The converse of that is that the costs of inadequate literacy are enormous. International Literacy Day was marked last Saturday by an announcement by the Federal Government of a $40m package of initiatives in extra literacy support. Literacy involves the integration of listening, speaking, reading, writing and critical thinking. It incorporates numeracy. It includes the cultural knowledge which enables a speaker, writer or reader to recognise and use language appropriate to different social situations. For an advanced technological society such as Australia our goal must be an active literacy which allows people to use the language to enhance our capacity to think, create and question, which helps them to become more aware of the world and empowers them to participate more effectively in society. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to congratulate and thank all those who are making special efforts to work for literacy development in Australia. The literacy task force of the Illawarra and South East Regional Council of Adult Education, headed by Fran Sanders, is conducting adult literacy programs throughout the Illawarra and south coast region of New South Wales. As the honourable member for Macarthur said, within that region there are 10 volunteer groups, each with 10 volunteers working in the community helping to meet the needs of people who are experiencing literacy problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own electorate of Throsby, Margaret McAllister, the literacy officer at the Shellharbour College of Technical and Further Education, produces an excellent newsletter-a copy of which I will send to the honourable member for Macarthur, if he has not already received it-which is proving to be a valuable resource for those 100 volunteers. In the Shoalhaven region, Ms Terry Eddy is planning an innovative workplace literacy program with Shoalhaven City Council. Mention here must also be made of Anne Krone, coordinator of the Illawarra and South East Regional Council of Adult Education, who has come to Eden-Monaro and has made a valuable contribution to literacy development in her region. </PARA>
<PARA> With the contributions of people such as Anne Krone, Terry Eddy, Fran Sanders and Margaret McAllister, the clever country will become a highly literate country, one in which we will all be articulate readers and writers and, above all, be critically intelligent users of language. For it is through language that we shape our experience, form our values, structure our community and give expression to our hopes and aspirations in a democratic society. After all, to be deprived of literacy is to be denied access to many of our fundamental human rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there is one aspect of this debate that concerns me. I keep hearing words such as `the clever country' and how we are going to become more articulate. This comment is not original; I gleaned it last week from my friend and colleague the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) when he was addressing a literacy meeting in Melbourne. The point he was making, which I think is worth sharing, is that when we talk about the lucky country and becoming the clever country and things like that, it is assumed that it was by some accident that we became the lucky country. We became the lucky country only because there were already a lot of skills in Australia. Certainly we have mineral resources and so on, but it took an amount of skill to extract those resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lalor was saying at this conference that we should be very careful about talking as though it were some freakish accident that we happen to be the lucky country. The lucky country involves a lot of skills. But we will not become the clever country unless we are the literate country. With the work we are doing and the great support the Government has given to the International Year of Literacy, we will most certainly become an increasingly literate society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Budget introduced a couple of weeks ago has been described as a Budget with lots of pain and little gain. That is a pretty true description. We still have the highest taxing Government that this country has ever known. Even though the Budget provides for a surplus of $8 billion, which is highly commendable of course, I think it should be pointed out that $6 billion of that surplus is coming directly out of the taxpayers' pockets because the total tax revenue in this Budget has been increased by $6 billion. So it is straight out of the taxpayers' pockets and purses-an increase in taxation of 6.4 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, of course, there are the cutbacks to the States and to local government. Local government will suffer a cutback of $25m in real terms for each of the next two years, and we are looking at a Budget which provides, plans and is designed for an additional 60,000 of our fellow Australians to be unemployed by the end of this financial year. But I will return to that question of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Budget, family allowances are going to be assets tested from next January and 98,000 Australian families will lose the family allowance; Austudy will be tightened; and, once again, pensioners have been thoroughly confused. Every time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brings down a Budget he changes the rules and confuses them. I happen to believe very strongly that elderly Australians have the right to relax in their later years and not be subjected to confusion, worry and stress. It seems to me that every time the Treasurer provides us with a Budget, he provides extra stress for elderly Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is stuck again at between 7 per cent and 8 per cent at the present time. The Treasurer forecasts that inflation in 1991 will be 6.5 per cent. With respect, I suggest he will be wrong again. He has been wrong every other time he has delivered a Budget since the Budget of 1983. The rate of inflation that we are suffering, compared with some of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, quite frankly is just a joke. The latest 1990 figures are Australia, 7.7 per cent; Austria, 3 per cent; Belgium, 3.1 per cent; Denmark, 2.4 per cent; West Germany, 2.3 per cent; Japan, 2.5 per cent; and the Netherlands, 2.2 per cent. Yet this is the world's greatest Treasurer with a Budget which is on track. I think most Australians now have become so cynical that every time the Treasurer tells us that his economic plans are working and are on track they have got to the point of having not a laugh behind their hands but a quiet little cry. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only on the Friday after the Budget that the Treasurer had a sudden rush of honesty to the head. In the election in March he told us that everything was right and on track. On the Tuesday night of the Budget he said again that everything was fine and hunky dory. But on the following Friday he said-with an uncharacteristic frankness and forthrightness-that Australia was indeed back on the Argentinean road. </PARA>
<PARA> One group in our society who must realise and know this, because they are suffering so much, are the farmers of this country. It has been said, and I will say it again and again, that the Australian farming community is the most efficient in the world. All I can say is: God help it if it were not, because the Australian primary producers, suffering under high interest rates and inflation and being devastated by economic conditions, would be in even greater trouble than they are now. This year there is a 48 per cent decrease in the terms of trade for our farmers. On top of that, in this Budget farmers will have to pay 100 per cent of all export inspection, domestic meat inspection and quarantine fees. At the present time they are paying only 60 per cent. With commodity prices down, there will be a further fall in net farm income. </PARA>
<PARA> Another feature of the Budget concerning our primary producers is that the actual amount contributed by the Government to agricultural, forestry and fishing industries is continuing to fall. In 1989-90 the Government contributed $445.4m. The budgeted figure for this financial year is $423.3m-down $20m-odd-and the projected figures for the next three years are $356.8m, $349m and $308.9m. The expenditure on our important agricultural, forestry and fishing industries is going down and down. While the Government will spend only $423.3m this year, the rural community will pay $1,369.9m in levies and charges. One cannot talk to me about subsidies for Australian primary producers; they are paying far more than they get. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government talks about increases in agricultural expenditure, but most of this $429.7m is the extra money collected from the increase from 8 per cent to 18 per cent in the tax paid by woolgrowers and another $21m in increased levies from the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. This treatment of Australian farmers is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I take this opportunity-because what is happening in the Persian Gulf is very important-to support the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Government and all of us in this Parliament who are determined that the iniquities of Saddam Hussein shall not be condoned and shall be stopped. When our ships were sent off it was announced that our sailors and other military personnel would get special pay. I have been handed a letter-I hasten to say not from somebody in my electorate, because I would hate the sailor to be harassed in any way-written by one of our sailors to his father. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Did you hear that we were to get $30 a day and $45 a day in the Gulf area and our pay was to be tax free. It has been 3 weeks since they made that promise and wouldn't you know it, that's as far as they have gone, the pay people keep asking Canberra and all they get is we will get back to you. The boys are getting a little cheesed at that, a lot of money-we could be earning interest on it. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is the case, if there has been some delay because of a failure in the bureaucracy, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister should take immediate steps to make sure that that situation is remedied. Those Australian men serving in those ships need and deserve the total support of every Australian, and this Parliament in particular. The question is: When will they know? I hope they will know very soon indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It will come as no surprise to members of this Parliament that, in speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, I would like to say a word or two about roads. Even though there has been some increase in the allocation for roads in this Budget, in the seven years since the Hawke Government came into office there has been a decrease of 27 per cent in real terms in the money provided for roads in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that it is indeed a shame, because the roads of Australia are the transport infrastructure. Unless adequate funding is provided, the condition of roads will go backwards at a great rate. Members of the National Party of Australia all know of bitumen roads that local government organisations are having to plough up, because they do not have sufficient funding to continue the maintenance. I know the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has occasionally taunted me and said, `You want all this money for the Pacific Highway, but you want to cut expenditure too. You can't have your cake and eat it as well'. I suggest one can, because the cake for roads is growing bigger all the time. The amount being collected in fuel levies is increasing. Even from the dreadful situation in the Gulf the windfall in fuel levies will be $100m or more. That should go immediately into a road funding program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must be fair to the Minister for Land Transport and say that I welcome the fact that in the next three years an additional $300m will be spent on the Pacific Highway to take it along the way towards becoming a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway. That must occur. That is not open to debate any more. It was some six years ago when I started campaigning for a new Pacific Highway. When I started, some people said, `Garry Nehl, you are a bit of a nut; that is pie in the sky and you will never get it'. I am not told that any more. Everyone in Australia agrees that the Pacific Highway must have special national priority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed I have, and I thank the shadow Minister for his comment. I welcome the additional funding, but should point out that of that $300m over the next three years, $130m will come from the Federal Government and $170m from the State Government of New South Wales. I take this opportunity to praise Nick Greiner, Wal Murray, the Minister for Roads, Mr Bruce Baird, and their team, for their recognition of the priorities for the Pacific Highway. It will and must be a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thank the Minister for Land Transport for finally accepting my invitation of a couple of years standing to come up and drive the length of the Pacific Highway from Hexham to the Queensland border. I see that my friend and colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) is present in the chamber. Recently he drove a few hundred kilometres of the highway. I say to the Minister that this issue will not go away until there is a new Pacific Highway. I am going to stick to the Minister like a flea on a dog until we get it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Pacific Highway is the major highway in Australia and carries the heaviest volume of traffic. It is significant to all Australians. I would not have the hide to stand here and say that we should spend $1 billion, $2 billion or whatever it takes to upgrade that highway just for my constituents or for the people of the north coast. The issue is much broader than that. The Pacific Highway serves the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I should briefly mention the fact that the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP) is being phased out. It is unfortunate that no consultation occurred with local government owners of local aerodromes before that decision was made. As an example, in my electorate the Kempsey Council this year has a subsidy of $27,000 under ALOP, but it still expects a loss of $25,000 and is looking to a loss of $41,000 in 1991. When the subsidy of $27,000 goes, that will be added to that loss. It is difficult to understand how the small airports will continue to be viable once the Government withdraws from that funding. I wonder how many other communities are in the same boat. Also, the `location specific charger' will be introduced. That is another piece of jargon for landing fees that will be phased in over the next 12 months for aerodromes still under ALOP. Of course, there has been no consultation, and I am most concerned for the future of those aerodromes. </PARA>
<PARA> On the broader scene, I make the strongest possible protest about the $200 landing and departure fees at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport in peak times. Those fees are designed to discourage smaller aircraft from landing and will have a disastrous impact on country airlines and commuter airlines. Country people will be vastly disadvantaged by that proposal. Country air services will decline. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AE4">Mr NEHL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ambulance services will be affected. More people will be compelled to travel by road, at a greater risk and cost to the nation. It is unfair that the same fee should apply whatever the size of the aircraft. For a nine-seater the fee will be $22 a head. If the aircraft has only five passengers-and that often happens-the fee will be $40 a head. These fees will put the smaller airlines out of business. Compare those fees with that which will apply to a 767 aircraft with 207 passengers, where the fee will be only $1 a head. Even if the aircraft were only half full, which is a rarity, the fee will be only $2 a head. The reason for the introduction of that charge is that there is no third runway at Mascot, and that is because this Government has been unable to grasp the nettle and do what had to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should speak also about the Commonwealth Bank and the fact that it will bail out the State Bank of Victoria by privatising 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank's capital base. The Treasurer has said that the 30 per cent will be funded by superannuation funds. On an Australian Broadcasting Corporation television program on the night of 28 August the Treasurer agreed that the dividend paid to the Government out of annual profits from the Commonwealth Bank was 22 per cent. The superannuation funds are controlled largely by insurance companies and the trade unions. This 30 per cent privatisation will be highly selective so that big business and the trade unions will be the ones to benefit from it. But what about the battler, what about the ordinary Australian, what about the Commonwealth Bank customers? Why can they not get a piece of the action and buy shares to participate in this 22 per cent profit?</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested already to the Treasurer by one of my constituents that the 30 per cent interest should be put on offer to every individual, every citizen, every corporation, every superannuation fund and any other legal entity in Australia. Why not have a scheme for all Australians? On the 7.30 Report tonight I heard the Prime Minister telling Paul Lyneham that the Government will privatise up to 49 per cent of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. How about a piece of that cake too for ordinary Australians? Or will that all go to the trade unions and the major companies as well?</PARA>
<PARA> During the week when the Budget was brought down I spoke in the grievance debate about the proposed closure of the Medicare agency at Macksville in the Nambucca Valley. As I said then, it is strange that the Medicare office will close when the Commonwealth Employment Service is expanding, and Social Security already has plans to put an office in there. I have had tremendous support from organisations and citizens throughout the Nambucca Valley in making representations to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). I spoke to him on the day that I contributed to the grievance debate. He has been very sympathetic and I am pleased to say that shortly prior to coming into the chamber tonight I received a letter from the Minister. In part he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commission has a responsibility to maintain a balance between the provision of Medicare offices throughout Australia and the containment of costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. He said also in the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>In the current economic climate the Commission, in common with all Government departments and agencies, is required to examine its operations against the available funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is fine. What has to be pointed out is that the State Manager of the Health Insurance Commission told me in no uncertain words that the people of the Nambucca Valley could rely on the usual prompt mail service and, as well, that they had to close that agency to find work for the workers in Sydney. I am not prepared at any time to accept blindly and quietly that people in my electorate should be sacked to keep people in jobs in Sydney. This fight will not go away. The Minister concluded his letter by writing:</PARA>
<PARA>However, I have asked the Commission to report to me on the circumstances surrounding the decision to close the Macksville agency. I expect a final decision towards the end of October. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the final decision will be a sane and sensible one. I conclude by making one point, and that is to convey to the Government through the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, the appreciation and thanks of the Surf Lifesaving Association for the continued financial support, in particular from the Macksville-Scotts Head Surf Life Saving Club, for the rubber duckie which was handed over at the presentation dinner last Saturday night. I say to all members of this Parliament that we must have samaritan conditions for surf lifesaving clubs. We are getting to the point where individual surf lifesavers and clubs are being sued, litigation will boom and the people doing this work on a voluntary basis have to be protected by samaritan indemnity. I appeal to the Government to give this matter strong consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before making some comments from this side of the House on our perspective on the Budget, I would like to endorse the last comments made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). He touches upon a very real problem concerning community service providers. This is indeed a problem in the surf lifesaving movement right around Australia which perhaps needs to be looked at, if not by this Government, then by State governments, to see whether there is a legal base for securing indemnity for people against some of the claims that might be made against them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my contribution tonight I want to touch on one or two issues that were raised by the Budget that has been brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I must take issue with those speakers from the other side of the House who have variously described this as being a dreadful Budget. Some have said that it has been too harsh; others have described it as not being tough enough-which, of course, is the position of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and others. The Budget clearly has a strategy which is designed to ensure that the present economic difficulties facing Australia are met head on. It is designed with a clear set of objectives in mind and it is designed to ride through what commentators are at present describing, quite rightly, as a particularly rough period for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the issues which some people seem to be glossing over very readily is the question of unemployment. We hear those honourable members on the other side bleating quite loudly and quite often, suggesting that the Budget estimates which say that unemployment is going to rise are understating the problem and that this is-shock, horror-terrible news. It is convenient that these people forget that in 1983 the unemployment rate in this country was in the double digit figure range-10.3 per cent-that it had been brought about by a `fight inflation first' strategy adopted by the former economic advisers and the former economic Ministers of the Fraser Government and that in the last 12 months of that Government we saw more than 500,000 fellow Australians thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap-as the Treasurer rightly reminds honourable members in this place on different occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy and very cynical to say that the same sorts of circumstances and the policies being pursued by this Government will lead us to that same conclusion. I think not, simply because the Government has a clear strategy in place which, because of our burgeoning overseas debt problem which has been essentially created by the private sector-and I think even those honourable members on the other side would agree that that is the case-is, in fact, being tackled properly by this Government. One only has to look at the direction in which the Government is proposing to move with regard to the way in which the surplus in prospect is to be utilised to see just how effective our strategy is in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes to the Budget Papers one can see that Commonwealth debt is, in fact, going down on a yearly basis because the Government chooses to pay it off. In this present debate about asset sales and what should be done with some companies which, at the present time, are under the control of this Government, we have heard suggestions that some of that money should be directed at paying off our overseas debt from the Commonwealth's perspective. That is a view to which I subscribe. This Government's debt has continued to decline progressively over the last few years. It may well suit those on the other side of this place to take a look at some of those figures before they start mouthing some of the platitudes, as they have previously, as to how this Government has caused that overseas debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue associated with unemployment was clearly explained in an article by Ross Gittins which appeared this week in the Sydney Morning Herald. In that article he said that probably one of the major achievements of the Treasurer was the real growth in jobs in Australia during the past seven years and the real decrease in the unemployment rate. It is, I suppose, strange times indeed when people on both sides of this place, economic commentators and those in the world of business look to unemployment statistics to give them some sort of guidance as to whether the level of domestic demand is being slowed. It really is a strange set of circumstances when people say, `Isn't it good, the unemployment rate has gone up? That must mean that the Government's policies are working' and we translate that to mean that interest rates will start to come down and the economy will stabilise. I believe that the Government, clearly, must keep a weather eye out for those unemployment trends. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area that I represent people suffered drastically as a result of the inactivity of the policymakers opposite in their last period of government and the economic recession that befell this country in the early 1980s almost devastated the Illawarra region. I think that I am the third speaker in succession from the Illawarra region to talk from this side of the House on the Budget measures. I know I speak on behalf of the others when I say that we will be working assiduously to ensure that the same sorts of problems that we faced in the early 1980s do not reappear. I feel confident enough to be able to say that that is indeed the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my real pleasure to be able to attend a breakfast in Wollongong a week after the Budget was delivered which was arranged by the Wollongong business community and to speak on behalf of the Government on what the Budget 1990-91 would mean for the Illawarra region. I was a member of a panel of people who represented Government and Opposition interests, the business community and other levels of government, and it was quite interesting to hear people from the chambers of commerce say that whilst the Budget did not contain measures specifically geared towards the Illawarra region, as had occurred in the past through such measures as the steel regions assistance program and so on, nevertheless it was generally felt that the area had steeled itself-for want of a better pun-to withstand any further attacks, in an economic sense, on our region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite interesting to see that, in the case of 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984, when the recession hit the steel industry for a number of reasons that have been well documented, the massive lay-offs that followed will not be repeated now. It does not necessarily matter if interest rates are at the level at which they are now in an endeavour to slow down domestic demand; the real effect in a region such as the Illawarra will not have anywhere near the disastrous consequences that it had in the past, simply because the work force in major industries in the region cannot be cut further economically. </PARA>
<PARA> I also indicate that in our area there has been considerable work at diversifying our economic base. The tourism industry is alive and well and the university is prospering and developing some outstanding programs in association with local industry. I am pleased to see the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table tonight, nod his head when I talk about that because he knows full well that the university and industry, working in partnership, have put forward a number of proposals under the cooperative research projects grants scheme that he administers. He also knows, from his visit to my electorate and to the university, how important those particular projects will be. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the revitalisation that is taking place in the Illawarra it is in telecommunications that we see one of the great advantages that can result. Telecom Australia has moved to the University of Wollongong and is carrying out extensive research work, particularly in the area of fibre optics. It is our view that, through a cooperative research centre project, that level of industrial development and new technology can make Wollongong and the Illawarra the centre for telecommunications throughout the whole of Australia. We believe that there is a real chance for us to advance in that area. We need funding to develop at campus east, which is an adjunct of the University of Wollongong, in order to house the new technology that wants to come to the Illawarra region. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been successful in attracting Nortel from northern Canada and, as I have said, we have also been successful in attracting Telecom from within Australia. There are many high-tech companies that would like to come to our region and, in the long term, help create further jobs and opportunities. Because of those activities and because of the work of my colleagues and myself in bringing to the attention of Ministers of this Government the specific needs of our region, we believe that by working in harmony at government level with the business community and with the ordinary working person within the Illawarra region, we have really developed an economy which is a lot stronger and able to withstand some of the other domestic problems confronting other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now take the opportunity to refute a couple of the furphies raised by the Opposition on some of the measures contained in the Budget. The honourable member for Cowper described the Budget as being terribly tough. The honourable member claimed that every time the Treasurer brings down a Budget it affects the aged in Australia and that the pensioners get hit. Let me remind the honourable member that the only thing the Government has done to the aged in the community-until the Budget imposed a $2.50 charge for prescriptions-is ask them to delay receipt of indexed pensions for six weeks on two occasions. That was subsequently also withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, the Government has been dreadful to those pensioners by increasing their pension level to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The Government fully indexed those pensions in line with the consumer price index, and the Government does that automatically three times a year. The Government is also doing dreadful things such as taking aged pensioners out of the tax net so that by 1995 no pensioner in receipt of a social security benefit will pay tax. These are the sorts of dreadful things that this Government is doing to Australian pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, the Government has done further terrible things by giving an 8.4 per cent real increase to pensioners in the seven years the Labor Party has been in government. Compare that to a miserable decrease of 2.8 per cent in the seven years under the former Liberal-National Party Government in this country. The Government has also done some terrible things as far as the provision of aged care services are concerned. The Government has done terrible things by providing approximately $337.8m for aged persons homes, $27.3m for hostels for the aged and $195.5m for the home and community care program. Those are all the terrible things the Government has done in looking after the aged and the infirm in the community. This is what the dreadful Labor Government has done: it really has no compassion and does not care for the poor battlers in the community, whom we have done nothing for. What absolute rubbish! The quicker those sorts of furphies that are raised by honourable members opposite are shot down, the better it will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also makes one or two very important commitments as far as the Australian Customs Service is concerned. I should like to touch quickly upon a couple of those commitments. As honourable members would be aware, at present the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is inquiring into the Australian Customs Service. I am a member of that Committee and it should be noted that as the Committee has travelled around Australia and spoken to members of the Customs Service, it has observed a great need for the continued work of that Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to note in the chamber two honourable members opposite who are on that Committee. The Committee has noted the different needs of the Service that have arisen in different parts of Australia to effectively allow it to undertake the work it does on its own behalf and on behalf of a variety of agencies such as the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to note that provision has been made in the Budget for an upgrade on much needed computer equipment to enable the Australian Customs Service at airports and other locations to put in place its pass and tracking systems to keep tabs on people entering and leaving Australia so that people who are on wanted lists or those persons who are trafficking in narcotics, and undesirables of course, are clearly identified. Approximately $18.3m has been made available for that service. Approximately $3m has also been made available for a barrier enforcement strategy, which is clearly needed. I commend the Customs Service for its initiative in installing this type of equipment, especially the latest equipment which was installed at the recently opened international terminal at the Cairns Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other areas in which the Budget provides increased funding. Again, this refutes the argument that the Government lacks compassion and, as a Labor Government, does not fairly represent those people whom it is supposed to represent. Let me cite the allocation to the disabled. Something of the order of $3.4 billion is being provided by the Government for disability services. That is a sizeable allocation. However, honourable members who spoke earlier claimed that the increased funding for disabled persons, pensioners and others on social security benefits was too much. Those honourable members also claimed the Government has been too generous. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the honourable member for Cowper bleated that the Government had done terrible things such as tightening up on the family allowance, Austudy and unemployment benefits. Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways: either they want to see some real cuts made and moneys directed to those who are most in need-that is, cut out the middle class welfare-or they do not. They should make up their minds when they start getting involved in looking at the Budget Papers in a little more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the Budget Papers to deal with an area that is near and dear to my heart, and that is sport. I and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson), and other honourable members, were responsible in no small measure for ensuring that the Government commitment to funding for sport in Australia increased massively as a result of an inquiry that we undertook during the life of the last Parliament. It is pleasing to say that there is an allocation in the Budget of approximately $75m for sport. </PARA>
<PARA> That allocation covers programs in which every day people will have the opportunity to participate in health and fitness programs. The philosophy behind it is that if people are encouraged by either role models or by other activities to undertake a more healthy lifestyle, at the end of the day whichever government is in power, it will cut the social cost of having to provide medication, hospital care, health benefits and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has adopted an approach that earlier governments should have adopted, and that is one of prevention. For example, $3m has been committed to the international swimming championships to be held in Perth next year. The improvements to the facilities for those championships will be most welcome. Generally the outlay for all sports programs has been increased, in real terms, by 28 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the other programs which the increase in sport touches upon are things like elite athlete assistance, sports science, sports medicine, applied sports research and community programs. Of course, there is an allocation of $6m to pick up some of the community sport and recreation programs which were announced last year and which have to be covered in this Budget. Funding has also been increased for the Australian Sports Drug Agency. I am sure all honourable members would certainly applaud what has been done to weed out those people in sport who would bring it into disrepute by using performance-enhancing drugs. In that respect, we all pay a great deal of tribute to the former Senator John Black for the work he did with the Senate inquiry in that area. National sporting organisations and community sports groups are also receiving funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an appropriate way for the Government to develop across-the-board support for sport. However, if I do have a criticism of the Budget allocation for sport it is not that it is not enough but that there is no national facility sports program in place. While people would recognise that the spending of $190m on the Olympic Games bid is appropriate, naturally, the people in the capital city of Melbourne will be the ones to benefit. That is great but in regional centres such as Wollongong, Geelong or regional centres like the Hunter--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I stand here as the new member for Moore I find it difficult to convey the feelings of honour and intense pride this moment has aroused in me. I am, I believe, the first former police officer to be elected as a coalition member to the Parliament. I follow in the footsteps of two earlier policemen who have made their mark in this chamber, Dr Jim Cairns and His Excellency the Governor-General, the Hon. Bill Hayden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I had the opportunity to meet His Excellency and inform him personally of this fact. He remarked to me that on his appointment to the office of Governor-General, the Queensland Police Union wrote to him and said, `Well done, Bill. As a former Queensland police officer, you've gone the furthest yet.' Presumably members of the Queensland Police Union have some loftier position in mind for their former colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not be standing here addressing this House were it not for the efforts of those who worked tirelessly on my behalf in my campaign in March and who continue to assist me. I therefore take this opportunity in this, the greatest of Australian public forums, to thank them all once again. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make special mention of the great assistance provided to me by my State Liberal parliamentary colleague, the Hon. Reg Davies, MLC, whose advice, encouragement and organisational feats formed the essential components of the campaign's success. Reg has always been a great friend and supporter. He has stood by me through good times and bad. Never during those tumultuous years has his support or his friendship wavered. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes one takes the most ardent supporters for granted, all too often unthinkingly relying on their continuous backing as a matter of course. To my wife Geraldine and sons James and Phillip, who are back in Perth and who have long put up with the tension, absences and financial constraints that go hand in hand with modern political campaigns, I thank you dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that campaign would not have been the success that it was had it not been for the faith the people of Moore placed in me. Ultimately it is to them that I owe the greatest thanks for allowing me to stand here as their representative and address this chamber. I intend to repay the compliments they have shown in me by working hard on their behalf and by providing a strong voice for them in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to speak a little about the man after whom my electorate is named, George Fletcher Moore. I find in his character the quality of unselfish devotion to public duty, a quality that I intend to emulate as the representative of the electorate that bears his name. </PARA>
<PARA> Moore arrived in Fremantle in 1830 after a gruelling voyage from Ireland. Initially he sought an official legal position within the fledgling colony but, having been unsuccessful in obtaining such a position through the Colonial Office in London, he decided to sponsor his own journey to Western Australia. While farming eventually displaced his legal interests, Moore was a man of boundless energy who always took a keen interest in the colony's progress. He found an outlet for this energy in exploration and it was due to his efforts that desperately needed grazing land in the York and Northam districts was opened up to land hungry colonists. </PARA>
<PARA> He also utilised his legal skills in the service of the colony of Western Australia as the first Commissioner of the Civil Court, as Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and ultimately as Advocate-General. By virtue of his office, he became an early member of the Legislative and Executive Councils and did very useful work as a parliamentary draftsman. Although he also had the right to engage in private practice and reap the attendant financial rewards, there is no record of his having done so. Such was the spirit of the man whose name is carried by my electorate, such was the spirit of the man whose example I hope to emulate as the new member for Moore. </PARA>
<PARA> I am, however, no stranger to such concepts of public duty. At an early age my father, Terry Filing, a group captain in the Royal Australian Air Force, instilled in me the importance of placing duty before one's personal well-being. In fact, my most cherished memory is of me as a child accompanying my parents and brother to Buckingham Palace in 1965. There Her Majesty the Queen invested my father with the Air Force Cross for his exceptional leadership, airmanship and courage exhibited during an incident in which he safely landed the Handley Page Victor he was flying after losing three of the four engines. He is present this evening, along with my mother, who has demonstrated her own quiet courage and determination during a 10-year struggle with serious illness. </PARA>
<PARA> The notions of public service impressed on me by my father were further enhanced during my years with the Western Australian Police Force. From my days of walking the beat as a young constable to my time in the company fraud squad, my work made me acutely aware of my duty to society and of the need to make it a better and safer place in which to live. At the WA police academy there is a notice to which the attention of all new recruits is drawn. It simply says, `Cultivate a thick hide; you'll need it.'</PARA>
<PARA> May I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of my former colleagues in the Western Australian Police Force. I am proud to serve alongside men and women who selflessly assist the community with little thanks or recognition and with pay and conditions that do not reflect the sacrifices they are required to make daily in the pursuit of this duty. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, we, the elected representatives of the people, must devote ourselves to similar concepts of public duty, for it is this duty that forms the very bedrock upon which our Westminster system of government is built. I believe it was Edmund Burke who provided the most comprehensive definition of the Westminster model of parliamentary representation in his address to the electors of Bristol. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, gentleman, it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents . . . But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living . . . Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents and advocates; but Parliament is a deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the whole . . . You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not the member of Bristol, but a member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore have a duty to the people of our electorates, a duty to support and protect their rights and interests, a duty to legislate wisely on their behalf, a duty to ensure that the Executive does not abuse its power or exercise it arbitrarily, to protect our system of democracy. Should we forget that duty we shall forfeit our right to be here. The will of the people of our electorates will have it so. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, as the findings published in the recently released McCusker report demonstrate, despite that report's extraordinarily narrow terms of reference, the Labor Government of Western Australia abandoned this duty to pursue short term financial gain, losing in the process hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government of Western Australia was elected by the people of that State to administer them with honesty and integrity. The people of Western Australia paid their taxes in the belief that these funds would be wisely spent and the benefits of that expenditure would accrue to them in the form of a stable administration and better services. </PARA>
<PARA> Just how were these taxes spent? The McCusker report illustrates a government bedazzled by its high-flying entrepreneur mates, seducing them with tacky and shoddy get-rich-quick schemes. In the Rothwells fiasco alone, the Government lost something in the order of $300m of public moneys through repeated rescue attempts of a company that was apparently being bled dry by its chief executive. The Rothwells collapse represents a mere episode in the long and sordid saga that is WA Inc.. In all, the Western Australian Government squandered something in the order of $700m of taxpayers' money in worthless big business dealings. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that for some in this chamber the affairs of Western Australia may appear to be of limited relevance. I would, however, stress the contrary. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) referred to the standard of behaviour of some individuals in Australia's corporate sector having fallen short of what should be expected by the general community. The honourable gentleman talked of his Government's ensuring the regulation of corporate activity in the interests of ordinary shareholders and investors, and yet the business dealings of his Labor counterparts in the Western Australian Government, roundly condemned as irresponsible and often camouflaged to the shareholders-that is, the people-behind the excuse of commercial confidentiality, has escaped his criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions that shaped WA Inc. not only bore the hallmarks of administrative ineptitude and financial incompetence but also represented a rancorous betrayal by members of the Government of the people of Western Australia, who had entrusted to them the right to govern, and a betrayal of our system of democracy under which they were bound by duty to provide fair and honest government. </PARA>
<PARA> The deception and corruption that the entrepreneurs' money cultivated in the Government of Western Australia is of particular interest to me for I too was a victim. Before the Federal election of 1987 I was required to resign from the Western Australian Police Force to contest the seat of Cowan. Shortly before this my colleagues in the company fraud squad arrested and charged the then Chairman of the State Superannuation Board, Mr Len Brush, on charges of public corruption and forgery. Mr Brush, who held several key government posts and whose wife was the Premier's personal assistant, was alleged to have accepted a $150,000 loan from Perth businessman Robert Martin on condition that he would use his influence on the State Superannuation Board in Martin's favour. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Mr Brush was ultimately acquitted of all charges, the affair was not forgotten. Having been unsuccessful in winning the seat of Cowan, I contacted the Commissioner of Police seeking reappointment to my old position. I was informed that I would be required to go through the standard selection procedures, that there would be a one-year waiting list and that I would be required to resume at the rank of the most junior member of the force. Hence I lost my rank, my long service leave entitlements and my superannuation simply because I dared to participate in the democratic process. For whatever reasons the powers that be in Western Australia decided to punish me for seeking office, it represented an insidious and unforgivable attack on our system of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Democracy by its very nature is dependent upon the participation of the people. It may be cliched; however, nothing defines that concept of democracy better than the axiom: `Government of the people, for the people, and by the people'. As our system of democracy is all about the people, I would like to take this opportunity to describe the electorate and the people I represent in this House, for they are foremost in my mind as I stand here as their representative addressing this chamber for the first time on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> The division of Moore lies framed by the Liberal-held seats of O'Connor in the north and Pearce to the east in the northern suburbs of metropolitan Perth. To the south it borders upon the Labor-held seats of Cowan and Stirling, which were until the last election considered safe for that Party. To the west the Indian Ocean washes up on to sun-bleached beaches which have largely survived unblighted the refuse of urban expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> Encapsulated within Moore is the modern Australian predicament. The electorate is mostly situated in one of the fastest growing municipalities in Australia, the city of Wanneroo, with a population of 150,000. The city of Wanneroo forms a major growth area within the State, its suburbs forever reaching further north as new parcels of land are opened up for development to cater for those who seek to realise the greatest of Australian dreams, the establishment of a home of their own. From the crisp white sands that line the Indian Ocean in the west, a sea of tiled roofs and bricks punctuated by television aerials and power lines extend inland to the Darling Ranges. Grey tongues of bitumen probe vast sand-blown blocks of land that stand empty, expectantly awaiting new arrivals. Within months hopeful young families will begin cementing their dreams upon this land in bricks and mortar. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who have imprinted their hopes and aspirations upon these raw tracks of sandy ground come from all sections of society. They are market gardeners, cray fishermen, public servants and small businessmen; they are white collar workers and blue collar workers. Indeed, I too am one of these people. This is suburbia. This is the distinctive Australian landscape so aptly defined by that great Western Australian, Sir Walter Murdoch, when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Your suburban villa, and even your Shakespeare Society, are just as much parts of the real Australia as Chamber's Pillar; more's the pity, perhaps, but the fact is so. The cities we have built may be plagiarisms but they are as real as the vast sunburnt land on whose outer edge we have chosen to build them.</PARA>
<PARA>If we look into the minds of those who live in the electorate of Moore we may gain a lucid and accurate insight into the mind of middle Australia at present. In the last election the sitting member for Moore, Mr Allen Blanchard, experienced a swing against him of 18 per cent in the primary count. This was not because Allen Blanchard was a bad member; indeed, in the adjoining seats of Stirling and Cowan there were swings against Labor of 11 and 14 per cent respectively. I believe that we may quite safely draw the conclusion from the response of the people of Moore at the last election that they were sending a short and sharp message to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian heartland an anguished cry arose and permeated the national tally room: `Enough is enough'. The people of Moore said that they resented having to bear the brunt of the Government's economic incompetence, which relies so heavily on high domestic interest rates to reduce consumer demand. The first-time home buyers of Moore were saying that they did not want to be financially beholden to the banks for the rest of their working lives simply because they could not keep up with the extortionate monthly repayments. The small business people of Moore were saying that they did not want to see businesses that they had devoted their whole lives to building up, injecting every ounce of available capital into them in an effort to make them secure, fall into the hands of liquidators as a direct result of a government sponsored recession. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the concerns and fears of the voters of Moore. These are the harsh realities that daily descend upon the lives of average families throughout Australia. These are the truths of our so-called economic recovery, where families are forced to have two breadwinners to ensure that the weekly bills are met, where young Australians are delaying or even putting off having children because of the constraints of seven years of Labor financial mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Moore have demanded change. That is why I stand here as their new conservative member of parliament. Many of the honourable members who sit opposite me in this chamber may find the terms `change' and `conservative' incongruous. However, the realities of modern Australian politics have rendered them synonymous. Indeed, in the past, in the minds of some commentators on the Australian political system, the Labor Party has assumed the mantle of the party of initiative while the conservative parties are dismissed as merely the parties of resistance. That strikes me as being laughingly obsolete as I stand here in this, the Thirty-sixth Australian Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing demonstrates the converse better than the recent Budget. Undoubtedly it will go down in history as the great cop-out Budget. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) seems either to have lost his nerve or to have sacrificed economic sanity on the altar of personal ambition. What has happened to the wide ranging micro-economic reform promised by the Government during this session of Parliament? I feel a remarkable sense of deja vu as I see the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Deputy, like their predecessors Arthur Calwell and Gough Whitlam, awaiting the decision of the 36 faceless men before daring to implement Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is the Party of initiative. I see before me a government that has been in power for too long, a government that is bereft of ideas and direction. That is a government that the people of my electorate demonstrated in the last election had betrayed them. That is the sort of government Australia cannot afford in the current economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel immensely privileged to have entered this Parliament as part of the most talented political team Australia has seen. These faces that occupy the benches around me are the future of this country. We all share an old philosophy that now stands triumphant above the citadels of collectivist thought. We are the exponents of the philosophy that represents the future. We believe that freedom, both economic and political, is indivisible, that the economy ought to be left to regulate itself through the invisible hand of market forces with governments making and enforcing the rules of fair play. The States should not be a fairy godmother magically appearing at the maternity hospital, then, arm in arm, travelling alongside us on life's journey, whispering soothingly into our ears before finally standing as a silent mourner at the graveside. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet over the last century government has extended its tentacles into most facets of everyday life, conforming to a Fabian timetable of state ownership. We as conservatives stand committed to rolling back the intolerable precedent of government interference that has permeated every aspect of day to day life. Yet despite the most overwhelming rejection of collectivism by its former victims in eastern Europe, here in Australia we have a government that still quibbles over an increasingly irrelevant and outmoded party platform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now only too clear that the reforms necessary to extricate our country from this economic malaise will only come following the election of the coalition in 1993 or earlier. I am therefore proud to call myself a Liberal in times like these, I am proud to be able to expound the philosophy of the future, and I am proud to be a member of the team that almost certainly shall form the next government of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on his maiden speech. If he earns the respect from both sides of the House that his predecessor enjoyed he will be doing very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise a few items relating to the Budget. In particular, I was impressed by some of the remarks of the honourable member for Moore in relation to the reaction of his constituents. It is ironic that the honourable member for Moore can make a maiden speech deploring the impact of this Government's action when in response to the Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) got up and said, `You really haven't done the hard work. We really need to cut $3,000m more out of Federal Government expenditure'. </PARA>
<PARA> What that means for the electorate of Chifley is prospective cuts for my six pensioner clubs, affecting the senior citizens that go along to them. Perhaps we would not be getting the child-care centres that I am so proud of and will speak on later. Perhaps people would not be enjoying Austudy and have that encouragement. At least $1 billion of savings can be made there if, as the Opposition believes, Government expenditure needs to be cut by $3,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Opposition not only believes that we ought to be cutting back Federal expenditure by 3,000m, bearing in mind that it is the smallest it has been for some time expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, but it also now believes that we ought to introduce a consumption tax. When my electors go to the supermarkets and fork out their money-to be frank, they often complain about the increasing prices they face at supermarkets-they will get a once-off hit of 15 per cent on every item that they purchase. This will follow through to every aspect of their lives, and this will be particularly noticeable for those who currently do not enjoy any government assistance. For example, when they go to have a haircut they will find that haircuts are 15 per cent more. Petrol is already heavily taxed. We hear Opposition speakers time after time complaining about the amount of excise on petrol tax, but under them petrol will cost 15 per cent more. </PARA>
<PARA> We on the Government side very much reject the notion of imposing a consumption tax. The thing that fascinates me most is that the Opposition is going to do away with industry policy. There will be no tariffs and no measures of assistance to industry. There will be no government intervention in an attempt to get strategic industries going. But this should come as no surprise to manufacturers and it should come as no surprise to small business because the Opposition is always changing its industry policy. Every time it has a change of shadow Minister it trundles out a new industry policy. At least up front, nice and early, it is mentioning that it will not have an industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a particular vested interest in raising child-care at this time. I am very proud of the Government's record in child-care. Since 1983 the Hawke Government has increased the number of child-care places from 46,000 to 114,000. Expenditure on the children's services program has increased from $62m in 1982-83 to an estimated $232m this year. In the 1988-89 Budget the Treasurer announced a new national child-care strategy to provide a further 30,000 places over four years. The national strategy includes 20,000 outside school hours places, 4,000 centre based places, 4,000 family day care places and 2,000 occasional care places. Up to 1,000 of the 4,000 centre based places will be available for the industry program under which costs will be shared between employers and the Commonwealth employees using the centres. An estimated 8,240 of the new places under the national strategy will be available by the end of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in the electorate of Chifley, I am very proud to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have 813 long day care places, 88 occasional care places, 350 family day care places and 1,548 outside school hours places, making a total of 2,799 places. I am sure you will not be surprised to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Chifley is targeted as an area of high need. Whilst this Government may share a vision for wanting to provide the men and women, the families of Australia, with more child-care places, I am sad to report that that vision is certainly not shared by Blacktown City Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain that. In 1987 at Bowman Hall, the main hall owned by Blacktown Council, the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre held a seminar entitled `Where to in the 1990s?'. Over 500 people attended that seminar, and I was one of them. Blacktown City Council, being the host council, was invited to send its representatives but not one turned up. But more importantly, arising out of that seminar, arising out of having 500 people together trying to look at what was needed in the 1990s, a number of clear things came out. There was one very identifiable need-the need for a child-care centre that specifically catered for the needs of those migrants for whom English is a second language. </PARA>
<PARA> In Blacktown we have a very large migrant population. The largest group would be the Maltese. We have lots of Yugoslavs, Germans and Poles. There are lots of Filipinos. There is a very good mixture. We have Afghans and people from Mauritius. People from all over the world come to Blacktown. I have said many a time that I am very pleased to receive them. Arising out of this seminar was this proposal for a child-care centre. It would be not just to service Blacktown; it would be a focus for migrant people not only in Blacktown but regionally as well. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 April 1990, after having discussed the matter with the town clerk, I sent him a letter saying that I strongly supported this proposal. I pointed out the advantages of this proposal to the council and the people of Blacktown. I asked him, since I was fairly confident that we would get Federal Government funding because the relevant department was represented on the committee, as was the relevant State department, whether the council could provide a block of land so that we could construct this child-care centre. Last Wednesday night at council the report went to open council. Surprise, surprise, in that Liberal controlled, so-called independent council what was the result? They said no to this child-care centre. But they said no because they believed that it would lead to segregation. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell honourable members of the complete hypocrisy of the Liberal alderman, Alan Green. He and I were together on Saturday. I spoke first at Carnivale, where I said how strongly I supported this Government's multicultural policies and multicultural approach; that I was not threatened by the differences of different people coming to settle in Blacktown and I recognised that they contributed a unique quality to Blacktown that enriched us. I was not threatened, and I said that it was a challenge to make sure that no-one else was threatened. </PARA>
<PARA> Alderman Alan Green followed and said, `I endorse all of the remarks of Mr Price and on behalf of council I open Carnivale'. His saying that he supports multiculturalism is a lie and a damned lie. Following that, on the Wednesday night he said, `We can't have this child-care centre because it would lead to segregation'. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening here is that we have a racist council. When overseas dignitaries like the Prime Minister of Malta visit the council area, council members get up and say, `We value the contribution of the Maltese community, we support a multicultural society'. They are hypocrites and racist because every time they have to put their hands in their pockets, admittedly only to provide the land, they want to reject the idea. It is unnecessary and it leads to segregation. It is just poppycock. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there is an advantage in having a child-care centre where the children are from families who have English as a second language. I am never afraid of multiculturalism or of different groups saying that they want to preserve their cultures. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your electorate as in mine, over time people become very much Australian. They very much mix into society, and they bring with them some values that we often pick up and incorporate into our broader society. But they are not a threat to us. In terms of settling down into a city area, these ethnic groups need assistance. They have special needs. Report after report demonstrates that. That is not good enough for Blacktown Council. It says, `No, we don't want it. We believe in multiculturalism but we want the freedom to practise a racist policy whenever we like'. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Alderman Alan Green speaks with authority as an acolyte of his local State member. I do not know whether the State member shares that view; I hope not. Certainly she has never given me any indication that that would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the situation? Where does that leave us? For my part I am always happy to see facilities being provided for the City of Blacktown, but I know that the Labor council in Penrith will be absolutely delighted to pick up this project. I have spoken to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who loves getting new facilities for his electorate, and he is as keen as mustard to pick it up. So another facility that could have been a very good focus for our migrant community in Blacktown will go to another area. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to raise the broader issue of the way in which council runs its child-care centres. We have quite a number of council run child-care centres. There is not one parent body at any of those centres. The parents cannot claim ownership, they cannot have an input into the way in which the centres are run and they are not even allowed to undertake voluntary fund raising. In fact, it is very much an autocratic operation, made more autocratic by this independent, so-called Liberal-controlled Council. It has made it a lot worse.</PARA>
<PARA> That is not all. The centres have enormous trouble holding staff because of the inadequate support given by Blacktown City Council, and the dictatorial way in which they are run by the Council's Campbell Street head office. The Council pays, in comparison with Penrith and surrounding councils, very poor wages. So we have this constant staff turnover. I speak up on the main issue: the citizens of Blacktown, in federally funded council child-care centres, ought to be able to have a say. There ought to be a local management committee at every centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I will be raising with the Minister at the earliest opportunity this issue of Blacktown City Council rejecting this application which is supported by the Federal and State departments. I will be raising with the Minister that federally funded child-care centres in the City of Blacktown do not accord with good management principles, and are not allowing the citizens and parents of Blacktown to exercise their rights. I regret to say that inevitably I will be forced to approach the Penrith Council or Parramatta Council to ensure that this facility, a concept born out of a seminar in Blacktown that the Council refused to hold, is not lost to the western suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say that it is rather tragic that the Blacktown Council rejected an offer by the Federal Government to build a child-care centre and instead chose to use section 94 contributions to build a child-care centre in Minchinbury. It did not consult with the Federal Government, and we have a real funding problem there. I was working, I thought with reasonable success, through the Minister's office and the Department to get funding for that. No doubt the outrageous activities that occurred at the council meeting last night, bringing disrepute not only to the Council but tragically to the people of Blacktown, have undermined any prospect for success that I might have had. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some other matters that I wanted to raise. I am pleased to report to the House that we had a very successful visit by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, from our policy speech that Federal money was being provided for outer metropolitan urban centres to improve public infrastructure. I was able to inspect, with the cooperation of my good friends and colleagues the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) and the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), the bus terminal at St Mary's, the one at Mount Druitt and also the one at Blacktown. Whilst it is the State Government that sets the priority for new bus terminals, I certainly hope that they will rate highly on the list presented by the State Government. It is certainly true to say that, if the State Minister is not aware of the circumstances of these depots, certainly the Federal Minister is. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wanted to raise very quickly a couple of other issues, but I will not have time to do so. In particular, the honourable member for Moore in his maiden speech worried about whether the Government was going to deliver micro-economic reform. The thing that really amuses us on this side of the House is that the Opposition, in its 30 years in government, had every opportunity to introduce all the things that it believed in. Today we were reminded yet again by the Treasurer in relation to the two-airline policy that the Opposition, when faced with the opportunity to remove that and institute micro-economic reform, of course fumbled the ball. Not only did it extend it, but it entrenched it and required at least 12 months notice of the abolition of the agreement. Indeed, this Government wanted to move earlier but was not able to. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at any of the other major issues, such as the upgrading of our railways and reform of the waterfront, one sees that it is this Government that has taken the initiative and is getting stuck into the hard issues. Notwithstanding the rhetoric that comes from the other side of the House, it is this Government that is leading the way, in cooperation with the employers and the trade unions, to provide real micro-economic reform on the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I place on record that prior to the last election I was very much in favour of an inquiry into the banks. I opposed the appointment of an independent banking ombudsman and believed there should be a public banking ombudsman. It is a fact that that inquiry did not go ahead. But given some of the disclosures since the last election, particularly the lending policies of the banks and the way in which the banks are now starting to foreclose on small business, if ever there were a time for a full public inquiry by an ad hoc standing committee of this Parliament into the banks, I believe now is the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, before I speak specifically to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I want to pay tribute to the fine maiden speech made by my colleague from Western Australia, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). At the same time, I would like to pay tribute to each of those honourable members who, since this Parliament commenced, have made maiden speeches. Each has made a particular contribution. Without exception, the speeches have shown various degrees of merit, which shows promise for the contribution those honourable members will be able to make in the years ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would enjoin those honourable members on the other side of the House who have made their maiden speeches to remember that executive government will ride over them unless they exercise their rights. I ask those honourable members to try to develop a respect for the parliamentary process, which is in danger of being lost as a result of the trend towards executive imperialism which is evident in this Parliament. That will be a matter for them to decide in the fullness of time. I do not want to preach to them and I am sure they will not let me do so very often. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been few episodes more despicable in the recent history of Australian politics-and I use the word `despicable' advisedly, knowing that it is one that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) likes to use; he has that in common with Sylvester the cat, but Sylvester delivers it with more conviction and class than the Prime Minister-than the Government's bout of post-election honesty about the state of the economy. In the weeks following the campaign, senior Labor Ministers and former members of the Government let slip that they had deliberately engineered a recession as the cornerstone of economic policy. The first indicators of that recession were in evidence during the election campaign, but it was only after the election that the true extent of the current economic downturn was admitted by some Ministers and a former senior Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It was without the benefit of this information that the electorate narrowly returned the Government. How much different the decision of the people of Australia could have been had they known of the economic hardship that was about to be thrust upon them by a government devoid of policy solutions for this country's economic problems. Faced with record current account deficits and a mounting foreign debt, the Government resorted to the only strategy it is capable of-a deepening recession in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Recession is the best, the absolute best, solution this Government can find to restore external and internal balance to the economy. The Government seeks to choke off demand for imports by flattening the economy and succeeds instead in throttling all demand. It goes without saying that this is no solution to our current account and external debt problems. Nor is it a substitute for improved productivity and export performance. Positive, outward looking solutions are beyond the capacity of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, there is considerable evidence that the Government's high interest rate and recessionary strategies have been counterproductive. In recent months, we have witnessed recessed private demand, a declining profit share, a deterioration in the labour market, increased bankruptcies, and falling output and investment across significant areas of the economy. Yet despite all the policy-induced hardship, the current account has continually failed to show any significant improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The current account deficit for 1989-90 was higher than that for 1988-89, increasing from 5.3 per cent to 5.6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Net foreign debt has mounted to $124 billion. At the end of March this year, foreign debt stood at 34.3 per cent of GDP, up from 32.6 per cent at the end of June 1989. The annual debt servicing ratio has increased considerably from 17.2 per cent at the end of June last year to 19.8 per cent at the end of June this year. It is widely thought that foreign debt will not stabilise until the current account deficit is reduced to about 2.5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA> This result is hardly surprising. The Government's high interest rates have produced an artificially high Australian dollar. The dollar has defied recent attempts by the Reserve Bank of Australia to keep it down. This, in turn, has reduced the price of our imports and raised the price of our exports-the exact opposite of the result that should have been sought and achieved. High interest rates have also attracted greater foreign capital inflow, adding to the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> These are factors which the Reserve Bank itself has noted. In its annual report and financial statements of 30 June 1989, the Reserve Bank noted:</PARA>
<PARA>In the short run, there may be perverse effects on the balance of payments if higher interest rates produce an exchange rate appreciation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what we witness today. As well, the findings of two senior private sector economists were outlined in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 8 May this year in which they concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>It is probable that Australia is experiencing a policy-induced recession to solve a current account and foreign debt problem which was, in large part, the result of the policy stance itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Their conclusions are based, in part, on Reserve Bank research, the very body responsible for administering the Government's restrictive monetary policy. Indeed, in June this year, the Reserve Bank Deputy Governor, Mr John Phillips, in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Monetary policy is not primarily about resolving Australia's balance of payments problem . . . It is blindingly obvious that while tighter monetary policy reduces spending and therefore imports, which is good for the current account, higher interest rates do tend to hold up the exchange rate. That is good for inflation, but not what exporters or those competing with imports would like. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one is advocating undisciplined monetary policy. What is being pointed out is the complete bankruptcy of the Government's crude efforts at demand management as a means of addressing the current account deficit. Killing off growth in the economy is not a solution to the imbalance in savings and investment in Australia. It does nothing to address the structural problems which are the cause of this imbalance. In the absence of other policy measures, high interest rates have been and are simply a recipe for recession. Mr Phillips also noted that the Government faces a real risk that its tight monetary policy will flatten out the `real side of the economy without stabilising the price side'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's appalling performance on inflation throughout its term in office bears out this conclusion. Inflation under this Government has been far in excess of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average and is currently running at about 8 per cent. The calls by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser, for urgent government action in the area of micro-economic reform must be seen in this light. It seems that everyone but the Government is aware of the desperate need for structural reform to complement monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In its most recent annual report the Reserve Bank notes:</PARA>
<PARA>Lower inflation will assist in improving Australia's savings and competitiveness but different policies must always attack these other structural problems if sustained and excessive reliance on interest rates (with all that that implies for business investment and competitiveness, especially in the traded-goods sector) is to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>No-one seriously thinks of high interest rates as a substitute for structural adjustment, but that is the policy on which this Government has relied and, by the indicators in this Budget, on which it will continue to rely. In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) informs us that fiscal policy will now be `the Government's principal weapon in the fight against the current account deficit and our overseas debt'. But the outlays and revenue measures foreshadowed in this Budget suggest that the Treasurer is simply graduating from being a failed monetarist to a born-again big spender. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody is fooled by this Government's Budget surpluses. We all know where the money comes from. In previous years the surplus has been largely tax driven. This year it consists of a fiddling of debt between the Commonwealth and the States, asset sales, returns from government business enterprises, and a massive $370m windfall in provisional tax payments. The other area of saving is in Commonwealth payments to the States, which have been cut by $482m. If only the Government would apply the same degree of spending restraint to itself as it imposes upon the States. If it had, as Dr David Clark has pointed out, the surplus for 1989-90 would have been a massive $20 billion or more. </PARA>
<PARA> No such restraint on the part of the Commonwealth is evident in this Budget. The Commonwealth's own purpose payments will increase by 2.4 per cent in real terms in 1990-91. The real savings announced in the Budget-that is, the cuts in Commonwealth Government spending programs-are pathetic. They scrape the bottom of Labor's empty policy barrel. In contrast, the coalition's Economic Action Plan identified $2.7 billion in possible spending cuts, coupled with tax relief for Australian families. But this Government's expenditure review process could come up with only a miserable $534m in cuts from Commonwealth programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition sought a mandate for real fiscal restraint, not simply to play with the figures in the manner of the Treasurer. It is not surprising then to find that there is no substantial tax relief for Australians in this Budget. The Treasurer boasts that Australia is the third lowest taxing country in the OECD. Does he really expect us to congratulate him for keeping taxes below the levels experienced in such fiefdoms of democratic socialism as Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands? What about the United States? What about the dynamic economies of Asia, such as Hong Kong, that are not members of the OECD? Surely it is their tax performance that we should be emulating if we are serious about competing in the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The few tax concessions in this Budget are uninspiring, to say the least. They tinker at the edges of complex and burdensome tax laws which are the bane of this country's economic performance. The Government's tax law continues to be totally insensitive towards the needs of business. For example, the Treasurer will continue to require companies to decide upon and partly settle their tax obligations within 28 days of the end of the financial year, with only minor concessions. This measure, with its devastating impact on company cash flows, has acted as an effective increase in the tax burden on companies since its introduction, and all for the sake of last year's fraudulent surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> In failing to offer significant tax relief to small business-in particular, greater rollover relief under the capital gains tax-the Government has ignored the recommendations of its own Beddall report on small business. In other words, this Budget fails even the test set by members of the Treasurer's own Government, his own Party. Rather than getting on with the job of reforming and simplifying the tax law, the Treasurer sees the Budget as an excuse to take up cudgels against the coalition's consumption tax-the goods and services tax (GST) initiative. But all the while his renewed efforts to patch up the wholesale tax system announced in this Budget will give the lie to his post-1985 repudiation of a broad-based consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's criticisms of a broad based consumption tax involve a rewriting of his own consumption tax proposal in the 1985 draft White Paper-and he knows it. The Treasurer now grossly underestimates the revenue that will be collected by a GST. Similarly, he has artificially increased the amount needed to compensate individuals for the effects of such a tax. Only by distorting all the relevant assumptions-some of them his-can the Treasurer misrepresent the efficacy of a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes without saying: this Budget is a total abrogation of responsibility. It is a total abrogation of responsible government. All the significant reform measures that this country needs have been put off until some indefinite time in the future-many probably forever. The absence of any substantial measures of structural reform, whether in the form of true privatisation, wage and productivity measures or tax reform, confirms what we already know about this Government: it is paralysed by indecision. It is unable to free itself from the intellectual backwardness of its own Party and backbench. The vital decisions required of the Government are caught up in the internal processes of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The first Budget of the fourth term of this Government was where reform should have begun, and begun in earnest. Instead, we are witnessing a rerun of the Government's failed third term and the beginnings of its own demise. There is a black cloud, a pall, over the private sector economy, and the only argument about that is how we spell `pall'. The fact is that the coalition continues to set the agenda for constructive political and economic debate in this country. We are streets ahead of the Government in every major area of policy. This Budget will see us maintain that position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1990-91 Budget reaffirms the Labor Government's commitment to social justice through the implementation of important programs in a variety of portfolios. This Budget continues the work of the last seven years in fulfilling the objectives of real social justice for all Australians. I wish to concentrate my address this evening on the Hawke Government's social justice strategy-its achievements and its future initiatives. It is when one closely examines the achievements in this field over the past seven years that we are clearly able to identify that this Government has been a government of real and positive reform to enhance the lives and living standards of the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is meant by the term `social justice'? Is it just a catchy name for welfare? What does it mean for ordinary Australians? Social justice is about creating a fairer Australia for all Australians. It is about ensuring that all of the Government's programs are directed at expanding choices and opportunities for people, so that they are able to participate fully as citizens in economic, social and political life and are better able to determine the direction of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of social justice has four principal elements: equity, equality, access and participation. Equity means fairness in the distribution of economic resources. Equality means equal, effective and comprehensive civil, legal and industrial rights for all. Access means fair and equitable access to services. Participation means the opportunity to participate fully in personal development, community life and decision making. The capacity to make choices is constrained for many people because of factors such as inadequate income, gender, race, location or disability. The social justice strategy addresses the disadvantages that often result from these factors and seeks to reduce the incidence, severity and duration of disadvantage so that all in society can enjoy a decent standard of living and expanded choices. </PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the social justice strategy has required an integrated approach to the key elements of economic and social policy so that they are directed at the underlying objective of social justice. The key mechanisms utilised over the past seven years have been employment growth, wages policy and major reforms of the taxation, social security, education and training and community services systems. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the record of these achievements which underlines the fundamental differences in philosophy between Labor and our conservative opponents. Those opposite operate on the basis that the individual is all important and that the community good is secondary. The policies espoused by our opponents suggest that all things are possible in a totally free market situation where, if an individual has enough money, he or she can purchase from private enterprise any service required. To a Liberal, it is the responsibility of each person to make his own way. If people are poor, disabled or disadvantaged, that is their problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In stark contrast to this sink or swim philosophy, the Labor Government stands for the provision of high quality services to all in the community based on capacity to pay and equality of access. It is clear that governments have the most cost effective and efficient means of providing social infrastructure on an equal basis. To attempt to provide the broad range of social services on the open market would be much more expensive and would exclude the poor from any access to such services. The conservative forces continue to pursue the mythology that people can always purchase services they require in an open market situation. Such philosophical dogma ignores the reality of poverty, unemployment and disability. </PARA>
<PARA> The universal health care system, Medicare, introduced in 1984 emphasises this stark difference in approach. Under the previous conservative administration, over two million Australians were denied access to health insurance and, therefore, to decent medical attention because of this free market philosophy. Access to affordable and high quality health services and participation in decisions relating to their health are basic rights of all Australians, and it is an important element of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare provides automatic entitlement under a single public health insurance fund to medical and optometrical benefits for all. Medicare provides a universal and equitable system of health care for all Australians, financed on the basis of a progressive levy through the taxation system. It is a major contribution to the Government's social justice strategy. Medicare has been supplemented by programs such as the national women's health strategy and Aboriginal health initiatives to meet the special health needs of these groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The key priority of the Government has been, and still is, sustainable generation of employment. Employment offers opportunities and choices for people to have a decent standard of living. It is employment that offers the most effective solution to overcoming poverty. The Hawke Labor Government has been responsible for the creation of 1.7 million new jobs in its seven years in office. It has led the world in its job creation strategies and achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> This compares starkly with the record of the previous Liberal-National Party Government, which drove 600,000 families into severe poverty through unemployment because of its economic mismanagement. The social justice strategy involves a much more complex approach to employment than just job creation. It goes to the question of tackling the reasons for unemployment and the structural problems faced by certain groups seeking to enter the work force. Those four key words-equity, equality, access and participation-are all in the forefront of the Government's approach to employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Special programs to assist people who face particular disadvantages in the labour market-such as age, language difficulties, disabilities, responsibility for the care of children-and require additional assistance to help them join the labour force have all been important priorities. Through a more active approach, which is being considerably enhanced in this Budget through the active employment strategy, disadvantaged people are being provided with opportunities to escape the circumstances which cause difficulties in entering employment. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of specific programs have been set in place. The jobs, education and training (JET) program provides individual assistance such as counselling, training and educational opportunities, child-care and job placement for sole parent pensioners to help them achieve financial independence. From July 1991 unemployment benefit will be replaced with a new income support structure comprising a short term job search allowance available for those unemployed up to 12 months and a Newstart allowance for those unemployed for more than 12 months. These new structures will be accompanied by support from programs which will assist long term unemployed people back into jobs by tackling the work force barriers they face. </PARA>
<PARA> The youth social justice strategy addresses the special needs of disadvantaged young people, particularly the homeless, through an integrated set of measures to provide accommodation and special education, training and health programs. The Aboriginal employment development policy is directed at providing sustainable job opportunities for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. This is complemented by the Aboriginal education policy, which seeks to ensure equity of educational opportunities and improved outcomes for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these programs uses a coordinated approach to address special needs, recognising that a range of measures in the income support, education and training and other systems is required to assist disadvantaged people back into the work force. The programs are complemented by the high priority given to improving access to child-care facilities for the increasing number of women in the work force. Since 1983 an additional 60,000 child-care places have been created. This Budget continues the massive expansion of child-care places with the funding of an additional 50,000 places in non-profit services by 1995-96 and changes the income tested relief arrangements to make child-care more affordable for low and middle income families, including the extension of eligibility for fee relief to users of commercial and employer provided child-care centres. Our commitment to child-care is a fundamental element of the Government's strategy of expanding choices and opportunities for women, along with legislative changes such as the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action Act, as part of the national agenda for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Of major importance to social justice and the improvement of equity is the structure of the tax system. The Government has reformed the tax system over its period in office with further reductions in tax contained in this year's Budget. The tax system is now both fairer and more conducive to enhancing overall productivity and efficiency. This has been effected through closing tax avoidance and evasion shelters, taxation of capital gains and fringe benefits as well as changed arrangements for occupational superannuation. These have been accompanied by reduced tax for low and middle income families in return for the wage restraint necessary to ensure sustainable employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also many other significant areas of achievement in social security, retirement incomes, education and training, and care for the aged, but time does not permit a detailed explanation of all of these issues. Let me just say that all of these measures have achieved considerable improvement in income distribution, equality of treatment and greatly improved participation in community life. All of these things have been achieved under a Labor Government. None would even have been considered by our conservative opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's approach to implementing its social justice strategy has been to ensure that its objectives are contained in all programs and services delivered by the Government. The most appropriate way of ensuring that it is integrated into the mainstream of government administration is ensuring that within each department's program management and budgeting system, social justice objectives and implications have to be clearly identified and assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the key aims of program management and budgeting is to improve the effective management of programs. From a social justice perspective this means that program managers should consciously identify the social justice impacts of their programs and work to improve them by actively looking at ways of making them more equitable and accessible. To help ensure that social justice elements of programs are being focused on by all managers, the Government has determined that social justice aspects of program objectives should be clearly identified and that a discussion of each one's achievements in social justice terms should be incorporated in the general performance information in the portfolio explanatory notes. Departments also are required to report in their annual reports on how they perform against social justice criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand that the Government's social justice strategy is not confined to what some may call the welfare portfolios of social security, community services and health, and Aboriginal affairs. This approach encompasses all portfolios and all departments. The four key elements-equity, equality, access and participation-are relevant in all of the Government's policies and programs, whether in defence, primary industries and energy, transport and communications, or community services and health. </PARA>
<PARA> As the chairperson of the Caucus social justice committee it is my responsibility to assist in the monitoring of the implementation of our social justice objectives across the portfolios. Within that role I have the opportunity to assess the Government's legislative program on the social justice strategy. As part of the process of alerting the wider Australian community to the Government's achievements and commitments to social justice, I believe it is appropriate to request all Ministers to include an assessment of social justice implications of their proposed legislation in their speeches introducing leg- islation to the House or Senate. I know that my colleague the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) will do that. Such action would certainly highlight for all members and senators that social justice is integral to the Government's whole approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government now wishes to take the social justice strategy to a new and vitally important area. We wish to address in an integrated manner issues related to locational disadvantage. Such disadvantage arises where people live in areas where there are deficiencies in physical and social infrastructure and inadequate access to jobs, training and educational opportunities and recreational facilities, thereby reducing the standard of living of those affected, and exacerbating other disadvantages they may face. An essential first step is to work with the States and local government to analyse in depth the causes and effects of locational disadvantage and to develop a more integrated information base for the development of appropriate policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore has provided funds in the 1990-91 Budget to undertake pilot projects on locational disadvantage in a number of local areas and research programs on wider issues impacting on locational disadvantage. Both of those initiatives will be undertaken in close cooperation with State and local governments. Over the course of 1990-91 pilot projects will be undertaken in 10 separate geographical areas. The objective of the pilot projects is to provide information and suggest approaches to better integration of the planning, provision and delivery of social facilities, housing and employment and training opportunities, and transport links between them that are currently undertaken by the three levels of government. They will provide lessons for application in other geographical areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for many of the issues relevant to addressing locational disadvantage is shared by Commonwealth, State and local governments. As noted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his speech on 19 July on Commonwealth-State relations, this Government is seeking to cooperate fully with other levels of government to ensure that initiatives to address these issues are conducted in a cost efficient and effective manner to ensure successful implementation of this social justice objective. The Government has put in place the essential building blocks for further fundamental reform over the next few years. The national housing and health strategies and the research and pilot projects on locational disadvantage will provide the necessary analysis and research required to continue the Government's record of putting in place fundamental and durable reforms that progress its objective of achieving a fairer Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only redeeming feature of the Federal Budget is finally the acknowledgment by political commentators, by business analysts and, significantly, by the very heart of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) itself, that this Government and its Treasurer (Mr Keating) have failed their charter. There was no attempt this time to manage the public relations euphoria of past Keating Budgets. The confidence and the arrogance could not replace the stark recognition that the Australian so bluntly printed in Tuesday's paper, that we are now on the crumbling road to rack and ruin. Tragically, despite this public acknowledgment of failure, the real problems in our economy have not been addressed. Record interest rates, high inflation and an overvalued dollar have together produced a self-destructing financial mess that is consuming all that has been strong and enduring in our economic and social life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia today is without doubt facing its most serious economic crisis since the 1930s. Not since then has our foreign debt been such a high percentage of our gross domestic product; nor has the interest burden ratio, which is now up to 24.2 per cent, been so great. Unlike those early crisis periods when our debt situation generally was due to a major international collapse, this time the problems have been created by government. Sadly this has occurred in a period of unprecedented growth in world trade and general economic activity, which commenced right at the beginning of the Hawke Government's election in March of 1983. Clearly Government economic mismanagement is to blame, and clearly Australia no longer is in a position to be able to absorb any major external shocks. The huge productivity increases in our primary industries, both mining and agriculture, socioeconomic stability, and the decentralisation of small business and industry have been undone in a few years. </PARA>
<PARA> We in rural Australia-and I do not ignore the difficulties of the cities-are on the brink of losing control of our own destiny. For decades farms have increased in size, the commercial sectors of small towns have declined, and regional cities have expanded, mainly due to mechanisation, better transport systems, better roads and increased options for those modes of transport. As a recent paper prepared by the Economic Planning Advisory Council clearly indicates, the explosion of transport systems, communications infrastructure and technology has given Australians greater mobility. No longer are people and the services provided confined to geographical boundaries or to one jurisdiction of government. The world has changed also. We may not now like the internationalisation of Australia, but this is our nation in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> While these issues need to be addressed, they are not the major cause for the present concern, the lack of confidence, the frustration and the uncertainty. These factors alone do not explain the appalling state of small businesses, the massive decline in employment opportunities, the sharp downturn in farm incomes and the unprecedented failure of financial institutions. The latest statistics are clearly worrying. We have a stagnant economy with negative growth in the last quarter and growth for the year just gone was only in the public sector. Private sector demand is down by nearly 2 per cent. We have seen business investment fall by a massive 16.6 per cent through 1989-90 and our debt situation has continued to escalate, with the current account deficit over $20 billion in 1989-90 for the first time ever. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's gross debt burden has more than quadrupled under Labor, rising from $36 billion in March 1983 to a massive $157 billion in March this year. This figure is now running at unsustainable levels. Business Council of Australia papers prepared for the debt summit in March indicated that we would have to shift nearly 4 per cent of economic activity in net exports for the next five years merely to stabilise this debt. The papers point out that, even then, debt would continue to grow in absolute terms right up to the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> We can well see the enormity of this task and it can be judged from the fact that we have not had anything like this percentage shift in net exports in any five-year period since 1945. In fact, we have not had any shift to that degree in any single year. During the seven years of the Hawke Government, consumer prices in Australia have climbed at an annual average rate of 7.6 per cent, while the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average is just 4.1 per cent. Our core rate of inflation is the highest in the OECD and inflation in Australia has only once been below 5 per cent in the past 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's Budget does not address the causes of these problems; nor, sadly, does it offer any hope for their resolution. What is more worrying is that the burden of this serious economic climate is being borne totally by the private sector. On the Government's own forecast, in 1990-91 the public sector will be growing at a rate of 2.75 per cent while the private sector will not grow at all. Business investment is forecast to decline again by 7.25 per cent on top of the huge fall last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone knows that the Government's excessive overreliance on monetary policy is causing, and will continue to cause, the domestic economic climate to deteriorate, particularly through continued high interest rates, which have been counterproductive as far as the balance of payments is concerned. It has kept the exchange rate for the dollar well above its long term competitive level, thereby encouraging imports and discouraging exports-exactly the opposite to what Australia needs. This excessive dependence on monetary policy has been forced on the Government by its failure to take any action in the fiscal area and on other micro reform fronts. This is having disastrous effects on Australian business, particularly small business, and on families and those attempting to purchase family homes. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a massive 26 per cent rise in the level of bankruptcies in the year to June and this figure alone bears testimony to the Government's failure.  The Australian Labor Party has been forced to corrupt its own party platform in the areas of communication and transport and, through mismanagement, it has created an irony that could well work to Australia's advantage if efficiencies are ultimately achieved. However, the fact that nothing is being done to help the expanding debt and to encourage savings places extreme limits on any spending that micro-economic reform will demand. Every member of this House knows, if he or she is prepared to analyse this Budget honestly, that these two requirements are not achievable. They require either cuts in public sector spending or major taxation rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The big ticket items of social security and health have not been touched in this Budget; and health, with the monster of Medicare raging out of control on both the demand and the supply side, threatens ultimately to consume the system and further impede other areas of social progress and reform. Of course, the Treasurer has managed, quite cleverly, to expand Federal Government outlays, but to transfer the huge burden of service delivery and debt to State and local government. These two areas of government have little capacity to deliver, and there is no doubt that at that level we shall see major retractions of essential services. Again, it is the ultimate irony that the Labor Party has, through mismanagement, subverted its long term platform of wealth redistribution. Its platform is now one of debt redistribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some comment on the recently announced changes to Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd and Telecom Australia. These changes have, unfortunately, been made for entirely the wrong reasons and the compromises that have been necessary in order to satisfy the factional differences within the Labor Party will not produce the benefits of competition or privatisation for the Australian public. The only reason that the ALP was forced to go through the trauma of the past weeks was its inability to fund the public sector with the capital requirements that these national authorities demanded. Only time will tell if the Telecom-OTC proposal will get the all-clear from the ALP conference. Only time will tell if this massive conglomerate gives Australia the capacity to meet the challenges and the dynamism of the new technology and communications revolution that could offer so much for Australia's future. It is therefore tragic that such an important decision is not being made with Australia's best interests in mind, but simply as a means of overcoming the paralysis in a government torn to pieces by factions and outdated ideology and awaiting the call from its masters outside this House. </PARA>
<PARA> What is clearly obvious is the fact that the Hawke-Keating Government is now totally out of touch with the worsening economic and social conditions outside Canberra, the nature and depth of the recession in small business and the growing impact of falling commodity prices on the mining and primary industry sector. The very socio-economic fabric of our rural towns and cities has never before been under such threat. Decades of economic and social progress, established by community and voluntary effort in cooperation with government, languishes under high interest rates, excessive red tape and regulation, and uncompetitive transport costs. Of course, we can now add to that list. I refer particularly to my State of Victoria and the collapse of, and loss of confidence by many people in, our building societies and property trusts. Few businesses and families have been left untouched by these collapses, either directly or indirectly, as their savings or investments have been lost or frozen, the building industry grinds to a halt and many businesses find that they are unable to pay many of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's policies have not worked but we see no changes, and added to the total economic vandalism and incompetence that I mentioned in my own State of Victoria we must now have deep concerns about the future. This Budget provided an opportunity to give a boost to our productivity and improve our export performance. It appears that that opportunity has again been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Mallee electorate that I represent depends very much on the productivity of rural production and exports. The industries that service them, the extension services of government departments, the small factories and the engineering works would not exist without the agricultural sector. It is in this regard that I am most disappointed about the outcome of this Budget because I believe we could have expected at least some understanding from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). But we see major cost increases placed upon the rural sector at a time when it is simply unable to cope with an increased burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Federal Government and the primary industry portfolio contributed $445.5m to the agricultural and fishing industries. This year there has been a decrease to $423.3m and over the next three years we will see this figure drop to some $308.9m. That is an indictment of any commitment by this Government to the most important sector in the Australian economy. At the same time, while the Government contribution falls, the rural community is paying some $1,369.9m in levies and charges. Of this, $429.7m is from the recent increase in taxes paid by woolgrowers from an increase in levy from 8 per cent to 18 per cent and from the $21m increase in levies to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> This big leap in export costs and charges on export inspection, domestic meat inspection and quarantine charges will go forward as from 1 January next. Overnight, charges will go from a 60 per cent cost recovery to a 100 per cent cost recovery. This comes at a critical time for many export industries, especially the farmers facing a 48 per cent decrease in net farm production this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not always agreed with-in fact I have actively opposed on a number of occasions-many of the changes the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has made under his portfolio in recent years, particularly those to the Australian Wheat Board. At this time of low commodity prices, we have lost that important price buffer on the domestic market provided by earlier wheat legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the Australian wool industry is confronted with an appalling situation. I acknowledge the renewed commitment in recent days by the Government to our greatest industry but the uncertainty and speculation due to the nature and the process of earlier action has been highly damaging, both domestically and internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that statements made by the Minister over the past few months indicated that he appeared to understand the need for conservation policies to be in balance with development policies, one must now question this commitment when seeing that some $5.2m of the primary industry budget has been used to help lock up native forests and World Heritage payments allocated under the forestry development program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These off-the-cuff gratuitous insults from the Minister are no substitute for fundamental policy objectives and priorities aimed at correcting errors of the past and to ensure stability and productivity for the future. The Minister's comments-made no doubt to impress the isolated Fabians of Canberra-are substantially untrue. The planning by the Chaffeys of the Sunraysia irrigation area and the urban infrastructure were far ahead of their time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply ask honourable members to personally inspect and compare the Sunraysia area in my electorate with the unplanned, inadequate infrastructures and chaos of many of our major cities. While some argument can be developed on the suitability of many soils presently under irrigation throughout Australia, the structure of the deep, sandy loams of the Mildura area are a stark exception. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my comments on the Budget by dealing with an area of change which has received little national media attention but which will be devastating in its effect. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) speak so highly of the Hawke Government's social justice program. The honourable member mentioned four principles: equity, equality, access and participation. In one area the Hawke Government has failed on all counts, and I refer particularly to the discriminatory asset test on family allowances, family allowance supplement and Austudy eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA> These new asset test levels will create huge problems in the equitable provision of Government services. No doubt this change satisfies the philosophical bent of the Australian Labor Party, as the truth is that these changes mean that no farmers and few small business people will qualify. Farmers and business people will lose the benefit if they have $300,000 in assets and no allowance will be made for additional children. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House to compare this to a wage earner who can earn up to $57,620 and still qualify for family allowance and have this amount increased for each child. Farms of this value have no capacity to generate income at this level. The drop in maximum allowable assets from $322,750 to $200,000 for the family supplement will end this benefit for farmers and owner-operated country town business people. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy has also been attacked and, with the 50 per cent farm-business discount, claims will be allowed up to $400,000, but even this will rule out most farming families. Worse still, students are being advised to manipulate the system-to cheat-in order to afford a tertiary education. Some students have realised that through arranged marriages and immediate separation they can be better placed to be assessed for assets as individuals. What a shameful state this nation has been driven to. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time country students who must live away from home for senior secondary and tertiary education have had their return trip entitlement reduced from three to two per year. I call upon the Government to review and to amend this appalling decision. It shows a total lack of social equity and will ensure that the erosion of people from rural Australia will escalate to the disadvantage of those students and families directly affected and to the future maintenance of the social and economic fabric of our nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 7.30 on the night of 23 August I turned up in the chamber to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) deliver his speech in reply to the Budget. My presence here was partly accidental. There was a malfunction in the paging system within the Parliament that night. For some reason my pocket pager was receiving a message coming from the office of the Opposition Whip. The message said, `Come into the chamber immediately'. So I did. However, having arrived here, I settled back to listen to the speech and I tried to assume the role of a dispassionate observer-one looking at both sides of the question in an attempt to form an objective judgment about the Leader of the Opposition and his reply on the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From that standpoint, I found the reply on the Budget by the Leader of the Opposition very disappointing-in fact the weakest that I have listened to in the 10 years I have been a member of Parliament. It was a speech that was both feeble and unconvincing by any analysis. The Leader of the Opposition commenced his speech with the claim that the Budget must be redone and it must be redone with a package of essential measures which he intended to outline on the evening of 23 August. How did the Leader of the Opposition go about establishing the proposition that the Budget needed to be redone? Did he succeed in presenting Parliament with a package of what he called essential measures?</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition began his speech with what was essentially a series of hollow appeals-a series of appeals to groups that are in fact faring far better under Labor in current times than they every would under a coalition government. The appeals were hollow because people can remember what life was like under the coalition and they can recognise a bottle of snake oil when they see it. Four groups attracted the attention of the Leader of the Opposition: home owners, industry and business, the needy, and the young. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition said that members of the Government should get out and talk to those people struggling to buy a home on mortgage interest rates of 16 per cent and those who are forced to sell their home in a falling market. The Leader of the Opposition said that Government members should get out and talk to those families in which both parents have been forced to go to work just to pay the mortgage and the supermarket bills. He said they should walk up and down any street in any city, suburb or town and count the empty shops and the `for sale' signs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have certainly done those things; Government members do. It is our job to get out and talk to people in our electorates, particularly home owners and buyers. This is what they tell us. They tell us that life is certainly not a bowl of cherries at the moment, but at the same time they know that they would never have had the opportunity to buy a home under a coalition government. They recognise that many of them simply would not have had jobs had the coalition continued in government in 1983. They know that second income to which the Leader of the Opposition refers would never be coming in without job growth and without the expansion of children's services that has been provided under Labor. Oh, yes, we certainly get out and talk to them; more than that, we listen, so home buyers are represented in the communities in which we live and work. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year under the gaze of television cameras from a current affairs program I talked to a group of home buyers in my electorate, a group from Kingsley Close, Kingswood. I must say that these home purchasers demonstrated a degree of understanding for which the Leader of the Opposition simply fails to give them credit. These people knew of the impact of the balance of payments on the economy. They knew-and they told me-of the impact that proposed Liberal Party cuts on government services would have on their standard of living. They knew of the effect of wages deregulation and open slather in the labour market would have on the living standards of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked. While they certainly were not happy people, neither were they voting for the coalition. They certainly did not in the last election. In my electorate it was the worst result for the Liberal Party in very many years. The reason for that was that those people knew that there was no quick fix for interest rates. </PARA>

They may have had some confidence in me, but they also certainly had confidence in the policy of the Government which has been delivering for them since the election and will continue to deliver for them in the form of lower interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition also directed an appeal to business and to industry. He talked of industry complaints, black bans, go-slows, stop-works and labour market deals. We on this side of the House certainly talk to industry as well. This is what industry tells us. It tells us that it is pleased with our record. It tells us that it is pleased with the dramatic fall in industrial disputation under Labor. It is pleased with the success of the accord. Industry and business certainly know and value a government which believes in cooperation rather than confrontation in solving difficulties and disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition appealed to the needy-that is a group that the Opposition can certainly identify with. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said. He appealed to the Government to get out and talk to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the genuinely needy in Australia, the sick, the aged, the genuinely unemployable, who have to get by on less because others who could otherwise pull their weight in our society have been allowed to rip off the welfare system-a system which makes it easier to put out your hand than to help yourself or lift your game. </PARA>
<PARA>We certainly talk with the needy. I know that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), talks with people in his electorate and members on this side do. This is what they tell us. They know that pensions and benefits have risen in real terms under this Government after a period in which they fell in real terms under the coalition. They know and are pleased that indexation of pensions and benefits has been brought forward under this Government. They appreciate the major reforms that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) when Minister for Social Security brought in in family assistance, and the wonderful success of the family allowance supplement program after the failed program of the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> They know that all of this has been made possible only by careful targeting of benefits, by assets testing and by the introduction of schemes such as the child support system. The Leader of the Opposition referred to rip-offs, but the facts are that there has been in the social security system increasing vigilance. We have instituted better systems for the delivery of pensions and benefits, particularly through the bank credit system of pensions and benefits. A range of other measures have also been introduced to prevent abuse of the system. But how high can the Leader of the Opposition's criticism be when we remember that it was his Party that worked to destroy the Australia Card proposal and I am sure would, if it possibly could, destroy the effectiveness of the tax file number system which will be so effective in reducing rip-offs. </PARA>
<PARA> But while talking of pensioners and the Budget, I want to refer to two matters of concern that have arisen following the Budget. They concern changes to pharmacy benefits for pensioners and the introduction of the deeming system. I must say that I recognise that any change that involves this group causes some confusion and concern. Most of that concern is unnecessary, but the changes that have been introduced are certainly absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the new pharmacy measures. The introduction of a charge against the backdrop of a scheme in which costs have been blowing out at an increasing rate is absolutely necessary. When one considers that the cost to the taxpayer of a single prescription item would, I suppose, be around $50 if one assumes an average cost of a drug of around $25, a dispensing fee of $4.85, and cost of a doctor's visit of $20, obviously careful controls have to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> One should also consider the waste that results from drugs being prescribed but not used. They are frequently held in large quantities by pensioners and become outdated, in which case an associated danger also needs to be taken into account. Drugs that are out of date and easily confused lead to some thousands of pensioners, I understand, being hospitalised each year because they have been taken incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the charge of $2.50 will make doctors more careful in prescribing drugs. At the same time the pension will be increased by $2.50 a week for single pensioners and after 52 prescriptions, subsequent prescriptions will be provided free. As the average pensioner receives only 27 scripts a year, the average pensioner is clearly $62.50 a year better off under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Some problems have arisen. I understand now that all State housing departments are cooperating and not treating that increase as part of the income for rental purposes. That is one possible difficulty which I believe has been overcome. The other difficulty which was resolved by the Government in recent days concerns those pensioners in receipt of large numbers of prescriptions that are absolutely necessary for them-in other words, the chronically ill. I certainly welcome the Government's decision to provide a $50 advance to assist those people. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I point out that pensioners receiving large numbers of scripts in fact represent very good business to pharmacists. I would have thought it would be in pharmacists' interests anyway to operate a credit system. The record for prescriptions so far goes to a lady in Brisbane who claims to require 27 prescription items a week. If we take that case and assume that they are all absolutely necessary, we see that that lady would be worth to her pharmacist $4.85 times 27 a week in prescription fees. That is worth $133.45 a week in business to him. I would have thought she represented a very good business to him and would be a real incentive for that pharmacist to operate a credit scheme. However, the $50 advance will solve her problem in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that that reform will certainly benefit the average pensioner. It will take care, with its adjustment, of the chronically ill pensioner and it will take care of abuses because under the current scheme the real beneficiaries have not been the pensioners at all. They have been doctors, pharmacists and drug companies. In particular, I was concerned to read in the Herald of complaints about chemists in Grafton and Brisbane who, two days after the Budget, were telling pensioners that the new scheme had been introduced and was effective immediately and were charging pensioners. So I think parts of those professions really need to look at their ethical standards. I am sure that standards throughout those professions by and large are very good and I expect that there will be positive efforts to make sure that this new scheme works well and is introduced smoothly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to direct some remarks to an aspect of the Gulf crisis that has so far not received much public comment-that is, Australia's relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the PLO. All Australians would no doubt be pleased to see a solution to the so-called Palestinian problem determined by negotiations between the parties concerned in a way that brought ongoing secure borders, peace and stability to all countries in that troubled part of our world. Accordingly, the renunciation of terrorism by the PLO some 18 months ago came as a welcome step toward the reconciliation process. Unfortunately, however, recent developments give real cause for concern and serious reservations must now be expressed on whether the PLO has changed its objectives and its methods of achieving them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year some Israeli tourists were attacked in Egypt by PLO activists. Then several months later an Iraqi-sponsored PLO associate attempted to make a terrorist assault on some of Israel's crowded summertime beaches. These breaches of PLO undertakings should have resulted in, at the very least, some form of denunciation by the Hawke Government, but they did not. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), previously quite sympathetic to Israel's interests, has by his stance and his silence placed Australia in a position where we might be seen to be condoning those PLO activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The moderate Arab states have now started to distance themselves from the PLO. This process has been sharply accelerated as a result of the new association between the PLO and Iraq. The world stands appalled by the actions of the dictator of Iraq. In addition to the eight-year war he initiated with Iran, he has bombed and gassed his own people, attempted to blackmail the Gulf states to raise arbitrarily the price of crude oil, which would have been a serious threat to Australia's economic interests, then invaded and annexed the sovereign state of Kuwait and now holds citizens of other countries as hostages. He has been unanimously condemned for his latest acts of aggression by everyone except the PLO. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that; the PLO has been vocal in its support of Iraq. Recent statements by the PLO and its associates include: `We declare our support for Iraq', made at the May Baghdad Arab summit; `Strike at the interests of the treacherous agents in the Arab nations'; `Open fire on the American enemy everywhere. Quake the earth under the feet of the invaders and collaborators'. Further, how anyone could be associated with the Iraqi dictator's declaration that `his chemical missiles would incinerate Israel with fire' is quite beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA> As reported in the Australian newspaper in the last few weeks, not only has the PLO said that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is another step toward liberation of Palestine but also that much of the logistical planning for the invasion was derived from intelligence supplied by PLO workers and officials based in Kuwait. It seems beyond question that the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait took place with the active support and blessing of the PLO. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) has said in the last few days that the Government will not change its current relationship with the PLO. That is not good enough. It is clearly time for Australia to rethink its relations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and the Government has an obligation to do so as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not need to remind those honourable members present of the importance to all Australians of the Federal Government's Greening Australia program. To this end I am very proud of what has been done in my electorate. In a joint project in February of this year between Greening Australia, Redbank Plains High School, Taubmans Paints and the Moreton Shire Council, Mrs Hazel Hawke, the wife of our Prime Minister and the patron of Greening Australia, officially opened the newly named Greening Australia Park, a park that adjoins the Redbank Plains High School in my electorate. This event also saw the planting of over 1,000 trees, which I understand was the beginning of Greening Australia's program to plant over one billion trees. The cost of these trees was sponsored by Taubmans Paints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aim of this project is to conserve native vegetation on the site and to establish three local plant communities, these being rainforest and a closed canopy forest including paperbarks, ti-trees and gums in this woodland. The students of Redbank Plains High School have taken on the caring of these trees as a special project under the guidance of their school principal, Mr Rod Simson. I was particularly pleased to be associated with this and also with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), the Minister then responsible for that area, and also the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) from the Federal electorate of Rankin. </PARA>
<PARA> The trees are all growing pretty well. Some people who were there that day must have had green fingers because some 86 per cent of the trees are still growing particularly well. The students, the school and Mr Simson are to be commended for the way they have actively participated in the Greening Australia program. As their Federal representative, I have been pleased to assist with this project. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia, which is the topic of the moment, of course, does many good things in our community. It had a facility in the corner of the park. The management committee of the new park suggested to me that the perimeter fence needed tidying up and that it would be good if we could have some trees planted around it. I took this matter up with Telecom on behalf of the management committee. Telecom also has a line depot on this site. Whilst these facilities are necessary, I certainly shared the views of the committee that the greening of the fenceline would lend itself more to the picturesque surroundings of the park. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to take this up and I have recently been advised by Telecom that it would be pleased to participate in the greening of its perimeter fence. For this I put on record my deep appreciation for Telecom's participation in this way. However, Telecom will be selling part of this land within the next six months and it has indicated to me that it will be offering the land to the Moreton Shire Council, the local authority. I am very pleased about that too and I hope that the Moreton Shire Council will take up that option and will convert it into parkland. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased with the response from Greening Australia and pleased to have participated in this item of national significance. As I said earlier, I understand it was one of the first works commenced as part of the Greening Australia program. The program is part of the national goal of Greening Australia, which will see one billion trees planted by the year 2000. This program fits well into the mix of measures the Government has put together to combat the problems of soil erosion, land degradation and salinity. In my view, this demonstrates the Government's recognition that more is required than merely planting trees. </PARA>
<PARA> The national soil conservation program, Landcare Australia Limited and Greening Australia are working cohesively to address Australia's pressing environmental problems. Through the participation in Greening Australia Park the people of the Oxley electorate are playing a very vital part. I would like to put on record my appreciation to all those associated with this program and to thank particularly the local school, Redbank Plains High School, for its participation. The project was really the school's idea. I particularly thank the school principal, Mr Simson. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cheryl Kernot, the Australian Democrats' spokesman for transport, in a letter to the Gold Coast Bulletin on 8 September states that she remains unconvinced that deregulation of the airlines will lead to the economic benefits which Mr Dick Smith, Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, outlined in a speech to the National Press Club recently. Senator Kernot says further in her letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>My major concern with the deregulation of the airlines however, is the potential effect on passenger safety. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Kernot is doing little more than scaremongering. The competition that will arise in what is currently a very small market will ensure that safety standards are maintained and improved. One mistake or accident by a single airline could cost it its entire business in such a highly competitive field. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States flying has proved to be safer since deregulation. In the nine years leading up to deregulation there was an average of 33 fatal and non-fatal accidents a year. In the first nine years following, that number was reduced to 20 a year. Considering the enormous increase in flights and passenger numbers since deregulation in the United States the improvements are even more pronounced. Fatal accidents in the United States per million miles travelled declined by a staggering 57 per cent. Also in America the number of Americans using aircraft has doubled since deregulation there, resulting in an average of 1,700 fewer road fatalities and 66,000 fewer injuries due to road accidents each year. This has special significance in Australia where most of the highways between our capital cities are precarious at best. Senator Kernot also appears to have doubts about the cost benefits of deregulation for all air travellers. Air fares in the United States declined by 21 per cent between 1978 and 1988, saving the American travelling public about $100 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all of this Senator Kernot's attitude does not surprise me. The Democrats tend to be way out of step when it comes to economic rationalisation. Australia is just about to break free of the shackles of the two-airline policy and there is a real sense of anticipation that the move will be the salvation of the domestic tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines have served us well for many years but we now have a more mature market and competition that other carriers will provide will see a major revitalisation of domestic aviation and cheaper air fares for all Australians. Senator Kernot can be concerned if she wants but I assure her and the Australian Democrats that her fears and their fears are completely without foundation. The 84 per cent of Australians who currently do not fly regularly, largely due to the cost, are looking forward to cheaper air fares and higher safety standards that will result from deregulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to raise a matter of international interest. I welcome the opportunity given me by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to clarify my position on the development of industry in Australia. Yesterday the Minister claimed that I had said that we should `do the development first and then solve the problems'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister was referring to a speech I made to the Murray Valley League in Murray Bridge on 31 August when I was explaining that we should make a decision to approve the development of the Australian Newsprint Mills expansion program by some $600m first and set the rules so that the corporation can then work out how to do it in a way which does not damage the environment and may even enhance it. </PARA>
<PARA> I gave that conference an example of a French company that I visited in 1975 and which was coerced by the French Government to move into a remote rural area by a soft loan. The one condition was that there should be absolutely no pollution at the end of every day or week from that factory. That was at the time held to be impossible. However, as the coercion, if you like, of the soft loans encouraged the factory, technology solved the problem and at the end of every day a few jars of ash were put on the rose garden. That factory is flourishing to this day. </PARA>
<PARA> My point, which was distorted or perhaps misunderstood by the Minister, was that if one makes a decision, sets the rules and sticks to them, one is much more likely to enable corporate Australia to solve the problems that confront it. If one keeps changing the rules, Australian corporations, given the choice-and many of them now are-may finally make the decision to go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Tragically, four of Australia's major corporations-CSR, Boral, Adsteam and Amcor and others perhaps that we do not know about-have made that decision in the last 12 months. Indeed, Amcor has spent about $450m overseas in the past 18 months buying packaging companies in North America and France and building fibrebox plants in Britain and California. This company has found it easier to build plants in other places than to build them in Australia and is looking to direct capital expenditure overseas after having invested $2 billion in Australia in new plants and acquisitions in the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to say that I had said that conservation had been in the hands of very powerful urban conservation commandos who used scare tactics to coerce support. </PARA>

It is for people and by people, and a vital part of this plan is an informed and ecologically responsible public'.</PARA></TALK.START>

I warned them then that they may succeed if responsible Australians do not stand up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening to my good friend the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free), I am tempted to make some comment about the upcoming events this weekend, but I will refrain from doing so. I must comment, though, that in May this year I did make some prophecy about the events which would unfold and the victories that would lie ahead for the Brisbane Broncos. They are well and truly on track to meet that goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address the chamber this evening to congratulate the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) and the Government on introducing the new superannuation scheme applicable to Defence Force personnel. I have the pleasure of representing, amongst others, the service men and women attached to the Enoggera army barracks in Brisbane. They are indeed a fine group of people. They have up until recently been contributing to a superannuation scheme, the old defence force retirement and death benefits (DFRDB) scheme, which was in many respects well and truly out of date in its provisions. Put in a nutshell, those contributing to that scheme were required to remain in the system for 20 years in order to get any benefits back other than their own contributions. That may well have been a yardstick common throughout the superannuation industry in years gone by, but it is clear that in the last decade that system has changed dramatically in the community and that vesting rights which are normally available to others in the community had been denied those in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to see that following a review and an examination of the DFRDB, the Minister and this Government have made some very substantial and important changes to that superannuation scheme which provide real and tangible benefits to Australia's service men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas other schemes have introduced vesting rights that enable contributors to receive either part or full employer contributions after a reasonable period of time-for example, 10, 15 or 20 years-the Defence Force scheme lagged behind. The new scheme, I am happy to say, provides for service personnel to receive interest on the contributions that are made and for them to receive increasing entitlements of employer benefit according to their years of service. Beyond that there is a full payment at 15 years of service which ensures that service personnel are no longer required to remain within the armed forces for the 20 years. Clearly this has some implications for the retention rate difficulties that the defence forces have faced in recent years. The Government has taken steps not only to remedy the superannuation entitlements that they have, but also to ensure that the defence forces do not lose experienced officers and staff as a result of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government, as part of this package, has introduced a selective retention benefits scheme which provides selected defence personnel with an additional payment of one year's salary after 15 years of service. That is a very substantial incentive for those long serving defence personnel to enlist for a further five years, providing a substantial payment to them whilst at the same time giving them a realistic opportunity to leave the defence forces short of the 20 years and take with them at that time a substantial amount of superannuation-importantly, an amount of superannuation which will include a contribution from the employer and the interest thereon. Of course this is all over and above the 3 per cent productivity benefits which apply in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that that 3 per cent productivity superannuation which applies throughout industry is for many the only source of superannuation benefit they receive-a great initiative of the trade union movement and the Government through the accord and providing many Australians with some form of long term security which they would otherwise not have. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to commend the Minister and the Government for the way in which they have set about explaining these important changes to the defence personnel. The material which has been produced and distributed by way of the various service newspapers and specifically designed brochures and booklets has provided the necessary background for service personnel to make their decisions as to which scheme they wish to belong to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to draw the attention of the House to a particularly objectionable aspect of our current Industrial Relations Act-more specifically, section 299 of that Act. Members of the public and no doubt members of the House are aware of the recent use of this section-or its equivalent under the old Conciliation and Arbitration Act-against the former Secretary of the Victorian Builders Labourers Federation (BLF), Norm Gallagher. Whilst one could never condone the actions of the former BLF Secretary nor the means by which he operated there are nevertheless a number of very disturbing features about the ambit and operation of section 299.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A case presently before the courts-an action by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Nationwide News-serves as a poignant example. Section 299 states that a person shall not, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by writing or speech use words calculated . . . to bring a member of the Commission or the Commission into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA>The penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 or six months imprisonment for a person, or $1,000 for a body corporate. The case itself concerns a prosecution instigated by Justice Maddern and the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) against the publishers of the Australian newspaper for an article published on 14 November 1989 in which Max Newton, journalist now deceased, made some rather hostile comments about the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, the Commission was not enamoured with what Mr Newton had to say and demanded that an action be launched in accordance with section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act. The first thing which has to be said is that the section itself represents an extraordinary immunity against criticism for what is in effect a statutory body. </PARA>
<PARA> Of all the institutions worthy of debate, analysis and objective assessment there would be no better candidate than the IRC at such a crucial time in Australia's history. I do not want to speculate on the details of the case because, as I have said, it is currently before the courts. I do, however, wish to make quite plain the undesirability of section 299 and the severe restrictions it places on one of our most fundamental democratic rights-the freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all well aware that Australia is facing stagnation and a decline because of our outdated, inflexible and highly intransigent industrial relations framework. Why then should the main arbitrator of the system not be deserving of at least an analysis if not an objective critique for its role in our current economic crisis?</PARA>
<PARA> The ambit of section 299 is that virtually anything said or written about the Commission or its members, unless fawning in its flattery, as Paddy McGuinness of the Australian has remarked, may be interpreted as bringing him, it or her into disrepute. In other words, anything which may be interpreted as critical of the Commission faces a good chance of prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of its very existence as a statutory body, its performance should be continually scrutinised and debated, if only as a means to ensuring its continued relevance in our industrial framework. The fact is that section 299 sets up a barrier to effective and quite possibly useful analysis of its role as an arbitrator in our industrial relations system. It provides a protective screen behind which the Commission is able to do virtually anything it desires, including the perpetuation of its own entrenched position in our present industrial framework. So much for the principles of freedom of speech-the very lifeblood of democracy and community well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps more disturbing is the implied threat it poses to all other newspapers and publishers and television and radio broadcasters who, by virtue of their own independence of mind, find both the Commission and its decisions somewhat iniquitous. In effect, the threat is an implied direction that a commentator must look not only to the normal laws of defamation and contempt but also to censorship of any comment at all capable of being construed as critical of the Commission or face the penalty. Worse still, no-one is beyond the reach of section 299, except seemingly a politician speaking within the bounds of parliamentary privilege. Hence my comments tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that Newton's comments were not particularly respectful of the Commission or of those sitting on its benches, but the article does not impute improper motives or slander any particular individual. Perhaps it does offer for public interest the other side of the coin-the side of which the public is rarely made aware. The present action against Nationwide publishers merely serves to stifle legitimate public debate on the role and behaviour of the Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A study on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases, conducted on behalf of the World Health Organisation (WHO), has been brought to my attention.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised however, that the report on the study has yet to be released or endorsed by the WHO. I understand that the report is likely to be presented to the Executive Board of the WHO in January 1991 for its consideration, and that Australia will be represented at that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Minister for Community Services and Health has advised that the WHO proposal does not run counter to current scientific opinion. It is the general scientific view that simple refined sugars should be distinguished from other simple and complex carbohydrates because unrefined simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates are associated with other essential nutrients and fibre in food. This is the basis for present Australian nutritional labelling legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The impact of any WHO proposal will depend on the extent to which member countries can and actively seek to implement recommended courses of action. Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding this issue, any estimate of the effects of such a proposal must be dubious at best.</PARA>
<PARA> On the issue of increased hunger in developing countries, the Minister for Community Services and Health has advised that the diets of low income populations are frequently deficient in nutrients and while the consumption of simple refined sugars increases the intake of energy it does not overcome this deficiency. Indeed, excess consumption of sugar could reduce the overall nutritional quality of national diets.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Australia's position in respect of the final WHO report, will reflect the goals and targets contained in the Health for All Australia Report which is the basis for the National Better Health Program. This program is Australia's response to the WHO objective, Health for All by the Year 2000, and it includes nutrition as a priority area. In respect of sugar, the Australian goal has been defined as `to reduce the contribution of refined sugars to dietary energy from 14% (1983-84) to 12 per cent or less by the year 2000'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Science and Technology Awareness Section administers the $800,000 annual funding for the Science and Technology Awareness Program announced in the May 1989 policy statement. The Program aims to raise public awareness of the central role of science and technology in national life, and consists of 4 major inter-related elements agreed by Ministers: Australia Prize, Journalists Awards, Science Information Projects and Industry-Science Forum. Staff cover of $70,000 was also provided for in the Budget allocation of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australia Prize: (a) $410,000; (b) Prize money of $250,000; initial start-up costs: including market research, design consultancy, corporate and publicity materials, medals and presentation packaging; and on-going administrative costs: including Committee travel and accommodation, printing and postage, public relations consultancy, winners' travel and accommodation; (c) No. Total expenditure for this element amounted to $390,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Michael Daley Awards for Science and Technology Journalism: (a) $20,000; (b) Prize money, fares, publicity, judging costs; (c) No. Total expenditure amounted to $19,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Science information projects: (a) $270,000; (b) Education resource materials, speakers, conferences, targeted media program productions including co-productions with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, projects with science centres including a feasibility study for an Australian science, technology and innovation interactive exhibition and prototyping of a travelling interactive maths exhibition; (c) Yes. The balance of the Program funds, $313,000, was committed to Science Information projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Support was also provided to the Australian Academy of Science for the Australian Science and Technology Information Service proposal: (a) $20,000; (b) Support for feasibility study; (c) Yes. $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA> Industry-Science Forum: (a) $10,000; (b) Not applicable; (c) No. Planning for the implementation of this element of the Program was interrupted by the announcement of the election. A new format is being developed for 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA> Departmental staff cover: (a) $70,000; (b) Salary and administration; (c) No. $55,000. It has been possible to undertake the administration of the Program more efficiently than had been anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Currently four; (b) AS08, AS07, ASO5, AS04 at 1 June 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) At no time has anybody in the Section worked full-time on the Australia Prize element of the Program; (b) At no time has there been more than four persons in the Section involved part-time to any extent with the administration of the Australia Prize element of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australia Prize comprises $250,000 prize money and an inscribed medal. The administrative costs of this element of the Program are estimated as $75,000 start up costs, and $65,000 administrative costs which are expected to be on-going.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. The actual costs of administration of the Australia Prize element have been less than anticipated.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) Leo Schofield and Associates were the successful tenderers for the public relations consultancy for the Australia Prize element of the Science and Technology Awareness Program. In responding to the consultancy brief, Leo Schofield and Associates carried out more duties than simply advertising the Australia Prize to the Australian and international media.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The consultancy was let in response to quotation by tender, which is normal practice for projects involving creative work and materials. Four quotations were sought and three were received. The Department was advised and assisted in this process by the Office of Government and Advertising. As is usual practice, this consultancy was approved within the public relations outline for the Science and Technology Awareness Program by the Ministerial Committee on Government Information and Advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Staff from the Department briefed and liaised with Leo Schofield and Associates regularly as part of the management of the consultancy, as well as providing advice as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) A consultancy contract for $19,500 was let to Leo Schofield and Associates to provide a diverse and wide range of public relations activities including: preparation of media briefs and releases, media liaison, advice and assistance in organising the winners' programs and events associated with the awarding of the Prize, facilitating the engagement of key personnel for specific activities, and other public relations activities to promote the Australia Prize as an element of the Science and Technology Awareness Program. (b) Costs of the Australia Prize presentation evening were borne by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. That Department has advised that the cost of conducting the evening was $31628.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The publicity strategy for the Australia Prize included a public lecture by the winners, research seminars in Canberra, Adelaide and Sydney, meetings with senior research managers and young scientists, the Presentation Dinner hosted by the Prime Minister to which some 400 government, industry, youth and science community representatives were invited and use of the occasion in a video to encourage young scientists. It is not practical to separate the coverage associated with the announcement from that associated with the presentation. (a) The announcement of the winners of the inaugural Australia Prize received good coverage in the Australian media. For example, the announcement of the winners of the Australia Prize was the lead article on ABC TV's Quantum program for the 1990 series, on the evening of the announcement. The announcement was also carried by at least 27 print media outlets, covering newspapers and specialist magazines, and by radio and TV evening news bulletins. Additionally, interviews with the Australian winner were carried by 6 commercial and 3 ABC National radio stations. The only negative publicity about the Australia Prize was a number of articles by commentator Dr Peter Pockley. (b) International coverage was not fully monitored. Some examples of coverage are: 65 articles in German print media, three in international magazines, and an interview broadcast by BBC radio.</PARA>
