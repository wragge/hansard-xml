<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure on greater opportunities for debate on reports from parliamentary committees, presented on 11 October, the Committee recommended, among other matters, that orders of the day for the resumption of debate on motions moved in relation to committee or delegation reports should appear in a discrete section of the Notice Paper. To give effect to this recommendation required no amendment of the Standing or Sessional Orders or any action by the House. Consequently, the Notice Paper this week has been rearranged as recommended by the Committee and this new style will be used in subsequent issues of the Notice Paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The remaining recommendations of the Committee are, of course, matters for consideration and possible action by the House itself, and I would expect that the Government's response to those recommendations will be made known to the House in due course.</PARA>

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this morning to speak to the report on debate on parliamentary committee reports as Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure which gave rise to the report but, more importantly, as one member of parliament who wishes to see parliament and, in particular, this chamber operate and work more effectively, in short, work better. I might say that I am not alone in this and have support, I believe, on both sides of the Parliament, as I hope will this Committee report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Making the Parliament work better and operate more effectively is what the Procedure Committee report is all about. The report brings forward recommendations which I hope will achieve this in one particular respect. As the Daily Program and the Notice Paper list, the title of the report is Greater Opportunities for Debate on Reports from Parliamentary Committees. That title says it all because it is about giving greater opportunities for debate on reports from parliamentary committees. This particular report recommends minor changes to the Standing and Sessional Orders to give just that-a greater opportunity for members of this chamber to debate reports of parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The background of this is to be found in the ongoing work of the Procedure Committee. The Committee, chaired by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), is constantly reviewing the Standing and Sessional Orders of the House and looking for ways in which we might improve the way in which we deliberate and the way in which we conduct ourselves. This report seeks to give greater recognition to the parliamentary work that is done outside the chamber in the belief that work done outside when brought into this chamber by way of report is worthy of more debate than we currently give ourselves at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> As most members of this House will know, substantial work is done outside the chamber by way of committee. Enormous hours are put into committee work, advancing understanding of Australia's problems, receiving views from the public, depending upon the committee on which honourable members are serving and ultimately, in the various reports that come out of these committees, putting forward policy suggestions and recommendations. Allied to that, substantial work is done through parliamentary delegations which visit by invitation, in most instances, countries overseas. The work of honourable members on delegations is promoting our country and learning from overseas experience, bringing it back home and seeing whether we can transplant that to improve circumstances domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why the House is rarely full, Mr Speaker, as you would know, but the public probably would not well understand is that members are throughout the building working on the various committees that constitute the wider parliament. In fact, if you look at the daily Notice Paper, you will see that at the back of the daily Notice Paper are listed all of the committees. There are five standing committees, 10 committees pursuant to Sessional Orders, one committee pursuant to a resolution of the House, five joint statutory committees, two joint committees and two joint standing committees. Members of this place and indeed members of the Senate are involved on a daily and weekly basis with the work of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Especially important are those committees that this House has set up in the last couple of years pursuant to Sessional Orders which deal with references referred to them by government or references that they determine themselves dealing with matters involving Aboriginal affairs; community affairs; employment, education and training; environment, recreation and the arts; finance and public administration; industry, science and technology; legal and constitutional affairs; and transport, communications and infrastructure. The basic view of the members of the Procedure Committee is that the work of those committees, when it comes into this chamber by way of report, deserves far greater consideration than we are giving at the movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also worth noting that much of the work is rooted in bipartisan support. Public focus on politics is on the adversarial nature of debate from time to time in this chamber. Much substantive work is done where members of both the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties from this chamber work in the interests of the country in trying to come to grips with the many problems that beset us from time to time, work out solutions and bring forward recommendations that hopefully will be picked up by the Government of the day. The bottom line is that this work, rather than being consigned to a dusty shelf somewhere, deserves far greater attention in this place by way of debate on behalf of those members who served on the committee or indeed those members who may not have been on the committee but are interested in that particular area of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that the House meet at 9.30 a.m. on each sitting Thursday-that is, a sitting Thursday like today. Following the presentation of petitions, which we have just had read out by the Clerk, there will be presentation of and statements on reports of parliamentary committees and delegations which will take precedence until 10 a.m.. If these recommendations are picked up after 10 a.m., the resumption of debate on motions moved in relation to committee and delegation reports presented previously-that is, the previous sitting Thursday-will take precedence from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m.. Effectively, that will mean an hour of debate on committee reports. We will have to sit a little earlier and start at 9.30 a.m. You, Mr Speaker, and other members may have to get up a little earlier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can see that, and you will not have any problem with your alarm clock, Mr Speaker. I am an early riser and I know that most of my colleagues are certainly in the building between 8 and 8.30 a.m.. For the House to sit at 9.30 a.m. would not seem to be a great hardship at all, especially when that earlier sitting of the Parliament, if this recommendation is adopted, will mean an hour of debate on committee reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a further recommendation that if there are no reports for presentation or if presentation of and statements on the reports conclude prior to 10 a.m. after the presentation of petitions, then debate would be resumed. So in fact we may get more than an hour. If the petitions take 10 or 20 minutes and there is no particular report to be presented on that sitting Thursday, then debate can take place earlier than 10 o'clock. We have recommended that the Selection Committee determine the order of precedence and allot times for debate on committees. I think that is a very proper role for the Selection Committee to add to the work that it currently does. </PARA>
<PARA> We further recommend that the Selection Committee should give precedence to committee reports as opposed to reports from overseas delegations, and we recommend that the time of presentation of parliamentary and delegation reports on the last two sitting Thursdays of the sitting period may, subject to determination by that same Selection Committee, be extended beyond 10 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA> So the recommendations cover both eventualities. If there are no reports to be presented or if the presentation of those reports can be done in a time before 10 a.m., there will be greater debate. But we also recognise that, as we move to the end of a parliamentary session, there may be a backlog of committee reports and delegation reports that need to be presented before a sitting session finishes. This recommendation allows that presentation to go beyond 10 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 4 of our Committee report, we have produced a table. I will not ask for it to be incorporated in Hansard because I will refer to it now. Basically, the table shows the track record to date. In 1988, of the 24 reports of standing and select committees presented, only eight had motions moved in relation to them. In 1989, proportionately, the situation got worse. There were 35 committee reports presented, and there were only substantive motions on nine of them. Of the 17 motions moved during these two years, debate was resumed on only seven of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Therein lies the problem. An enormous amount of work is taking place outside the Parliament. An enormous amount of work is being done by members of this chamber in the range of parliamentary committees listed in the Notice Paper. There is an enormous amount of consultation taking place with the public in terms of receiving its advice. An enormous amount of work is being done by the support staff of the various committees producing, I would say in most instances, very worthwhile reports. When they are presented to this chamber, in the majority of cases that is the end of the story. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, if we are going to increase the respect that the public has for this chamber and if we are going to increase the respect that we ourselves have for it and for the way in which we conduct ourselves, we must improve this situation. We believe that it can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> These recommendations are not earth-shattering. They are not revolutionary. They are very modest. We are simply urging that on sitting Thursdays when there is not the precedence of Government legislation in the mornings, we start at 9.30 a.m. and that from 9.30 a.m.-after petitions-until 11 a.m. there is precedence for the presentation of committee reports and delegation reports and, thereafter, substantive debate on those reports that have been presented the previous Thursday. This will give more members of parliament the opportunity to debate substantive work done by way of parliamentary committees. I think that it is a very positive step forward in terms of improving the way in which we conduct ourselves and business on behalf of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, this Committee report has unanimous support. The Procedures Committee, like all of the committees of this House, is made up of members of all parties. We all support the report. The Chairman of the Committee introduced it a couple of weeks ago and this debate follows that presentation. I simply say to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and to the Government in general that the Procedure Committee hopes that these recommendations will be picked up without delay. I say to the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), and to the Opposition in general that the Committee hopes that they will support these recommendations without delay so that, certainly by the sittings of 1991, we can improve the way in which we conduct business on a sitting Thursday by giving ourselves more time to devote to and to debate committee reports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing us to have this arrangement this morning. If I might follow on from the remarks of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack)-the report on debate on parliamentary committee reports by the Procedure Committee is important, as he outlined in remarks to the House. Could I say to honourable members that private members' Thursday has been only of recent duration. In the past we did not have a private members' business Thursday in the way it is currently structured. We did have a grievance debate, but we did not have this more full blown, private members' day. I think it indicates that at the time when we moved to this, there was a willingness by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Government to say, `Look, we ought to try to redress the imbalance in the Parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I see this further recommendation as an extension of that process. I might say that I think we should reinforce that willingness of the Leader of the House and the Government by saying that so far this private members' business has worked well and that what we are trying to do is to finetune it in some way. As the honourable member for Tangney has correctly said, what we have seen already is that a lot of work goes into committee reports and there is a lot of substantial contact with the community. We are recognising in this report that this is the role that we should give this Parliament on Thursdays and we need to extend that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite sensibly, as the honourable member said, because committee reports by their nature tend to be bipartisan when they reach this chamber, there is not a great deal of difficulty in extending time on a Thursday morning. It is not as if other matters are going to be swept to one side. It is possible, as it is now, for this chamber to be proceeding while other activities are going on around the Parliament, and they are not in conflict. We are acting in many senses as backbenchers on a Thursday. If that is the way it is conducted, there is no reason why an extension of time, as is recommended by the Committee, cannot easily be accommodated. What it does enable us to do as members of parliament is to get in here and to talk with one another about the matters that we see as being significant. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the next point. It seems that we need to look at this Thursday in a strategic sense. In referring to the old building, people have described it as a more intimate building. There is no doubt that communication was easier in the old building. In this building, communication is more difficult even though the technology is more sophisticated-direct communication is more difficult. Because of the plan of this building, there is a sense that the executive wing is somewhat removed from the parliamentary elements of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that we give a proper time to backbenchers to make a contribution in this place, because that is what the electorate expects of them and we should give them an opportunity to do that. If that is the way that this Parliament ought to be running at some time, it is appropriate that we allocate time to it. As I said at the outset, the move to having more private members' business on a Thursday is a good one. What we are seeking here really is an extension of it. But we are doing one other thing: we are saying that this is not just a free-for-all; this is not allowing members to come in here and talk about anything that comes into their heads. We are talking about a report that has been put down in the Parliament and in which a number of people have spent a number of hours focusing upon matters of public concern. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), would recognise that the Beddall report was one such report. </PARA>
<PARA> When one goes around the community, one finds that people are interested in the reports of Parliament. What we will be doing is focusing our attention on some specific matter of concern to the Parliament and to the people of Australia. I think that is a very good role for Parliament. In the way in which Parliament tends to work we do need to have this arena as a prime focus. Let me draw this image if I might: it is true that in the last election there was an expression of view by the electorate about independents and independent members, and in fact we have one in the Parliament. What that shows is that the electorate at the current time is thinking of the role of the individual member of Parliament. If that is the case, we ought to be facilitating that role. I believe private members' Thursday does facilitate that role and certainly, as I said at the outset, the move to have this was an excellent move. What we are doing now is finetuning it. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to this other question, and the honourable member for Tangney has picked up some points which I want to echo as well. We really have to look at the way we conduct proceedings in this Parliament in many respects. This report says that we have a problem with a backlog of committee reports towards the end of a sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> A long time concern that I have had about this Parliament is that towards the end of a session we tend always to have management by crisis. In other words, there is a rush of legislation and there is a rush of committee reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Out in the commercial world at this stage people in Coles Myer Ltd know that there will be a Christmas rush, and they plan for it. The thing that staggers me is that at this stage we behave in this Parliament as if no such rush will ever occur. It happens every year. Honourable members can talk to members of parliament going back 30 years or 40 years; they will always say that at the end of the session there is a rush. What I find absolutely incomprehensible is that if we know it is going to happen why do we never plan for it. Why do we manage by crisis?</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a question of who is in government at the time. We can draw an equally bleak picture no matter who is in power. For the backbencher it suggests something about the competence of management of the Parliament. If we always have to manage as though somehow we did not realise the Christmas rush is going to come, and all of a sudden it is upon us, we have to say we are not managing the place very well. That has been true of governments over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is that in that context the role of the parliamentarian and the role of Parliament suffers-and it does suffer considerably. When I talked to colleagues from eastern Europe in the old days they would say, `We have got a parliament. You can tell we have a parliament because we are all sitting there'. I would say, `The thing that always worried me was that when the vote was taken all the hands went up together'. That is not a real parliament. A parliament is where, by definition, not all the hands go up together, where in some sense there is a question of some debate, some disagreement, some controversy. If that is what parliament is-a place for debating ideas and putting them through-what we have here on Thursdays is a very important part of our business. It gives us as backbenchers an opportunity to make a contribution. This report says that we recognise that and that now we have to do some finetuning. </PARA>
<PARA> In commending the report to the Parliament and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), I would say that what has happened so far has been an excellent advance and that when we meet in the Selection Committee we are able to see how we can give opportunity to people. We have an independent member now who, in the absence of private members' business, would have had great difficulty in getting that focus. Private members' business gives him that chance and gives all of us a chance. We recognise that there is a role to be played-and we can finetune it-particularly in relation to committee reports, in which a lot of work goes in and there is a lot of deliberate consideration and contact with the community, as the honourable member for Tangney well picked up. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to give focus to this. The Procedure Committee is not making a radical recommendation but suggesting that we improve upon the existing system and finetune it. I am sure that my colleagues who will follow in the debate will be able to add further remarks that would commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, I am very happy to associate myself with its first report for the new Parliament. The Committee has been working through a number of the procedures of this House; it will be making a series of reports on some of the procedures and traditions of this House and looking at ways in which the Parliament can improve its effectiveness. It is without question that these days the committee system is playing an increasing role in the parliamentary process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members devote a great deal of their time to being involved in the committee deliberations, attending public hearings and being involved in the other research processes that are associated with the preparation of committee reports. It involves a considerable commitment of resources, not only on the part of members but also in relation to the costs associated with meetings and the availability of the resources of the Parliament, particularly the support staff, who are providing a great deal of the background information and organisation associated with the many committees that are such a traditional part now of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> These committees play a role in addition to the reports that they present to the house. They provide a very important function in briefing members on issues that are of importance in the community, helping us to come to grips with the sorts of things that people are saying on topical issues right around the community and focusing debate and attention on matters that require a resolution within the community. They contribute greatly towards better informing members of this House. In my own brief experience I have learned a great deal by participating in public hearings in various parts of the country-not just on the issues that were under inquiry but in relation to the various ways in which Australians from all parts of our country are viewing the issues of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> These committees have produced many reports. One of the previous speakers referred to the table that is included in the Committee report. It is certainly interesting to note that there were 24 committee reports in 1988 and 35 in 1989, but only seven of those reports ever reached the stage where they were the subject of significant debate in the House. Many of these reports were of very great quality indeed and included a great many recommendations of considerable substance. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee system is an excellent way to achieve reform in this nation in a non-combative and harmonious nature. As other speakers have mentioned, the vast majority of these reports contain unanimous recommendations, and there is no significant dissent. The fact that people from all parties have been able to work together to achieve a united view on the report suggests that there is considerable community support for the kind of recommendations that come forward. So often, those recommendations are not dealt with because no adequate time is made available for parliamentary debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that only seven out of 59 reports were debated in the past two years suggests that a lot of good work, a lot of hours of work, a lot of well thought out recommendations eventually went no further and were not able to be introduced into the policies and the reform processes of the nation. I guess many of the reports were not even read or considered by many members of parliament. Regrettably, all the hours of work did not result in substantive change where that was recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Government eventually responds to all of these reports and endeavours to respond rapidly, but quite often the responses are delayed to such an extent that the issues are left behind. It is essential that the Parliament plays a role in ensuring that the work of its committees is adequately recognised in the government process. They are, after all, committees of the Parliament. The reports belong to the Parliament. We need to make time available in the Parliament so that they are able to be debated and the recommendations pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is increasing awareness amongst members of parliament of the important role of the committee structure. Therefore, it is essential that the Parliament recognises that role and devotes the necessary time to ensure that the processes are carried through. I know that time in this House is at a premium and it is for that reason that the Committee has recommended an earlier start on Thursday mornings. We are being told that next week we can expect to sit until after midnight every night, so for the House to commence at 9.30 in the morning seems to be a fairly small price to pay to ensure that additional time is made available during the day on which private members' business is dealt with, so that the committee structure is given a proper role in the proceedings of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> As the previous speaker said, it is most unfortunate that we have the Christmas log jam of Bills and, to some extent, of reports. We need to develop procedures to ensure that those reports which are presented during that time are not lost in the log jam, but are given fair recognition. The report addresses that issue and comes up with very creditable solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to hear Mr Speaker respond this morning to our final recommendation. He very quickly introduced the final recommendation in relation to listings in the Notice Paper. I hope that the Government will respond just as quickly to the other recommendations included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I compliment the Chairman of the Committee and all those who have been associated with the preparation of this initial report. It enjoys the unanimous support of the Committee and has real potential to upgrade further the committee system of this Parliament and to ensure that the recommendations and the work of the committees are given adequate recognition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given the time, I will be brief. First, I entirely support the steps that are being developed here. I commend the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure and the work of that Committee. It seems to be very practical. I wish to pick up one of the remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). It is true that government is not always prompt with its responses to committee reports. I simply note that the first committee with which I was involved was the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The response is still not available to a report that Committee conducted in the last Parliament on takeovers, monopolies and mergers. That is a lively issue which has recently attracted the attention of the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. Obviously, when that is the case members of parliament legitimately have concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend two points for the Committee's future attention, apart from those measures that it has already adopted. Firstly, there should be an opportunity for debate once the Government delivers its response to these reports. Not only are the reports intrinsically worth debating but so too are the Government's responses. In many ways it is more important for members of this House to have the opportunity to discuss the Government's responses to reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, when the Government does not bring in its response within the agreed timeframe, which I understand has now been reduced to six months, there should be a future opportunity for relisting that matter so that the issues, if they are still thought appropriate for debate within the House-the Selection Committee would obviously have to measure this carefully-and if there is a significant impetus for debate from members of the Parliament, are not let slide because the Executive has not responded to the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not mention these matters in order to criticise in any way any Minister or Ministers. I think we could all identify particular reports that have not been responded to within the agreed six months. I think this identifies an issue which the Standing Committee on Procedure would do well to look to for future debate. I welcome these initiatives and I hope that the House supports them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been indicated by previous speakers, this report and its recommendations have the wholehearted agreement of the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) just about said it all. There is little that needs to be added to his outline of what is involved and some of the thinking behind the recommendations. It is a serious attempt to afford the opportunity to all members of the House, I presume, but certainly to backbenchers in particular, to contribute views and to discuss the reports not only of committees on which they may sit, but also the reports of other committees. That opportunity does not exist at the moment, or to the extent that it does it is extremely limited. That is a lack which we have experienced for some time now. It may be one of the reasons why many committee reports are simply not read.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we do not have to address our minds to the findings of a committee there is plenty else that might be done-and is done-in this place. Murphy's law, Parkinson's law, or whatever it is, will apply and members will go off and fill in the available time on other worthwhile work. The Committee is saying, in effect, that the reports of other committees which are tabled in this place are important and in many cases are far more important than the other activities which members might undertake from time to time. That is a matter of judgment for each member. I doubt whether there is a member in the place who would not, at one time or another, welcome the opportunity to discuss a report which has been tabled in this place. In large part the opportunity has simply not been available for him or her to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we could also say that the recommendation to extend the sitting hours by half an hour each sitting Thursday is little enough. It is a very small contribution to the work of this House. In fact, in a year when we will sit fewer days and fewer hours in the House of Representatives than ever before in the history of Federation, except for one year in the 1930s, we should perhaps address our minds to the time that is available to debate the whole program of this Parliament. We see that today 15 Bills are to be introduced into this place. Most if not all of them are expected to be dealt with by the House-under the guillotine, no doubt-sooner or later. We saw a similar number of Bills introduced only yesterday, and probably more are on the way. So when we talk about an additional half hour, we are accommodating the governing Party and not the wishes of the Opposition. We are able to be unanimous to the extent that we support the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply put it to the House that this Parliament, this year certainly but as a general rule, simply does not sit long enough. I am talking about not sitting hours but sitting days. If we sat a sufficient number of days to conduct, in a civilised and constructive way, the business of the Parliament, we would not have to be even thinking about extending the sitting hours each Thursday by half of one hour. It is the way the Executive determines the conduct of business in this place which has brought about the need for this report and these recommendations, and that is probably where we should look for solutions. If the Executive is not going to regard the Parliament as the supreme debating forum, we will see more and more of the decision taking made outside this Parliament or, at best, by our colleagues in the Senate, who at least insist upon the opportunity to examine legislation and debate issues in a way which we cannot emulate in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the recommendations contained in the report which, if accepted, will give more time for the presentation of reports. It will also permit greater flexibility in the presentation of reports. It is rather strange to stand in this House and be the sixth speaker in a debate in which there has been not just lukewarm support but strong support from all speakers. As backbench members, we do realise that the time we have to speak on reports is small.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like all honourable members in this place, I have served on several committees. As other speakers in this debate have said, the amount of work that people put into committee work is often quite staggering, as indeed is also the diversity of the topics that are covered. There can be nothing more frustrating at the time a report is tabled for the chairman and deputy chairman of a committee to get 10 minutes each to speak and one or two other members to get five minutes, when one may have put 12 months work into helping to compile that committee report. So I think the recommendations are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, at the moment the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is undertaking an investigation into Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea. It would horrify me, given the work that I and others have personally put in, and I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member of the Committee, have put in if we were either left off the speakers list because we did not fit into the five minutes, or indeed we were limited to five minutes with our contribution. This is often the problem when one comes to table these reports; the opportunity is not there to develop them or to share one's insights with the Parliament and one's colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Committee work is important to this House because of the diverse range of topics committees investigate. It is also important because it is one of the few opportunities for members of the general public to come before a parliamentary committee to put their point of view. That is a very important aspect. From that involvement with committee work we learn a tremendous lot. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is a great pity for these committees to be restricted. I welcome this amendment very much. I think it will enhance the importance of committee work in this Parliament and will lead to a better and more informed parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill proposes to amend section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which deals with offences in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. As currently framed, the section contains subparagraph (1) (d) (ii), which provides that a person shall not, by writing or speech, use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. To contravene this subparagraph is an offence punishable, upon conviction, by penalty of (a) in the case of a natural person $500 or imprisonment for six months or both, and (b) in the case of a body corporate, $1,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is my contention that this provision is a clear denial of the inalienable right to free speech in a democratic society. This Bill aims to effect the removal of the provision from the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed by my learned colleagues who are members of the legal profession that the word `calculated' in essence means `likely'. In the context of the related clause then one could read that clause as saying `by writing or speech use words likely to bring a member of the Commission into disrepute'. It is my view that such a statement, such a provision, gives the Industrial Relations Commission a measure of protection not given to a court of law, or to Parliament or to a member of the wider public-in fact a freedom or protection from even the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were so then one might say or write in the press that a member of the Commission is a terrible tennis player, which might be true, but such a statement might well be likely to bring the commissioner into disrepute. In such a circumstance a journalist writing that a member of the Commission is a terrible tennis player in fact makes himself or herself liable, under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, to prosecution. It might logically be argued that if the offending clause gives the Commission a form of protection not given to others then this clause is beyond the powers available to the Commonwealth under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> In moving this amendment to the Act I gave due consideration to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report No. 35 on contempt, presented on 3 June 1987. That report suggested section 299 (1) (d) (ii) be replaced with other words which would give the Commission and Commissioners a form of protection against defamation and slander less onerous than the offending clause. On balance, I have concluded that the members of the Commission are given adequate protection through right of defamation action in common law. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that the Industrial Relations Commission-and the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in earlier times-has been highly selective in using this section of the Act. Honourable members might well recall that Mr H.R. Nicholls, the editor of the Hobart Mercury, was the first recipient of the Arbitration Court's arbitrary and selective use of section 299 (1) (d) (ii), as it appeared in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of that time, in seeking to have Mr Nicholls charged with contempt in 1911. I am unable to determine the exact number of cases of similar nature but I would believe that all honourable members would be aware of action commenced, on request of the Commission, in 1989 and continued this year under section 299 (1) (d) (ii) of the Act against Nationwide News, publisher of the Australian, and Mr Chris Gorrick, Federal Vice President of the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia. The fact that the case is being heard by the High Court should not deter us in this Parliament from remedying what is clearly an inequitable and undemocratic Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Press Council has described application of the section as having `a potentially chilling effect on the freedom of speech' and has said that it is concerned at the very wide scope of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are among the most basic guarantees in a free democratic society. We must all accept our responsibilities in this place as legislators to ensure that we do not-even unintentionally-challenge, demean, or degrade those basic rights. If we have a bad law, and I believe this is such a law, then it is incumbent on us to remove it. </PARA>

<PARA> We presented the amendments in the form of a draft Bill in order to seek comment and discussion so that, in the final examination, all views could be taken into account. We received a gratifying response to our proposed amendments-over 400 submissions and telephone calls-and I addressed interest groups in all the mainland States. Proper consultation was effected. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposes amendments to the Disability Services Act to provide for the tabling in Parliament of principles, objectives and guidelines for debate, amendment if necessary, and approval. In his second reading speech during the debate on the Disability Services Act back in 1986 Senator Grimes said that these principles, objectives and guidelines would be tabled. They have not yet been laid before Parliament. Bringing these principles, objectives and guidelines before Parliament will provide greater assurance of adequate opportunity for proper debate on such vital matters which could alter the thrust of the Act and/or its implementation. It will also provide opportunity for public participation, input, criticism and awareness, and will curtail any proliferation by the Department of supposed guidelines which have up until now created uncertainty, rigidity and confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> We have again included three new service types to be approved for funding under section 9 of the Act: attendant care services, staff training services and vocational training services. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention here that the coalition is committed to the improvement of the quality of life for all Australians who have a disability, and we believe that wherever possible this should be achieved by providing services which are within the mainstream of the community. However, we are opposed to ideology overtaking commonsense, and hence we support the provision of specialist services where such services are obviously appropriate to the needs and free choice of the client group and valued both by that client group and by the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> We support evaluation by consumer outcomes and we have been concerned that so much of the debate over the last two years has concentrated on process and models rather than outcomes. We make no apology for the fact that we support the continuation of the best of existing nursing homes, hostels, sheltered workshops and activity therapy centres where such services provide the best practical lifestyle for particular clients. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there should be a happy co-existence of the old and new services beyond 1992, but acknowledge that as more and more new services are established and more and more young clients with different aspirations and expectations seek services the old services will naturally contract. Extension of the transition date of 1992 has obviously become necessary, especially as the Department appears to be admitting that the deadline of 1992 cannot be met. We propose to extend the deadline to 1995 with the intention that we would still keep pressure on those service providers who can change their services to enable people with a disability to achieve their total fulfilment under the Act to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also contains measures to provide some degree of predictability in financial assistance, and some degree of restriction as to the terms and conditions which may be imposed by the Minister in approving the making of a grant for financial assistance. As a result of these amendments it will no longer be possible for the Department-with or without the sanction of the Minister-to press upon recipients of grants unilateral, harsh or unwarranted terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill provides for an appeals procedure, in order that the decisions of the Minister and his Department may be reviewed. Such a mechanism is included in most other legislation of a similar nature and we believe that its non-inclusion in the Disability Services Act was an oversight on the part of the then Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are concerned with accountability and we believe that it was evidently in the mind of the then Minister, Senator Grimes, that amendments would be necessary. Indeed, it is a sad reflection on the Government that, despite knowledge of our intentions for some 11 months, it has not moved to amend the Act to provide for both departmental and ministerial accountability.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Constitution Alteration (Making of Laws on the Initiative of the Electors) Bill 1990 is the second of two Bills I have now introduced to the House which provide for referendums to be initiated by the electors of Australia. The first Bill related to proposals to alter the Australian Constitution. The present Bill would allow public initiation of a proposal to enact an ordinary law of the Commonwealth, generally known as the `direct legislative initiative'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under our Constitution the enactment of legislation is the exclusive preserve of parliament, but there is no principle to preclude legislative power being shared with the electors. In fact, our Constitution recognises the sovereignty of the people, as opposed to the sovereignty of parliament, so that, in a sense, this Bill is enabling legislation which is 90 years overdue. Laws made on the initiative of the electors would not be able to be repealed or amended by parliament unless the law so made provided that power. An exception is made to cover special circumstances where the need to repeal or amend some provision is unarguably a matter of vital national interest. In this case the Bill sets out clearly the steps that must be taken. A two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament is required and the question is subject to court review to ensure that this emergency power is not abused. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that it is the objects of the elector-made law which are made secure from amendment or appeal-except with the approval of the electors-rather than just the text of the statute. This allows some flexibility in the framing of subsequent related enactments. It requires that an elector-made law must contain a statement of what the law seeks to achieve. Recognising the pace of change, elector-made laws would be subject to a 10-year sunset provision. Unless the law is reaffirmed by an automatic referendum held at the first general election after it has been in effect for 10 years, it would cease to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also provides for the application of the principle known as Robson rotation to ballot papers where there is more than one question. This would ensure that there is no advantage to be derived from a position on the ballot paper and discourage reliance on how-to-vote cards. </PARA>
<PARA> In other respects the Bill is broadly the same as my first Bill which provided for proposed constitutional alterations. Both Bills provide that a group of electors may initiate a petition for presentation to either House of Parliament. The choice is given to the proponents under both Bills of proposing a fully drafted law or a brief statement of purpose. In the latter case, the implementing measure is to be drafted in complete terms by the Government if carried at referendum. The relevant House and the courts are given a role in overseeing the process to ensure that impracticable or confusing proposals are either perfected before being put to referendum or else struck down. Both Bills provide a six-month signature gathering period and set a minimum requirement of 3 per cent of electors and 3 per cent in each of a majority of States to sign. The initiated referendums would be held at the same time as a general election. For a referendum to be carried the approval of a majority of the electors and a majority in each of a majority of the States is required. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, many other aspects of the process that require consideration, such as funding disclosure, limits on campaign spending, presentation of for and against arguments by an objective authority and other matters. These raise many of the same issues as would arise in the course of an ordinary election campaign and can be covered by further legislation or amendment of existing electoral laws. The Bills provide power to Parliament to enact such laws as may be required. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of both Bills, alterations to the Constitution would be required and the electors would have to approve both of them at referendum before they could be enacted. I suggest that any government that subscribes to basic democratic principles ought to be willing to let the electors decide whether they should have these powers by putting the questions to them. I am quite confident that the public is of the view that government is too important to be left solely to politicians. </PARA>

<PARA> That, recognising (a) the crucial role of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) in promoting Australia as a multicultural society and (b) the excellent work of the SBS in producing and transmitting high quality programs to the community in a variety of languages, this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) congratulates the Government on its decision to establish the SBS as a statutory organisation with its own charter; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) calls on the Government to bring forward legislation to give effect to that commitment as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) recently celebrated the tenth anniversary of its television service. It was launched on 24 October 1980-United Nations Day-in Melbourne and Sydney. Over the last 10 years the service has expanded to a present total of 36 transmitters covering capital cities, regional areas and towns across Australia. It has really been a remarkable achievement for a service which has come under attack from various quarters from time to time, but which nevertheless has continued to try to provide for Australians an excellent service in terms of the promotion in Australian homes through SBS television, firstly, of a more global and international view of the world and, secondly, an excellent service for Australia's multicultural community by providing radio programs in many languages. Indeed, I think the biggest achievement of SBS has been that it has allowed all Australians to gain a broader view of the total world community. The slogan `Bringing the World back Home' truly has a lot to commend it in terms of the achievements of the SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the SBS we as a society have been enriched by the experiences of the world in terms of cultural, political and social diversity. We have also been given the opportunity to better understand the cultural diversity and multicultural nature of our own Australian society. In many programs, films and documentaries the SBS has enabled the Australian viewing public to learn about life and people in every continent of the world. This window to the world has brought about an awareness which has led and will continue to lead to Australia becoming a more tolerant and learned society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that before the SBS began, television programs in this country were narrowly focused. The understanding of Australians about the world in general was much narrower. The SBS world news, which has been seen to be one of the major television programs, has been able to bring news from all over the globe and has had a dramatic impact. Perhaps I should quote Brian Johns, the head of the SBS, on this very point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Look at the SBS news coverage, and then tell me that it is the product of a ghetto. I think you'll find that media analysts will agree that SBS has had a perceptible impact in making other networks here more conscientious about the breadth and diversity of their news services. In other words SBS is having an impact not only on its own audiences, but on the industry itself.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that since the SBS world news and other programs focused on the world started, both the news and current affairs programs of all other television stations have focused on the international or world perspective. That has been only to the good of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of the SBS has been that it has made Australians more aware of the multicultural nature of their society. It has produced excellent programs which have brought to the attention of all Australians the various customs, beliefs and traditions of many of the cultural groups that compose Australian society. Some of those programs have also provided us with the first opportunity to have an insight into the talents and achievements of people from the various ethnic communities. We have been able to understand some of the different multicultural arts, some of the arts of the various ethnic communities and some of their festivals and traditions in a way that has never been possible before. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that although we had massive immigration to this country in the 1950s and 1960s, it was only with the establishment and success of the SBS that most Australians were able to understand or at least get some glimpse of this richness. It is somewhat sad that the other television channels have not yet taken up the challenge of multiculturalism and reflected more of the multicultural nature of Australia in their programming. It is starting to happen, but it is still a very slow process and it is one that needs to be speeded up if we are to really understand the nature of the concrete reality which is the Australian multicultural society at this moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to actually presenting the nature of our multicultural society, the SBS has not tried to hide away some of the problems concerning conflicts within and between cultural groups. It has not tried to ignore or sweep under the carpet some of the problems arising from our immigration program and our multicultural policies. Nor has it failed to present the views of those who are against multiculturalism or against our current immigration policies. It is true to say that the news and current affairs programs of the SBS have been very balanced. Indeed, the service has gone out of its way to present an objective picture of debates on immigration, multiculturalism and other such issues. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most exciting aspects-something that I was concerned about years ago-has been the lack of opportunities for people from other ethnic backgrounds to produce radio and television programs and to participate in the creative arts in our society. The SBS has given such opportunities to young film makers from all backgrounds, including ethnic backgrounds, to produce and participate in the production of a number of programs that have shown us a different perspective on Australian society from the dominant one that we get from the other television stations and channels. </PARA>
<PARA> In overall terms, I think that the SBS has been a great success as a cultural phenomenon in this country. It is interesting that some of the initial sceptics of the SBS-for example, some people who lived in the country and did not actually know much about it-are now calling for a further extension of the SBS service. When I go to various places around Australia I am asked whether I can make representations to the appropriate Minister to get SBS to that region because the local people cannot get SBS coverage. It is true to say that everyone in Australia would now like to be able to receive SBS programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, not everyone is able to get the SBS because not everyone has access to the ultra high frequency system. Because of that it is very important, when assessing the ratings of the SBS, to look at the percentage of those people who actually have television sets and have access to the SBS service. That is not done often. For example, the McNair Anderson ratings do not take into account the proportion of people who can actually get the SBS. When that is done, however, one can see that the coverage of the SBS is much higher than the McNair Anderson results suggest. In fact, even on the McNair Anderson assessment, one and a half million people watch the SBS every week. If the phenomenon that I referred to is taken into account and allied with other measurements which indicate that the McNair Anderson surveys underestimate the SBS coverage, one can get the very firm estimate that 2.7 million Australians watch the SBS every week. That figure was the result of a survey carried out through Newspoll for the SBS. It is a very significant figure indeed and it indicates a very big increase from previous years. Clearly the SBS is becoming more popular, more acceptable to Australians and is a really great achievement from that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> One also needs to say something about SBS radio because the wonderful role it plays in conveying information in many languages about our society to those people whose English is insufficient is not often mentioned. Not only does it convey information to older Australians of an ethnic background who may not have sufficient English-information about our society, politics, economics, sport, and culture-but it also performs a very important role in that the second generation of people from those ethnic backgrounds are able to listen to programs and continue to understand and learn more of their parents' native language. That is important in the continuation of our linguistic skills in Australia. We have debated in this place the importance for Australians to retain and extend their second language skills and there is no doubt that the role of the SBS is enormous in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that many people of Anglo-Saxon background who want to learn or are learning other languages watch programs on SBS television and follow the subtitles in order to check their translations. In this way, they are actually learning a lot about that second language. There is no doubt about the contribution of SBS in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say two things. I congratulate the Government on its initiative in determining that SBS should be a statutory corporation with its own charter. That was a very important philosophical decision in principle and a very firm commitment made by the Government to many millions of Australians who support SBS. I call upon the Government to bring forward that legislation as soon as is possible so that SBS can continue to go from strength to strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to congratulate everyone involved with SBS on 10 years of success and to wish them even higher things in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that it is most appropriate that you of all people, Mr Deputy Speaker, should be in the chair today as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) brings forward this motion. As Liberal Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, you had more to do with the initiative of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) than any other person. The prime initiative came, of course, from Malcolm Fraser himself. The honourable member for Calwell just failed to acknowledge where the initiative, the drive and the concept came from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the Labor Party came to office, it has tried to cut, change and kill SBS television and broadcasting services. The honourable member should acknowledge that. There have been cutbacks and mergers with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) instead of allowing SBS to continue as a separate organisation. It has been made impossible for anybody to receive the service by tipping it onto the UHF band where nobody can get to it. People had to buy special aerials. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion the honourable member for Calwell has moved today is fascinating because, in fact, it has been the policy of the Opposition for some six or seven years that SBS should be a separate entity. Suddenly, the Government has decided that it is going to put the policy that we have had for so long into action. But it is wrong of the previous speaker not to pay tribute to those who had the thoughts, the ideas, the courage and the conviction. Frank Galbally initiated it, Malcolm Fraser put it into action, and the Deputy Speaker who has just left the chair followed up this action. I do not know how a person who claims to be an authority on multiculturalism can have so little factual and historical knowledge about the establishment of this fine broadcasting service. </PARA>
<PARA> The radio and television services provided by SBS are very cost effective. When Senator Walsh wanted to bury this organisation a couple of years ago as part of a Budget round, the cost effectiveness of SBS and the small outlay to government for the breadth and depth of services was one of the features that finally convinced the Ministers and the Government of the day to keep the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC was given, by both the Whitlam Government and the Fraser Government, opportunities to broaden its programs to cover a range of affairs that would be of interest to all Australians, particularly those who had come from overseas. The ABC failed to take up that challenge. It was offered that challenge on a number of occasions, but walked away from it. So it was essential then to establish SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I express my disappointment with the Australian Labor Party's attitude to this organisation. There have been some small extensions to the service, but really the Government has done nothing. All it has done is threaten its existence from the time it was elected. It has done nothing positive. There have been no ideas or initiatives. There should be new initiatives and thinking. There needs to be a development and advancement of this broadcasting service and of the people whose talents are known to all Australians. Where would Australia be without George Donikian? He is known across the length and breadth of this nation. There are many others of that calibre who started their careers in SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> The value to all Australians of SBS is recognised, but part of the trouble with the Australian Labor Party is that multiculturalism has really become the captive of the socialist left in Victoria. It is running its own agenda on what it thinks multiculturalism is. The Australian Labor Party tends to steer away from that proposition and does not know what to do with something like SBS. It could not be straightforward and say, `We appreciate the contribution of people who have come from overseas. We want all Australians to understand the culture, history and family background of these people. We think of it as being valuable for Australia, being so isolated in a geographical sense, to be able to identify with any and every part of the world'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the view of this side of the House. We believe in that sort of thing. The Australian Labor Party has great difficulty in coping with this because it has a small bunch of people running their own agenda. Basically, the rest of its members are decent blokes, but they are really stuck on how to handle SBS. We on this side are not afraid of SBS. We think it is healthy and good. We initiated it and we support it. In fact, it was our idea, as I have said, to corporatise SBS and to allow it to have its own separate commission and organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The encouragement of tolerance, knowledge and understanding are critical in our community at the moment. I believe that the community's tolerance, knowledge and understanding of people from all parts of the world and from different circumstances is really being tested. The appreciation that we need to engender in all Australians is very significant. It can be best done by the services offered by SBS. </PARA>
<PARA> SBS offers two distinct types of services: television and radio. I believe that the radio programs are a critical survival link for people who are not skilled in the English language. They serve a unique and very special purpose. I hope that no government contemplates fiddling around with that radio service. It is a link. It is a verbal newspaper. It is a means of communicating with and understanding Australian society. Also the services of voluntary and government groups are a critical survival link for communities. The establishment of the radio programs has been an excellent and very successful initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the television programs have become somewhat different over the years. Fewer Australian made films are being shown on SBS. It tends to be a foreign film program. The news services and many of the programs on SBS television are excellent, but the Government should create a sufficiently fluid situation to allow change over a period. I hope that the darlings of the socialist left are not going to lock that television service in such a tight straitjacket, by means of legislation, that there will not be the creativity and opportunities that SBS needs to have. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it would be my view that to make SBS television more market responsive and better able to expand its services into the huge areas of Australia that cannot receive it-the decision to put it on UHF is only one factor affecting this; the geographic reach of SBS television is very limited-it should be privatised. By a process of privatisation SBS would really be allowed to expand and to develop a greater market orientation. This would also encourage and provide jobs and opportunities for skilled artists, directors and producers who have a particular ethnic outlook. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that that needs to be done, and I cannot see governments ever finding enough dough to be able to do it except by privatisation. I do not think that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) or the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) would ever be able to find the money in the short term that they have left in office to be able to develop SBS to what it could and should be. It is my view that the only way in which that could be done would be through the privatisation of SBS. Give it a charter and separate legislation, but then privatise it. I believe that then we would have something that would build on what Fraser first established. It would be a fresh initiative, something that the imagination and intelligence of the Australian Labor Party has not been able to reach. All it has been able to do is fiddle at the margins. There have been no initiatives or fresh ideas in this area. So it will be with, I hope, an incoming coalition government that we will make another giant stride in this important area of television. </PARA>
<PARA> As we move ahead in that area, it is critical that we maintain the attributes that SBS has sought to engender in Australians, and which are appreciated by thousands and thousands of Australians. I refer to the attributes of tolerance, of knowledge of other people's lifestyles, of understanding and appreciation, of courtesy to our fellow man, of fairness and of being able to assist those of all different backgrounds. But this is not just a matter of ethnic background. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the tolerance implicit in SBS deals with things such as relationships between men and women and those who are disabled in our community-the tolerance expressed by SBS covers a broad spectrum. That needs to go on. To have separate legislation to establish it as a separate identity is fine because it has been our policy for ages, but the Government should go on to privatise it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a non-socialist left member of this House, I should like to express my great pleasure in being able to second the motion calling for the establishment of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a statutory organisation with its own charter as soon as possible. This is consistent not only with our Government's stated intentions but also with the needs of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), I do not believe that any single party can claim sole credit for the establishment of SBS and its networks. Ethnic radio stations were transmitting as a result of initiatives under the Whitlam Government. It is quite true, and I commend the Fraser Government for it, that SBS television transmissions started almost exactly 10 years ago as a result of further initiatives by the Fraser Government. But I am indeed rather surprised to have found when I looked it up that SBS television started transmitting in Adelaide only in 1985 as a result of further initiatives undertaken by the Hawke Government. I do not know how we managed without it before but it is a fact that the credit for these initiatives should be shared, and that is fine because I believe that the SBS television network is, on a dollar for dollar basis, the best of the five networks available in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to spend five minutes just praising the SBS television programming but a few points are in order. I agree with what the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) says about SBS's outstanding contribution to Australia's development as a multicultural society. I should point out that, whatever the honourable member for Mitchell says about this side of the House, none of those remarks would apply to the honourable member for Calwell in any shape or form. He has been a dedicated supporter of SBS during the 10 years of its existence and his 10 years in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> SBS television distributes programs in a wide range of cultures and languages and it also has an outstanding subtitle capacity, and honourable members might note that many of these subtitle products are sold overseas as a small contribution to our export earnings. But that is not the only dimension to SBS programming or it would be difficult to explain why 56 per cent of its 2.5 million viewers every week, as opposed to 77 per cent of the total population, are in fact born in Australia. So it is not just an ethnic audience that it reaches. Its news service has always been quite distinct from the other four, because it sources it from different overseas facilities and it has a globalist perspective and it is quite non-parochial in character, and I commend it for this. The same observations could be made about its documentary programs that are outstanding and come from quite different sources to the other four stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, its movies are distinctive. While I would be the first to concede that they vary considerably in quality, they do include some of the world's finest from cultures other than those based on the English language and from North America. Many of these movies, as the honourable member for Calwell pointed out, come from ethnic Australians who got their first start in movie making as a result of SBS sponsoring or assisting their projects. I note that the classic produced by one of my former constituents, Ms Sophia Turkiewicz, Silver City, one of the first truly ethnic Australian movies, was first sponsored and broadcast on SBS television. </PARA>
<PARA> It continues to attract my attention not just in those areas but in its book programs, movie programs, culinary programs-I am sorry to get back to restaurants, Mr Deputy Speaker-and historical series that are just not available on other stations for countries that we previously regarded as distant about which we need to know little. Indeed, it even had a series on the historiography of Wales. Indeed, SBS television broadcast the only programs in the Welsh language that I know of outside Wales and I note that 2EA is to be commended on the fact that it broadcast for 12 hours in the Welsh language in 1989. A list of the languages that it broadcasts in are contained in its annual report and run to a couple of pages and indeed are quite staggering and truly commendable. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker talked about commercialising SBS. A few of the points he made are quite salient and, while I do not agree with the perspective he has adopted, I would like to point out that SBS has utilised the American public broadcasting network funding model with some success. The World Cup was televised complete with the Legal and General Insurance sponsoring material which did not interrupt broadcasting and did not seem to interfere with viewers' pleasures. That is a model that might be further investigated if indeed it is found necessary to augment SBS funding from sources other than that of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems in retrospect that the only reason such attitudes were not adopted on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) was at the time the other commercial networks feared that it would drain their commercial sponsorship revenue dollars. I am not advocating-and I would not want people to believe that I am advocating-there should be commercial breaks on SBS television but the American public broadcasting network service system might be utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 it is quite true, as the previous speaker said, that this Government had the idea of amalgamating SBS and the ABC in order to reduce overheads costs. The outcry was very considerable, and working as a consultant for the Government at the time, I had the distinct lack of pleasure of turning up to my local united trades and labour council and being abused at great length for even suggesting that SBS and the ABC should be amalgamated. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion expresses the fact that the Government is now moving in exactly the opposite direction to establish the SBS as an independent statutory body with its own charter and the only criticism I could make of the policy was that it was not achieved on the tenth birthday of the SBS television transmissions, which occurred unfortunately last month. But a belated happy birthday to SBS and, as soon as we can make it an independent statutory corporation, the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House, pursuant to section 55 (1) (e) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, refer to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority for its examination, the question of whether there has been, and if not why not, any investigation or inquiry by the National Crime Authority or any other relevant law enforcement agency into allegations made by Mr Tom Burton in an article entitled `The murder story that won't go to press', published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the House of the first two paragraphs of that article. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>For quite some time I have been sitting on a story about a (Federal) Cabinet Minister, one of Australia's Mr Bigs of business, and what looks like a very grubby murder. </PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken to various witnesses but none, understandably, is keen to be named, let alone prepared to go to Court to testify to the veracity of their claims. Documents corroborate some of their claims, but almost all are hearsay. Unfortunately, because of Australia's defamation laws, the story remains privy to me. </PARA>
<PARA>So wrote Mr Burton in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 July. When I first read that story I thought it was quite bizarre. I thought it may have been some sort of a beat-up. That perhaps was unfair to Mr Burton because as time has gone on this Government and the authorities have done nothing. At its lowest level, the story has all the elements of Alice in Wonderland. Just imagine if X shoots Y, and Z knows of this, but the police and the responsible authorities say, `We cannot do anything unless Z wanders in and talks to us'. So they do nothing. That is the situation at its lowest level. </PARA>
<PARA> At the highest level the story has all the elements of some sort of cover-up. If in fact a responsible journalist is alleging that there has been a murder in which a Cabinet Minister has been involved-as the murderer, as an accessory to the murder or as part of a conspiracy to a murder-it is, to put it mildly, a very serious allegation. If a government believes in law enforcement, we would expect it to say to the authorities, `Have this matter investigated'. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have indicated our view on this and have wanted the matter investigated. We moved that it go to the Standing Committee on Privileges to see if it was besmirching the character of members of parliament. The Government opposed that and negated the question. At least one person on the Government side-the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes)-was sufficiently concerned about the matter to put a question on notice about this. I will come back to that at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the third time I have raised the matter in this Parliament. The first was to draw it to the attention of the Speaker and to argue a case that it raised a matter of privilege and the second was to move that it go to the Privileges Committee. I got no satisfaction on either. I have now moved this motion to have the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority examine the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore want to look at the authority which supports my view that such a committee has the power to look into this matter because I believe it is plain that it is within the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee to consider the matter. Section 55(1) (e) of the National Crime Authority Act provides that the duties of the Committee include this obligation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to inquire into any question in connection with its--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Committee's--</PARA>
<PARA>duties which is referred to it by either House of the Parliament, and to report to that House upon that question. </PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore necessary to look at the duties of the Committee, which include, inter alia, under paragraph (a) of that subsection, a duty to:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . monitor and review the performance by the Authority of its functions</PARA>
<PARA>and, under paragraph (b) of that subsection:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to report to both Houses of the Parliament, with such comments as it thinks fit, upon any matter appertaining to the Authority or connected with the performance of its functions . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of subsection 55 (1) (e), to which I have referred, require consideration of what the functions of the National Crime Authority are. Under subsection 11(1) of the National Crime Authority Act, the general functions of the Authority include, firstly, the collection of criminal information and intelligence relating to relevant criminal activities and the dissemination of that information and intelligence to law enforcement agencies and, secondly, the investigation, other than investigations pursuant to specific references given to it under sections 13 or 14, of matters relating to relevant criminal activities. The phrase `relevant criminal activity' is defined in section 4 of the Act to mean:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . any circumstances implying, or any allegations, that a relevant offence may have been, or may be being, committed against a law of the Commonwealth, of a State or of a Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is patently clear that the newspaper article in question makes allegations of this type. The phrase `relevant offence' is defined in section 4 of the Act to mean under paragraph (a) an offence that `involves 2 or more offenders and substantial planning and organization' and under paragraph (d) an offence that involves, amongst other things `violence, bribery or corruption of, or by, an officer of Commonwealth . . . or that involves matters of the same general nature as one or more of the foregoing, or that is of any other prescribed kind'. </PARA>
<PARA> The phrase `officer of the Commonwealth' is defined under section 4 to specifically include `a Minister of State of the Commonwealth'. To complete the picture, I should point out that under subsection 55 (2) the Committee cannot investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the motion does not call upon the Committee to investigate the substance of the allegations contained in Mr Burton's article but, rather, to investigate or inquire into the functions or performance of the National Crime Authority in relation to those allegations. The exact manner in which such an inquiry should be conducted will, of course, be a matter to be determined by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only members on this side of the House who seem concerned about this matter, save and except for the honourable member for Corio, who on 19 September placed a question on notice to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), question No. 276, and received what can only be described as a most unsatisfactory response from the Attorney-General, that response being dated 31 October, in which the Attorney-General simply washed his hands of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> When, on 21 August, I moved that the matter go to the Privileges Committee, I discussed the matter in some detail. I said that the words used by Mr Burton leave them open to the clear interpretation that witnesses-not just Mr Burton-claim that a Minister either committed a murder, was an accessory to a murder or was involved in a conspiracy to a murder. The response was total obstruction. The Government has been so obstructionist in this matter as to indicate but one thing: it is covering up. If it is not covering up the involvement of a Minister in a murder-or as an accessory or in a conspiracy-it is at least covering up and preventing an investigation into the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> Day after day, after journalists write articles in newspapers, Ministers come into this House proclaiming some manifest injustice has been done to the Government and set the record straight. In this arena there has been not a word, not a sound, but `No'. When the allegation was first made before the Parliament resumed, there was a lot of sound and bluster from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Attorney-General. They called on Mr Burton to give his evidence to the police. But it appears that they want the action to flow one way because at no stage has the Attorney-General requested the police to investigate the matter. One would think he would give a detailed explanation today but he is not here; he is not in the House. It happens every time. </PARA>
<PARA> When I raised the matter with the Committee of Privileges, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), in his non-communicative manner, explained that the Government would not go along with what we were doing. There are limitations on the Attorney-General to the extent that he can direct the police, and that is understood, but he is responsible for law enforcement and can request the police to investigate a matter such as this. But what was his response to the honourable member for Corio, a Labor member, who, as I said, asked the following question on notice-Question No. 276:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Have allegations by a journalist that a Cabinet minister was party to a murder been fully investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has any evidence been found which supports the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has any action been taken with respect to the allegations; if not, why not. </PARA>
<PARA>The response from the Attorney-General was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Federal Police (AFP) has advised me that it is not investigating the matter. No investigation can be made unless Mr Burton makes available the information he alleges to possess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept that, but does the honourable member think it is real life in this community, when someone makes an allegation such as this, for everyone to sit on their hands and wait for the man to trot down to the police station and hand everything over? What sort of life has the honourable member been living? What sort of law enforcement does he advocate? Does he expect the police to sit in the police station and wait for alleged criminals to call on them and have a chat? Fair go! Why does he think we make available moneys for investigations to be made? As I said about 10 minutes ago, it is Alice in Wonderland stuff. The honourable member is the epitome of a character within it if he is telling me that the police should not even go out and talk to Mr Burton, but that Mr Burton has to go to the police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the matter in perspective. Everything is being blocked in here and nothing is being done by the law enforcement agencies. It is therefore justifiable for the Opposition to say that `put up or shut up' must be interpreted on the basis of those paid to enforce the law following it through. </PARA>
<PARA> In my near 25 years in this place I have on occasions been strongly supportive of our law enforcement agencies. If the police, for whatever reason, have decided that they are not going to pick up the phone, that is their decision and I do not want to criticise them. But in here, there is someone answerable and responsible for the Australian Federal Police and he has the capacity to pick up the phone and say, `Look, I can't direct you, but this has got a smell that won't go away. Why don't you call on Mr Burton, as you normally would?'. That is all that has to be done. Let me finish quoting from the answer provided by the Attorney-General:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Burton has not given the AFP any information on the alleged murder and the AFP would only investigate the matter if it had happened in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The matter will have to be investigated by the relevant State Police Force if the alleged murder happened outside the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>In answer to the question, `Has any evidence been found which supports the allegations', the Attorney-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA>No. No evidence can be collected until Mr Burton makes available to the AFP the information he alleges to have. </PARA>
<PARA>As to whether any action has been taken, the Attorney-General stated:</PARA>
<PARA>No action can be taken in respect to the allegations until Mr Burton makes available the information in his possession. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer is unexceptionable unless it begs the question, `Why don't you pop around and have a word with him?'. As I said at the outset of my remarks, if `X' shoots `Y' and `Z' witnesses it and says so, do honourable members really think that the coppers will wait until `Z' strolls in and has a chat with them? They will go and see him. So why cannot contact be made in this regard? Beyond that, when a member of the Federal Cabinet has been named as being involved in this matter, why does the Government want to obstruct? It has been so obstructionist in the matter as to indicate quite clearly now, after many months, that it is covering up-if not covering up the involvement, as I say, of a Minister in a murder, at least covering up and preventing an investigation into the allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is an opportunity at some point to support the matter and have the matter investigated. The fact is, as I say, the police have done nothing. It has all the elements of Alice in Wonderland. The police cannot do anything, they say, unless Mr Burton talks, but why not talk with him?</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the relevant provisions of the Act to which I have referred and the substance of the allegations contained in the article, it is clearly established that, firstly, the allegations do relate to a relevant offence which the National Crime Authority is empowered to investigate; and, secondly, as such, it is the function of the National Crime Authority in regard to which the Committee has jurisdiction to investigate and report upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I close by saying that Mr Burton's article was headlined, `The murder story that won't go to press'. No wonder it is now being referred to as, `The murder story that won't go away'. It could go away if the allegation is absurd, if the allegation is unfounded-and I do not know. All I know is that any attempt to ascertain whether there is anything in it is being obstructed all the way and even the most cursory action, such as picking up the phone and telling the police to go and have a chat with Mr Burton, is not being done by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a deliberate strategy to smear and generally denigrate the role of the NCA and what it has been doing. Before I turn to that matter, let me refer to the nonsense of the honourable member's claim that the NCA ought to be dealing with this matter. I also want to put to bed in one or two seconds his claim that the journalist has not received approaches from the Australian Federal Police (AFP). I think he will find, if he makes proper investigations, that Mr Burton has been advised by the AFP-and that means that they have spoken with him and have not sat on their hands, as the honourable member said-that if he wishes to make material available to them, they will arrange for the transmission of it to the relevant police authorities. He has not been prepared to do that. That is a matter between him and them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People ought to understand what is going on in this regard. This is an attempt somehow to draw an inference that the National Crime Authority is not interested in dealing with the matter and that it ought to be looking at it. That can be quickly dispensed with by reading section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act which relates to the duties of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and its role in directing the NCA about what it might or might not investigate. Section 55 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Nothing in this Part authorizes the Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to investigate a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) reconsider the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the Authority's charter that necessarily says it ought to be picking up every press statement and going to work on it. </PARA>
<PARA> What causes me concern about this is that we have just been through a very unfortunate set of circumstances in the last three weeks. It is a matter about which I rushed in here and spoke in the adjournment debate a couple of weeks ago, with about five minutes notice, following a complete breach of trust by two members of the Opposition in the other place, Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne. When they breached the trust of the Committee, they breached the trust that had been reached with me in bringing forward a motion to enable them to dissent. In the breach of that trust they completely moved against every principle of dealing with in camera evidence. In doing so, they broke down five years of work that the parliamentary Joint Committee had been doing with the National Crime Authority in building a relationship in which there could be a reasonable exchange of information. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne breached the trust to the point-I do not mind telling the Parliament this-that about two or three weeks ago, or it might be a bit longer than that, the new Chairman of the NCA, Justice Phillips, met with the NCA parliamentary Joint Committee. It was his first meeting with the Joint Committee. He said that he had observed the relationships that had developed over the years. He had seen the difficulties about the disclosure of sensitive information and the fact that politicians seem to want to rush into the Parliament and blab information through these processes. This led to a very difficult relationship between the NCA and the parliamentary Joint Committee. He said that he had noticed the shift that had taken place since Mr Farris had taken up his chairmanship, and he took at face value the fact that we on the Committee were anxious to keep the new trend going. The most important words were that he saw no reason why the parliamentary Joint Committee and the NCA could not get much closer together, including the detailed access to the information that we may think we want. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the most generous and, quite frankly, astonishing position for him to take as a new chairman, and much more generous than I had expected. It showed that finally the parliamentary Joint Committee had won the confidence of the NCA on the very issue around which relationships operate, that is, professionally and responsibly dealing with sensitive information about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Having reached that point, how do we get to a stage when last week Justice Phillips had to say informally to the Committee that he did not see any way that the NCA could deal with the Committee other than on the transcript and totally publicly? In other words, five years of work went down the drain in two weeks of work by two people who were either absolute novices at the game and have blown it with their need to see their names in print or part of a broader strategy aimed at discrediting the NCA in some way and dragging it into disrepute without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> In that particular instance Senators Vanstone and Crichton-Browne asked that the NCA Committee table a report on Operation Ark in South Australia so that we could rule the line off on the matter. We discussed that at some length. I moved the notion that we table that report. I accepted, as did other members of the Committee, that there was a need to get it finalised in South Australia. They then indicated in the Committee meeting that they wanted to issue a dissenting statement. I said, `Hang on, what's this all about?' It was very clearly stated-my other colleague in the House here today will verify this-that the dissent was simply to be their protest that we had used the guillotine to get the matter finished and that there would not be a further delay of another three or four weeks to consider the transcript after we had sat there and had about five hours of discussion with a number of Queen's Counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that I was prepared to provide the vehicle, the report on Operation Ark, and I was prepared to wear their dissent on the matter of that procedure, but I was not prepared to have that dissent cover the issues that had been involved in the in camera discussions. They agreed to it on that basis. No sooner had that happened than they were in the Senate tabling all the confidential documents and statements, naming eminent QCs, and the other things that they had to see. This is the very reason that we want to treat this sensitively, but it is causing us to be in a situation in which, quite frankly, even if the proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong were viable and if it was a matter that could be discussed between the NCA and the Committee, it is not practical. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no relationship now between the parliamentary Joint Committee and the NCA that can work in any kind of sensitive or reasonable way, because the honourable member for Kooyong and his people-not the honourable member; I withdraw that-in the other place have completely stuffed this up. There are people in the Opposition who have put in a lot of time trying to fix this problem and who have seen it now all come undone because of the actions of these novices. I would like to think it was naive, but in fact I think it is conspiratorial. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is conspiratorial for one other reason that I have to draw into this scenario. There has been considerable discussion about the apparent investigation by the NCA of matters related to the money trail. One of the names that have been canvassed was that of the former President of the Liberal Party. The first person in the Parliament, as far as I know-certainly the first person in any way connected with the parliamentary Joint Committee or the National Crime Authority-to mention Mr Elliott's name was a member from the honourable member for Kooyong's side of the House. Yet last week the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties came before our Committee in a public submission and complained that, among other things, the NCA had been responsible during an election campaign for the bagging of the former President of the Liberal Party. The NCA had nothing to do with that. It never made a statement about it. It never mentioned his name. It was never raised anywhere. Yet here are members of the Opposition coming in here trying to continue this pot boiling about the NCA and its political objectives. No wonder Justice Phillips now feels the way he does. What sort of relationship can he have?</PARA>
<PARA> I oppose this motion not only because it is just simply not viable in terms of the legislation-it is not one of the powers that the parliamentary Joint Committee has, nor is it in my opinion a matter that the NCA ought to be dealing with itself; it is a matter for the relevant State police authorities and they have nothing to do with the parliamentary Joint Committee-but because, even if the parliamentary Joint Committee could do so, it has no relationship now with the NCA where sensitive material like this could be discussed and made viable. No matter what takes place, the NCA is entitled to believe that Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne will simply take the first bit of juicy public information that they can get themselves a headline about, and rush into the other place and put it on the deck in there. I oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) condemns the persistent human rights violations by all sides including extrajudicial executions, `disappearances' and torture in Sri Lanka which affect the population in both north and south and which are outlined in recent reports by Amnesty International;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) set up an independent commission of inquiry into extrajudicial executions, the result of which should be made public; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) investigate impartially, through an independent commission of inquiry, the whereabouts or fate of all people reported to have `disappeared';</PARA>
<PARA> (3) while understanding the very real constraints placed upon the Sri Lankan Government by the conflict, urges the Government of Sri Lanka to ensure strict control, including a clear chain of command, over all officials responsible for apprehension, arrest, detention, custody and imprisonment as well as over all officials authorised by law to use force and firearms; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) urges the Australian Government to seek whatever ways are appropriate to bring a halt to all human rights abuses carried out by all armed parties in Sri Lanka and urges all parties involved to exercise maximum restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>The history of Sri Lanka for the past 15 years has been one of murder, torture and mayhem-forced disappearances and massive abuse of human rights. It has been a tragedy of enormous proportions which has cost over 100,000 lives since 1976. It is an absolute disaster for this island nation and its people. The motion which I have moved today is a statement reflecting the depth of distress and despair felt by members on both sides of this House and the people of Australia at the ongoing tragedy that is Sri Lanka today. </PARA>
<PARA> I, like many honourable members, have the honour to represent in this place a significant number of Sri Lankan born Australian citizens and residents. I count amongst my friends a number of fine and hard-working people both of Tamil and Singhalese origins. They, like me, despair at the ongoing loss of life and property in their former homeland. They have sought my help to have some outside intervention brought into this situation, to bring a cessation to the killing and some meaningful negotiations between all parties involved. They seek our nation's involvement through the Commonwealth and through direct discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sri Lankan community in Australia, and in my electorate, recognises the efforts that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Opposition foreign affairs spokesperson, Senator Robert Hill, to try to bring some pressure on all parties in this crisis to find a negotiated solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate feature of the Sri Lankan tragedy is that all sides have been guilty of intolerable acts of abuse of human rights involving mass murder, torture and heavy destruction of property. To fully understand the reasons for the violent actions which are taking place in Sri Lanka, it is essential to understand the diversity of the country's people. Sri Lanka is divided into several major ethnic groups. The largest of these is Singhalese, who are generally Buddhist. Tamils are the next largest group, who are mostly Hindu. Muslims represent a sizeable minority group, the majority of whom are in fact Tamil speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> It is these inter-ethnic relations which have steadily deteriorated over the last 15 years leading to a situation of civil war. Caste groups also operate within the Tamil and Singhalese communities and vie with one another to seek economic and political advantage. The tensions between the Tamils and the Singhalese were not aided by a former government policy of instituting measures to ensure state support of the Singhalese language and culture. </PARA>
<PARA> The conflict between the Tamils and the Singhalese was accelerated by political demands for an independent Tamil state in the north east of Sri Lanka, first made in 1976. It was hoped to achieve this objective by working within the established democratic framework and initially the groups advocating an independent state did not advocate the use of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> However, by 1978, several violent attacks on the police in Jaffna had occurred. These were attributed to the newly formed group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, more commonly referred to today as the Tamil Tigers. In the following years, other Tamil separatist groups were formed in north-eastern Sri Lanka to engage in armed confrontation and opposition to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The separatist demand has been fuelled by disputes over the allocation of resources in Sri Lanka, access to education, jobs in the state sector and a general perception by minorities in that country that the state is identified only with the majority Singhalese interests and with Buddhism. Ethnic violence against the Tamils in the south also contributed to the call for independence, particularly amongst young Tamil people. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Indo-Sri Lanka accord in 1987, several Tamil militant groups allied themselves with Indian troops deployed in the north east of the island. The Tamil Tigers, however, opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka accord and continued the policy of armed action in pursuit of a separate state-now against the Indian forces and members of certain Tamil groups allied with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Widespread killings of both Tamil and non-Tamil civilians were committed by the Tamil Tigers in the period during which the Indian peacekeeping forces were deployed in the north east. For example, in March 1988, the Tamil Tigers reportedly attacked two Singhalese villages, leaving 15 people dead at one and killing 40 Muslims at another. The worst single attack on civilians attributed to the Tamil Tigers occurred in October 1988 where 47 villagers reportedly died. The Tamil Tigers also killed many Tamils suspected of opposing them or informing against them, and members of the civil administration with whom they disagreed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of armed opposition from these Tamil secessionists, the Sri Lankan Government gave extraordinary powers to its security forces. Unfortunately, grave violations have resulted, and the Sri Lankan security forces increasingly appear to believe that they can commit abuses with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prevention of Terrorism Act has been in force since July 1989, and there has been a nationwide state of emergency since May 1983. Both the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the emergency regulations give the security forces wide powers to arrest suspected opponents of the Government and detain them incommunicado without charge or trial for long periods. Under these conditions, reports of gross human rights violations by Sri Lankan Government forces-and of political violence more generally-reached a peak in 1989. In the south of the island, thousands of people disappeared or were victims of extrajudicial execution. </PARA>
<PARA> According to reports by Amnesty International, these were committed by uniformed members of the Sri Lankan security forces and plain clothed death squads drawn from the security forces. The tactics of these forces increasingly mirrored the violent methods used by the armed opposition groups. In addition, Amnesty claims that thousands of people were detained without charge or trial, and there were widespread allegations of torture and deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north east, the Indian peacekeeping force-which was deployed in Sri Lanka in July 1987 and had completed a phased withdrawal by the end of March 1990-was reported to have committed extrajudicial executions and to have been responsible for many disappearances. There were also numerous allegations of torture of prisoners by members of the Indian forces and Tamil groups allied to them. Some prisoners died while in custody, apparently as a result of torture or deliberate shooting. Others were shot dead shortly after their release, reportedly by members of Tamil groups allied to the Indian peacekeeping forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Armed opposition presents governments and security forces with particular difficulties. Governments bear the responsibility of protecting their citizens from violent crime and for bringing those responsible to justice. In doing so, however, they must ensure that fundamental human rights, particularly the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture, are respected. </PARA>
<PARA> We must condemn the killing and torture of prisoners by opposition groups, and we strongly condemn the actions of the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna, the Tamil Tigers, and other armed opposition groups in Sri Lanka. Yet it is in precisely such contexts of armed opposition that fundamental human rights need to be protected with extra vigilance by governments. The use of force beyond that necessary in the circumstances to prevent crime or to carry out the lawful arrest of suspected offenders is simply not acceptable. The deliberate killing of unarmed demonstrators or unarmed suspects, as an alternative to arrest, detention and trial, violates the prohibition on the arbitrary deprivation of life. Unfortunately, this has been the case in Sri Lanka in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of excessive force by governments has frequently resulted in the escalation of internal conflict rather than its limitation. This has also been evident in Sri Lanka in recent times. Recognising the difficulties which the Sri Lankan Government faces in controlling the violence between various groups, I believe the simplest way to achieve a peaceful solution to the situation in Sri Lanka is by Commonwealth action. This course of action has already been suggested by the Prime Minister in a private communique to the President of Sri Lanka, President Premadasa. I am also aware that Senator Hill has met with the Commonwealth Secretary General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, and has proposed similar measures. The Australian Council for Overseas Aid has also asked the Government to support a Commonwealth role in settlement of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Action must be taken to cease the bloodshed. If Sri Lanka is to develop as a nation to its full potential, then the senseless violence and gross violation of human rights must stop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While supporting the general thrust of the motion before us today, both as the member for Groom and as a member of Amnesty International, I do so in the knowledge that such support in no way removes or reduces the very real atrocities that continue in Sri Lanka as I speak. While what is stated in paragraph 2 of the motion on the setting up of an independent commission of inquiry by the Sri Lankan Government may be seen by some to impinge on Sri Lanka's sovereignty, it nevertheless has to be said. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has quite correctly commented, Sri Lanka is a very beautiful country sliding quickly down the increasingly greasy pole of self-destruction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tragic thing is that only a very small minority of its people seek to perpetuate this very bloody, callous conflict where life is cheap and where basic human rights are a thing of the past. All the parties, government and otherwise, must accept a share of the blame for the continuation of this conflict. As the Sri Lankan journalist Dr Jehan Perera, who is now visiting Australia-and I am delighted to see him in the gallery-said in a recent article, the conflict:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was not a war we wanted. Nor is it one that must be permitted to drag on. The casualties are very heavy. It is a life for a life, a bullet for a bullet, a limb for a limb and an atrocity for an atrocity. An entire population threatens once again to become an enemy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no slogan more calculated to dehumanise than the cry that this is a fight to the finish or that this is our last fight. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Sinhalese and Tamils are polarised and driven under the leadership of two different and monolithic power blocs, shattering the pluralism that was gradually emerging within both communities. </PARA>
<PARA>Vested interests grow that benefit from the perpetuation of the war. We struggle to remain human beings and not being fired up ethnic beings. </PARA>
<PARA>Almost against our wishes, we find ourselves taking grim satisfaction in the death toll of the other side. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes that:</PARA>
<PARA>The gun may very well impose conditions for peace, but it cannot create peace. Peace flows from a new attitude of mind, from forgiveness and fairplay. </PARA>
<PARA>Elements of the Premadasa Government, the Tamil Tigers and the Moslem minority must all share the shame and the guilt for media reports such as one I read by Gabriella Gamini in the Sun Age newspaper on 28 October. That article headed, `Hussein Spark Ignites Tamil Moslems' said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>There used to be 600 families in Saddam Hussein village. They lived in neatly-arranged little houses and prayed in their own, small mosque-all built in 1982 with a $A213,000 gift to local Moslems from, as the name suggests, the President of Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Four weeks ago, the Tamil Tigers came with guns and drove everybody out. They said the Moslems-like them, a minority in Sri Lanka-had failed to support the Tamils' guerilla war for a separate homeland. It was, by all accounts, a bloody day. </PARA>
<PARA>That in itself is bad enough, but then we read of a further disturbing element of the overall conflict which reveals a Moslem reaction that the only way to defend its culture, its religion and its community is through the power of the gun, through a preparedness to die to defend Islam and through a pride that friend Saddam would be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Amnesty International, instead of trying to end the violence, the Sri Lankan Government has, over the years, intensified it by resorting to widespread repression. The Opposition groups have themselves committed atrocious crimes, but the Government must not use this as an excuse for like brutality. While the circle of violence remains unbroken, there can be no hope of a solution to the problems facing Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Government is responsible for protecting its citizens from violent crimes and for bringing those responsible to justice. It must act now to stop the round of abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the conflict has the potential to feed on itself, not only in terms of military action, but also in terms of its disastrous economic implications. Quite apart from the tens of thousands killed, injured, missing, of refugee status or the destruction of property in recent years, Sri Lanka is a country in which the mainstay of tourism has seen visitor arrivals fall from 400,000 in 1982 to around 100,000 in 1989. Sri Lanka spends some 30 per cent more on imports than it can earn from exports, such as its famous tea. The main food crop of rice has suffered a 20 per cent drop. Unemployment is upwards of 25 per cent and inflation is running at nearly 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Sri Lanka needs help quickly from the international community, but perhaps does not know how best to go about it. Seemingly in desperation, it has lost its way. While wishing to maintain the generally bipartisan nature of this debate, I cannot let the opportunity pass without making the point that initiatives in this direction did not stem from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, (Senator Gareth Evans), but from the shadow foreign Minister, Senator Robert Hill, over three months ago when he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The international community can no longer turn a blind eye to the ongoing tragedy in Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth is uniquely well-placed to play a key role in helping to bring the conflict to an end. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless something is done urgently, this year's death toll could surpass last year's figure of up to 30,000 killed. Yet both sides are presently set to pursue a military solution to their differences and negotiations are unlikely to take place without the assistance of a third party. </PARA>
<PARA>The opportunity for international mediation is enhanced by the fact that both the Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan President Premadasa have in the past 18 months endorsed external mediation. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to this House the major elements of Senator Hill's peace plan. Central to that plan is the establishment of a high level Commonwealth working party tasked to negotiate an immediate cease-fire and to sponsor peace talks with the parties, firstly, by examining how best the Commonwealth could contribute in the monitoring process of the cease-fire; secondly, by exploring the role that the Commonwealth could play in peace talks; thirdly, by offering assistance to the parties in their legal or constitutional ramifications of the maintenance of a lasting peace-for example, there is some talk now of federalism as distinct from a simple devolution of power; and, finally, by examining the degree of economic assistance and forms that it might take in national reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hill has already made a copy of his proposals available to the Minister, to the Sri Lankan Government and to the Commonwealth Secretary-General. As a result of its Cambodian initiatives, Australian credibility in Sri Lanka is understood to be very high indeed and Australia is seen by many there as the ideal neutral umpire in this conflict. I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote to President Premadasa a couple of months ago along the general lines of Senator Hill's proposal, and awaits his reply. I hope that Australia can play its part in Sri Lanka, as it has in the Cambodian deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I reiterate the need for all parties in this conflict to cease fire immediately. I appeal to the Sri Lankan Government and to Commonwealth Secretary-General Anyaoku for acceptance of Senator Hill's proposal for the third-party involvement of the Commonwealth. I impress upon the Sri Lankan Government the need to avoid the re-kindling of communal passions and to pay utmost heed to the distinction between the militants in combat and to civilians. Just as the majority Singhalese must be reassured that their language and culture is safe, so must the Tamils and other minorities have their fears on discrimination in language, education, and employment allayed. I urge the Sri Lankan Government to give the highest priority to the provision of food and drug supplies and not to subordinate these efforts to any starving of the militants into submission. Finally, I urge the Sri Lankan Government to give the most urgent consideration to Prime Minister Hawke's letter. Anything less is to guarantee disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The protection of human rights is a universal responsibility transcending the boundaries of nation, race and belief. What is happening in Sri Lanka today is a tragedy of human dimensions that impacts on us all. Australia has a role to play in stopping the killings and in bringing the warring factions to the negotiating table. The Government of Sri Lanka has a duty and, indeed, a responsibility to uphold the rule of law in Sri Lanka to ensure that human rights violations do not occur. What is happening in Sri Lanka is dirty, bloody, revolting and is driving the people of that nation to further despair, to further killings and to further bloodshed, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Australia and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should be commended for the role that they have played to date in trying to bring the warring factions together. As birds are born to fly, so are people born to be free. They are not born to be abused, to be violated, to be killed, to be executed without a proper judicial trial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are plenty of facts and figures that have been provided by Amnesty International. In view of the limited time that is available I do not propose to repeat them, but I commend to honourable members the briefings by Amnesty International. The magnitude of the deaths that are occurring is disturbing. Amnesty International has recently formed a group within my electorate in the suburb of Revesby and there was a public meeting recently which discussed the Sri Lankan situation. It is our role in the Parliament to raise the consciousness of the community, to raise the consciousness of nations throughout the world, to stop the barbarous acts that are presently taking place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Groom)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.31)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Many of us in this and the other place have attended and/or addressed the so-called rural crisis rallies across the nation in recent weeks. Many of us at those meetings have heard a mixture of understandable emotion, of extreme views, in some cases of deep anger, and of resolutions both good and bad. I reject, for example, such resolutions as a call for the blocking of Supply as a precursor to any change of government that those people might be seeking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of us in recent days have heard the views of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin)-again in this place last evening and no doubt, as I speak, at the National Press Club today-and also those of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) as chairman of the country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Both honourable members vehemently reject not only the usefulness of such meetings but also that there is any sort of rural crisis and that farmers should be singled out for special attention. The honourable member for Hinkler goes so far as to suggest that such crisis meetings talk down the farm commodity markets and that in Queensland those meetings are simply a manifestation of a pork-barrelling National Party plot to lift its dwindling electoral stocks in that State. As a Queensland Liberal member from one of the most productive rural provincial electorates in our country, I categorically reject the views of both the honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, there is self-interest, but that self-interest, I would suggest, is both understandable and justifiable. Clearly, the bottom line economically and politically is that many of those people-and I have addressed about 6000 in the towns of Dalby and Pittsworth in the adjoining electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Scott) in the last three weeks-are crying out for help. They are not crying out for continuing Government handouts but for short term measures to place them back on a level playing field, necessary as a result of the Hawke Government's actions-actions in the case of Iraq and its sanctions, inaction in the case of monetary policy reversals and micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that small business in general, which is the engine room of our economy, and the rural sector in particular, have suffered from the high interest, high taxation, high inflation and, of late, increasing unemployment climate that has prevailed since 1984. This climate, coupled with a price downturn for on-farm products in international markets-perhaps of an unparalleled range-and a bloody-minded `Catch me if you can' approach to draconian subsidies by the European Community and the United States in particular, has placed Australia in the deepest economic peril since, perhaps, the Depression of the 1930s. Urban apathy at their predicament and an uninformed perception by some in the cities of a whingeing, whining squattocracy do not help the rural cause and its understandable attempts to win the wider hearts and minds. </PARA>
<PARA> Yes, as in any other business enterprise, some farmers have overcommitted themselves financially and a small number could be jumping onto the crisis band wagon, using the Government as a convenient whipping post. Yes, at the meetings I have attended there were the instant experts, the would-be Mark Anthonys and opportunists with the overnight solution, and, of course, the inevitable politician-Federal, State or local-with a personal soul to bare and a perennial shoulder to slope. </PARA>
<PARA> For this Government's information-clearly, it does not want to hear this, otherwise it would have been represented at the meetings-not only are farmers now adversely affected, but also the problem is starting to feed through increasingly into the country townships and provincial centres such as those in my electorate, where farm machinery dealers, seed merchants, local pubs and even the schools are already being affected. For example, headmasters at the eight boarding schools in Toowoomba, which since the turn of the century has been a centre of educational excellence for kids in the bush, are reporting up to 25 per cent reductions in enrolments for 1991. Clearly, the crisis has the potential to feed on itself and we are fast approaching an economic terminal tail spin. </PARA>
<PARA> While I do not resile from the strongest condemnation of the Hawke Government on many issues, in the context of these rallies I have to say that the time for undue political one-upmanship has passed. The principal message that I have received at these meetings is that people out there no longer want hot air and rhetoric; they want team action and they want action in the national interest. For some, words may be easy. However, real progress on the issues is a little more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of the speakers said in Pittsworth, in the main politicians are reactors, not innovators. I have to agree with the thrust of those sentiments. On both sides of this place we really do need to lift our game. We remain on the nose out there and we should be left in no doubt about who put us here. Furthermore, for anyone to stand up at those meetings and say that he or she has the overnight solution is for that person to lie through his or her back teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a further move away from the high interest rate regime of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and, with that, an associated depreciation of the Australian dollar. Nevertheless, those measures in themselves will not cure our economic problems. We need political guts and a policy resolve for real reform-reform in the workplace, the enterprise bargaining approach that we heard so much about on both sides of this House; reform on the waterfront, remembering that it takes longer and costs more to ship from Port Kembla to Gove than it does from Port Kembla to Los Angeles, and that while we can get our goods to the wharf gate quickly and efficiently, that is where the basic problem begins; reform in our approach to public enterprise-in other words, the talkfest growth area of privatisation; and finally, reform-real reform-in our public expenditure levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of these areas, this Government has simply paid lip-service to substantive change and it remains the conduit through which Mr Kelty, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and its mates attempt to dictate the national agenda. In government, we will change that. Genuine and speedy reform will follow and, I have to say, it will follow quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the rural sector, it is not enough simply to lecture it and all its members on the longer term benefits of these long overdue reforms. Understandably, the rural sector wants to know now what the Government is going to do and how it is going to be got out of the hole, which is principally of the Government's making. I hope that many honourable members on both sides of this House will agree with some or all of the following initiatives that I suggest in the shorter term. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, there must be compensation to grain growers for losses associated with Iraq's payment inabilities. The Prime Minister has promised a lot on this but he has achieved very little. Secondly, in my view we need to withstand pressures for further lowering of the floor price for wool and pressures to indulge in any short term fix when it comes to that vital industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we need to make it clear that the proposed assets test, family allowance and Austudy areas are inequitable for the rural sector in Australia in particular and that the present legislation needs to be reconsidered and it needs to be reconsidered now. We need to look at diesel fuel rebates for on-farm machinery and equipment with a view to some increases. We need to look at a review of export inspection charges, on which I commented in the adjournment debate a couple of evenings ago. We need to take action in relation to the importation of food stuffs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate following a question asked by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). On Tuesday last he asked the Prime Minister to give directions to the Trades Hall Council about what he-the honourable member for Kooyong-regarded as a serious and blatant interference with the rights of a free press. Of course, he was referring to the facts relating to the current Hoechst Australia Ltd dispute taking place in Victoria. It is my concern to deal with that dispute at several levels. Firstly, I want to draw to the attention of the House the role of the press in respect of the dispute; and secondly, I want to put the facts before the House as to the cause of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of this House have on many occasions risen after Question Time to indicate to the House that they have been misreported, that statements have been made about them which are false, and they are able to place on the record their answer to misrepresentations that have taken place concerning them in the press. We are all used to that. Privileges committees, having to deal on occasions with journalists, have had journalists-and I support them in this-vigorously assert their right to protect their source of information and refuse to disclose the source of that information. </PARA>
<PARA> That being the case, let us deal with the central issue in the Hoechst dispute. The central issue goes to a question of health and safety. What is the role of a shop steward or a member of the work force if he is working in an area where there is a clear breach of health and safety regulations; where there are substances which are used that are dangerous and can cause serious physical disability and disease to fellow workers? Does he have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of the company or is he acting responsibly if he draws those facts to the attention of his member of parliament or if he draws it to the attention of a representative of the media?</PARA>
<PARA> The facts concerning the situation at Hoechst were drawn to the attention of the media. A shop steward was dismissed on the basis that he had broken the confidentiality of the company, and that raises a fairly novel concept. The media representative concerned has, I understand, publicly indicated that he organised his own access to the factory, he observed the circumstances, he spoke to people at a much more senior level than the shop steward concerned, and he put his information as he found it to air. The result was that the shop steward was dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the role of the Herald-Sun newspaper in this? It seems to have got itself embroiled in a series of allegations and editorials directed at everything else except the central issue. What is its view of the right to protect any citizen who draws the media's attention to a matter of grave public concern? Dealing with this central issue, the only reference it ever made to it was in a feature article by a journalist, Julia Lim, on 24 October. The article was headlined `A Technical Nightmare', the implication being that it is impossible to make a judgment about the health and safety issues in the dispute. The article includes union arguments that in 1988 Hoechst's own industrial hygienist identified a possible link between a substance known as DCB and two instances of bladder cancer amongst Hoechst workers. </PARA>
<PARA> It also mentions that the health department had found that Hoechst had failed to confine the processing of carcinogenic materials within a sealed unit and that six workers at the plant had tested positive to a type of cell damage that DCB is suspected of causing. Is that not a matter of concern? Would any honourable member not be concerned if his son or his father or a relative was involved in that situation? Is there no public concern about the maintenance of proper safety procedures?</PARA>
<PARA> The article omits a number of other important facts. The substance in question, DCB, is a known animal carcinogen. As recently as May 1990 Worksafe Australia designated DCB as probably a human carcinogen and recommended that it be handled as if it were a human carcinogen. This implies that no worker should come in contact with the substance either directly or in fume form. DCB is used in sealed form in the company's German plants. That is interesting. Presumably the Herald-Sun would find it quite permissible for the standards of safety which operate in the principal company in Germany not to be necessarily appropriate in Australia. Workers at Hoechst have worked with DCB in non-seal contact situations and these conditions prevailed when the dispute commenced. </PARA>
<PARA> That is at the heart of the dispute and I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard material headed `Hoechst and the unions agree' by Dr Burger, the industrial officer for health and safety of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. It simply sets out the known facts in respect of DCB. I understand the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) at the table has seen it and approves of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I believe that when a company is clearly involved in unsafe practices, it cannot be heard to argue that a worker who draws those practices to the attention of a member of parliament, to the relevant law authorities or to the media has somehow breached company confidentiality. That is a bit like saying, `If we are in breach of the law and you work for us, you have to be an accessory either before the fact or after the fact.' It is an unsustainable proposition. Now what has happened to this precious commodity which the press defends when its own interests are involved, namely, the right to protect the source of information? Where is the editorial of the Herald-Sun indicating that this dispute may well have been resolved if Hoechst had not overreacted and sacked someone who was performing a public duty in bringing what is a clearly dangerous situation to the attention of the media?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there are double standards. At the very time when the Hoechst dispute was listed before the Industrial Relations Commission the company's management attempted to advertise to replace the 74 striking workers that it subsequently sacked. Let me make this comment: the Herald-Sun chooses what form of advertisements it will take. The newspaper will not take an advertisement from the manager of a brothel or a house of ill repute and I believe it is probably right in that. But I would have thought that prudent management would be concerned to preserve industrial relations in the community. Having regard to the known facts of this dispute and the fact that the dispute was listed for hearing, it was my view that it was extremely provocative to be carrying an advertisement, not putting Hoechst's view of the dispute, because I believe the trade union movement would have welcomed the public airing of all the facts, but virtually advertising for scab labour. </PARA>
<PARA> If anything was designed to exacerbate a dispute, it was that action. I hope that this matter will be successfully resolved but what I am concerned about is the double standards that have been applied here. I believe the management of the Herald-Sun have been mendacious in the way they have approached this whole issue. They have been concerned to put a jaundiced, one-sided view of the facts in issue. They have by their own actions been prepared to exacerbate the industrial tensions that are surrounding this dispute. They have not fulfilled the role of a free press in a democratic society and for that they should be condemned. At the moment they seem to be involved in a fairly blatant and consistent attack at every level on the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the facts of this dispute, once aired, will throw a new light on what has occurred. I hope the matter will be brought before the relevant industrial tribunal as soon as possible. It is neither in the interests of the work force nor in the interests of the broad community that these practices at Hoechst should continue, and it is certainly not in the interests of the Victorian economy or the Australian economy that this industrial dispute should continue for any great length of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nowhere are the effects of the excessive economic, social and family pressures experienced by Australians today being felt more than in rural Australia. The effects of these pressures on hard-working people in regional towns and those on the land have been so invasive that we are now witnessing the slow, lingering death of heartland Australia. Rural Australia has always been important to the overall economic well-being of our nation. It has been, if you like, the powerhouse that has produced our meat, fibre, crops and minerals. It has driven us forward and has provided us with a solid foundation on which to build other industries-heavy, hi-tech, and more recently, of course, tourism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regional Australia consists of both town and country. In the past, town and country always managed to coexist for their mutual benefit. Each has always managed to support the other through periods of great hardship, such as the Great Depression and two world wars. But it is different today. For the first time in our history, that mutual support that has always ensured regional viability and survival is being torn apart. The small businessman cannot give credit to the family on the land because he is valiantly trying to keep his own business afloat. Nationally, in the past financial year small business bankruptcies increased to 9,131, up 11 per cent from the previous financial year. Conversely, the farmer is barely making ends meet, so he is unable to support businesses in his local district. It has become a vicious circle. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of this is that these circumstances have been inflicted on the people of country Australia by this Government's monetary policy of high interest rates. In the past, in spite of the many extra outside pressures, people managed to hang onto their farms and businesses and families remained intact. The difference today is that country Australia is battling on all fronts: it is battling against high interest rates, high inflation, high taxation and a shrinking market for its commodities and services. Added to that, country Australia has been cynically and deliberately neglected by this city-oriented Government with its strong trade union base. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1980s the first thing that was noticed as one drove through rural Australia was that the roads were well maintained; there was a sense of vitality in the towns; businesses were thriving; there was a feeling of well-being and a community of pride; the infrastructure of the local community was in good shape; and industries were viable and provided good opportunities for local employment. Driving out of the town, well stocked properties would be observed, pastures and fencing were in good order and there was a quiet, efficient air. Driving through those same towns today, the start of the 1990s, the first thing that is felt are the potholes. It will be noticed that there are badly broken shoulders on the roads and mile after mile of poorly maintained and inadequately patched roads, thanks to a reduction of funding for roads by this Government of 40 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The towns are no longer busy. There are many empty premises whose owners have been forced to close their doors, many of whom had lived and worked in their community for years. Farms are in need of repair and maintenance, but there is no money for the materials or the labour to repair them. It will also be discovered that one of the towns greatest assets, its local hospital, is struggling to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The delivery of health services, so often taken for granted, is now under threat in many country centres, especially in country Victoria where many hospitals have been forced to close wards. For example, a hospital in my own electorate has insufficient funds to continue operating its accident and emergency centre. Another hospital in Yea recently held a community fund raising campaign for much needed funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Industries have been forced to close their doors, adding to the escalating unemployment figures. Increasing numbers of families have been forced by high interest rates to move even further out into rural areas in order to afford a home, only to find that their fuel costs for commuting to larger cities for employment becomes prohibitive. The women in these families, often without any extended family support, find themselves isolated with young children. There is little prospect of employment and even if they found work, they would be hard pressed to find child-care. Many women have been forced to travel long distances to obtain employment and often have to accept jobs well below their level of qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> Travelling into any town today it will be found that a growing percentage of the towns nurses, teachers and shop assistants are farmers wives. Those who cannot find employment still do voluntary work such as Red Cross, Meals on Wheels, et cetera, as well as their extra farm duties. As one woman said at the recently formed Rural Women in Crisis forum last week in Wangaratta, women are working on their farms to feed others and they work off the farms to feed their families. The excessive financial pressures on families is the most significant factor in the breakdown of families today. </PARA>
<PARA> Those working in the field of family counselling talk of increased domestic violence, child abuse and desertion as the by-products of this financial pressure, all contributing to untold pressures on the family. Add to these lack of facilities and higher cost of living and the pressures on families in country Australia have become even greater. The net result of these excessive pressures is that small towns are dying, farms are losing their viability and valuable industries are closing down. Families, the core unit that has provided the solid foundation to rural Australia, are beginning to disintegrate. The pressures are just too great. </PARA>
<PARA> Communities, the lifeline of country Australia, are facing a tough battle to retain services; in fact, many of these services, such as Meals on Wheels, transport for the elderly, senior citizens meetings and home help, are only being provided because of the goodwill and dedication of local residents. Finances from local councils and community support groups are stretched to the limit. Not only are volunteers finding it increasingly difficult to raise much needed funds in these difficult times, but also the calls on their services are increasing. Most are being expected to provide more with fewer resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In many instances this Federal Government has encouraged organisations to provide local services, but after some initial funding and raising the expectations of local residents it has then either reduced or withdrawn funding and left the local community to pick up the tab. Before it is too late we must ask ourselves: what are these excessive pressures doing to the next generation? I suggest that they are being denied the choice to remain in rural areas. These excessive conditions are producing a crushing of the human spirit. They are painting a bleak future; so much so that most young people from rural Australia are leaving for the city in droves. These excessive pressures on our farming communities, our small businesses, our families, our ageing population and our youth are producing an emptiness and despair in rural Australia-they are producing a wintering without any spring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not fail to respond to some of the remarks made by the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey). I note that she concentrates on the situation in rural Australia. I certainly concede that there are great difficulties. If she wants a lesson on how the heart has been cut out of rural Australia she should come along to her colleagues in New South Wales and she will see what devastation in rural Australia is all about. Hospitals have being closed, railway lines have been closed and services to rural Australia have been absolutely decimated. I found most objectionable her contribution on the impact of high interest rates and inflation and fuel costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ought to be noted that interest rates under the Labor Government have never reached the dizzy heights of 1983. It is all very well for the honourable member for McEwen to leave the chamber, but before she does she should note that she omitted to mention the fact that the consumer price index figure that we got yesterday was at a 15-year low. We are still to reach the dizzy heights of inflation that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) used to deliver when he was Treasurer and his economic adviser was the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), now the Opposition leader. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it helps the real plight of rural Australia, as it confronts collapsing world markets, particularly in wheat and wool, if we play a political game. We try to minimise the difficulties of the next couple of years as those rural industries restructure. I do not want to play a political game when I take the point that she makes about closing industries. The honourable member for McEwen failed to inform the House that she is happy to support, has put her hand up to support, an industry policy which says that there should be no assistance whatsoever to industry by the year 2000. I think it is somewhat hypocritical for the honourable member for McEwen to suggest that the real difficulties being faced by rural Australia have somehow been engineered by this Government at a time when interest rates have come down quite significantly. We have had the best inflation figure. The real problem has been the commodity prices that wheat and wool are fetching. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I object most of all on the issue of fuel prices because the honourable member for McEwen did not say that the New South Wales conservative Government has placed a 3c a litre surcharge on fuel in New South Wales. No other State government has imposed such a tax. If she is complaining about high fuel costs in Victoria, what does the honourable member for McEwen have to say about the situation in New South Wales? Why is she silent about that? Is it fair to ask why the Opposition, like the former Opposition in New South Wales-the Greiner Opposition-remains silent about a proposal to increase fuel tax? Could that be the hidden agenda of the Victorian Opposition? I think the honourable member for McEwen at least ought to have the decency to her constituents to come clean about that, to comment about the situation in New South Wales and whether the State Opposition in Victoria would impose this absolute slug. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is not only a slug on rural Australia; it is also a slug in areas like western Sydney where I live and where people are so dependent on transport. That brings me to an issue that I wanted to raise and on which I and the Government have been attacked by a State Liberal member in New South Wales, Mrs Cohen, the member for Minchinbury, who is suggesting that the Federal Government is going to reap a windfall profit from the current petrol prices. Of course, this statement is not even supported by the Leader of the Opposition, who at least has the decency to say that it is too early to tell. I will quote him directly:</PARA>
<PARA>In other words it is too early to establish whether there will be any windfall . . . I'm not clear in my own mind that the net effect on the Budget is positive. </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about increasing petrol prices. I think that is a fair statement. The other point I should make is that there is every possibility, if petrol consumption declines, that increasing petrol prices will be a net minus on the Budget. In any event, if we were to return money, if we were to lower petrol prices, it is going to cost something like $340m to deliver a little over a 1c decrease in the at-the-bowser price. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government were to do this, as I think the honourable member for McEwen was suggesting, I think average motorists would see it as a rather derisory amount. For us, $340m is a huge amount off the Budget. Motorists would see such a small decline in the price of petrol as derisory and I would be inclined to agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Cohen goes on to make the point that the Federal Government does not care about western Sydney. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The Labor Party, whether it is in the Federal sphere or the State sphere, is very deeply rooted into the western suburbs of Sydney. Let me give a few examples: in the last State Labor Government there were eight Ministers who came from the western suburbs of Sydney. In the shadow Ministry currently there are six shadow Ministers who come from the western suburbs of Sydney. I am reminded that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) prior to coming into the Federal Parliament, for example, was a former shadow Minister from the western suburbs of Sydney, as was my colleague the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) a shadow Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, western Sydney provided a lot of members for the former State Government and the present Opposition and they more adequately represented the area. The needs and aspirations of the area were being articulated by very good backbench members and, of course, they had the clout in the Cabinet where it counts. One ought to ask the question: how many Ministers from western Sydney are there in the Greiner Government? The answer is very simple: not one. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest to Mrs Cohen that rather than attacking us on fuel prices she ought to come clean on tolls. Why, for example, has she put her hand up to agree with the Greiner Government to impose a toll on the F4 Freeway and the Prospect Freeway when that missing link on the F4 could have been fully funded if the State Government had only classified it as a national arterial road?</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than impose a toll on National Party electorates, the New South Wales Government was quite happy to hit the motorists of western Sydney between the eyes. They are currently facing a surcharge of 3c a litre, which no other State or Territory imposes. Mrs Cohen is happy to have this toll imposed on the people of western Sydney. Why will she not tell them how much? Why will she not tell the motorists in the western suburbs of Sydney whether they will have to pay $2 or $5 every day in addition to what they are paying now? Why will she not come clean on that issue? Why will she not take the people of western Sydney into her confidence?</PARA>
<PARA> I will point out the hypocrisy of Liberal State members in western Sydney. During the last State election they campaigned on the basis that the State Labor Government was going to impose a toll-that was the scaremongering tactic they ran-when, in fact, there was no plan by the Unsworth Government to do so. What did they do when they were in government? They imposed a 3c a litre surcharge on petrol, and they have the audacity to point a finger at the Federal Labor Government. In addition to that, they have placed a toll on Western suburb residents. That is not good enough. I am sure that people will see through such a false position. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Cohen ought to ring the Leader of the Opposition who is publicly on the record as saying that he does not believe it is a windfall. I am surprised that she should be quoting an organisation such as the National Roads and Motorists Association which has stamped itself as being very political. It is interesting to note in relation to the Grafton bus crash--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two weeks ago, on 24 October, Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television celebrated its tenth anniversary as a multicultural broadcaster. We had a motion in this House earlier today making some mention of that. I do not believe that the anniversary can be let pass without Parliament noting the achievements of SBS television over that 10 years and acknowledging the personal dedication and effort of SBS employees in making that possible. SBS is a very lean, very effective organisation. I know this is a grievance debate, and it would seem a little unusual for me to be raising this matter in a grievance debate. I am, in fact, grieving about this situation because I think SBS has proved itself such a very competitive organisation that I grieve for the fact that not more resources are being made available to it. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it has provided a wonderful example of how a fairly small budget, in fact a comparatively very small budget, can be used most effectively. I believe that if more resources were made available to SBS, then it could demonstrate to an even greater extent its capacity to provide all sorts of entertainment and information to a wider group of people, and that should occur. I grieve that more resources are not made available to SBS by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Going back to the start of SBS, many of my colleagues will recall the apprehension which many of us felt when we first tuned in or attempted to tune into those first transmissions. I was grateful to be part of the decision-making process which led to the establishment of SBS in those days. For many viewers with old style television sets, or those who did not install a special VHF aerial, the SBS transmissions were either unavailable or of such poor screen quality that it took a very persevering person to go through and continue to watch the programs that were then being screened, and they were particularly good programs that were being screened, and have continued to be screened. Add to that the uncertain audience reaction to foreign films and programs and their associated subtitling, and I believe there is little wonder that some sceptics were forecasting a very sickly childhood for multicultural broadcasting. That they have been proven wrong is not only a credit to the way in which SBS has tackled its charter, but also to the extent to which there was an unrealised demand for and an appreciation of quality multicultural television programming within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think many people understood the very real demand-a demand that continues to expand-that was out there in the general community for this style of broadcasting. The impact of SBS television on the wider Australian community is one of the most significant and largely unpredicted benefits of multicultural broadcasting. I readily admit that in those early months I was a supporter of SBS television, not because I expected to be a regular viewer but because I accepted the need for such a service in the sort of multicultural society that Australia had become by the early 1980s. For example, in my own electorate of Warringah, which is located on Sydney's North Shore in an area that many would regard as being solidly middle class Australian, we find through census information that 25 per cent of the Warringah population were born overseas, that 4.8 per cent of those have been Australian residents for less than five years, and that 1.8 per cent were not fluent in English. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is simply that Australia is a multicultural society, and this is as much a reality in Manly, Mosman or Brookvale as it is in Riverwood, Fairfield or Blacktown. As to what SBS television was chartered to do and has achieved, I quote from its 1988-89 annual report:</PARA>
<PARA>To present programs which will lead to positive and favourable changes in both thought and attitude through a better awareness and comprehension of other lifestyles, cultures, philosophy, history, et cetera. This properly leads to a better understanding, followed by greater understanding, and finally, to a higher level of social cohesion. </PARA>
<PARA>The chief executive of SBS, Mr Brian Johns, put it much more forcibly in a speech on 22 June 1990, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is one pivotal idea for SBS at this time then it is this: the determination to provide programs that reflect and examine multicultural Australia in ways that touch all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>And touch all Australians it does, directly through its estimated total weekly audience of 2.7 million people and indirectly in the way its programs and its audience interact with and influence other broadcasters and Australians generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Audience statistics show the quite remarkable across the board general appeal of SBS, with some 70 per cent of its weekly audience being either Australian born or born in other English-speaking countries. Yet SBS also meets its charter by achieving its highest percentage penetration of audiences among non-English speaking peoples. Some 30 per cent of this group are reached each week. Every viewer will have his or her own particular pleasures amongst SBS's programs, but I believe there would be general agreement on and particular praise for SBS's achievements with its news, current affairs and documentaries. I would like particularly to stress that aspect of SBS's programming and broadcasting. I think the news, current affairs and documentary broadcasts from SBS really do set a standard that none of the other broadcasters can match. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people might insist that SBS's exclusive coverage of World Cup soccer and its contract to do this for the next nine years should be added to that list of outstanding programs, and I agree with them. World News, Dateline and Tonight are all high quality programs. Asia Report has broken new and important ground. Documentaries such as Voices and Visions, now replaced by Cutting Edge, The Brain and Architecture at the Crossroads have generated enormous community discussion. Each week seems to produce at least one excellent film, whether a Roberto Rossellini classic, Pier Paolo Pasolini's moving masterpiece The Gospel According to Matthew, or the appealing and much awarded Australian short film Rabbit on the Moon by Monica Pellizzari. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some who do not like the title `multicultural', but whether we use that or another term it accurately describes the Australian nation of 1990. Look about in our society at the restauranteurs, bricklayers, shopkeepers, business people, members and senators of this Parliament. We are a pluralist society with enormous cultural and ethnic diversity. I grieve in this debate today because the efforts of SBS over the years have not been, in my view, sufficiently acknowledged by the Government, and I would hope that it can provide more resources for this extraordinarily successful initiative in multicultural broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> We can be proud of the way in which we have so successfully and harmoniously integrated the more than two million postwar migrants. That success can be explained in part by the unique characteristics of Australia and Australians and also in part by organisations such as SBS, which not only bring the world back home but also open a window for all Australians onto that world. In paying tribute to the work of SBS television over these 10 years we are acknowledging that its achievements are really those of the hundreds of men and women who make the countless decisions and work hard to bring SBS onto our screens in the manner and quality that it achieves. All of them deserve our gratitude and praise. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make particular mention of Sir Nicholas Shehadie, a person whom I regard with considerable pleasure as a good friend and also as a very desirable constituent in my electorate of Warringah. Sir Nicholas was appointed Chairman of SBS on 1 July 1981 and has held that position to this day. He is a very distinguished Australian, not only because of his early time as an Australian Rugby Union representative and Australian Rugby Union captain-a distinguished international rugby player-but also through his many business interests and the fact that he was Lord Mayor of Sydney. He is a most distinguished Australian with a most distinguished background in many areas, and the fact that he has contributed so much to a wide variety of community organisations should be properly acknowledged, and I believe is, by the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there can be no argument that the real potential of SBS has never been fully realised because of its sole location on the UHF band. </PARA>

Firstly, in Japan Echo for winter 1989, Mueta Tokugi, in covering general environmental questions in Japan, referred to the suppression of information in relation to contamination levels of the very toxic material dioxin. He gave an account of the way in which low levels of this very dangerous material were found in 18 of 37 fish species in 14 of the 28 areas examined. Because of fears of a decline in fish sales, that information was suppressed by the Japanese Government, despite the obvious health impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Closer to home, Sharon Beder in The Ecologist of July-August 1990 gave an account of suppression of information by the New South Wales Government. In conclusion she made the important point that `science is a resource in the political arena and those who have the best access to it and most control over it will try to determine how it is interpreted'. That comment reflected on the suppression of information from 1987 to 1989, only uncovered by the investigative reporting of the Sydney Morning Herald, of a large amount of organochlorines, metal traces, mercury, et cetera, in the water outfalls, the pollution outfalls, of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> She gives an account of the initial reports that the State Pollution Control Commission (SPCC) and the Water Board had access to that indicated benzene-hexachloride levels 122 times the recommended National Health and Medical Research Council limits-average levels, that is; some of them reached 250 times the recommended levels. She goes through the history of that revelation: the fact that meetings occurred between officers of these two departments, that they agreed that it was very dangerous to reveal this to the public because of the question of fish sales, that comments were made by the Deputy Director in September 1988, when the Herald started to get the issue off the ground, that the levels were low and not a cause of concern, the fact that the New South Wales Government refused to give this information to the Australian Underwater Federation when it demanded it, that when it brought an English professor into the debate to give endorsement, it failed to tell her that there were two actual surveys. It failed to tell her of the organochlorine levels, it failed to examine the livers of the fish involved and, as I said earlier, it cited only the mean averages rather than the extreme levels that were found on some of them. </PARA>
<PARA> That sorry tale was part of the battle between the fisheries Minister and the Minister for Environment in New South Wales, indicative of the kind of mentality of the Minister for fisheries when he very quietly tried to lift the ban on fishing that was eventually instigated after the Herald exposed the situation. When the State Minister, Mr Armstrong, eventually got it he came out with the world shattering comment that the fish were slimy on the outside and black on the inside and if people wanted to go and eat them, then that was their bad luck. That is the kind of interest in the environment and the protection of individuals that the State Government in New South Wales seems to be inclined to carry out. </PARA>
<PARA> Those surveys were suppressed and it was only under extreme public pressure that they hit the agenda. It was only through the efforts of the Herald that after 1 1/2 years in some cases the reports became public. People were given some knowledge of the threat they faced and people who went out fishing actually had some protection. It is obviously of grave concern when people take it on themselves to decide when information might cause public alarm or scare the public on these kinds of issues and suppress the information. </PARA>
<PARA> This is timely for two reasons: Firstly, the Sydney Morning Herald report of this morning says that the State Government of New South Wales will review the Environmental Offences and Penalties Act. That was the outstanding monument to the Minister for Environment. At the time he made a number of gung ho statements about the massive increase in fines. He ignored the State Opposition's point that it is all right to have fines, but people have to be prosecuted and the Government has to succeed in gaining convictions. In that Act, of course, these very heavy fines were accompanied by a very difficult question of proof. He is saying today that unfortunately the State Opposition was correct on this very crucial issue and that the degree of wilful intention, the degree of negligence that has to be shown against people or organisations such as ICI has been impossible to meet in prosecutions and that the Government will have to amend the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is timely because of recent events on the Parramatta River, which forms the boundary between my electorate and the electorate of Parramatta. It also affects the tributary, the Duck River, that divides my electorate. In a manner similar to that which I indicated about sewage outfalls, the Minister for Environment has refused to go public with vital information because a recent SPCC survey which measured the fish between Duck River and the Iron Cove Bridge in Sydney showed high levels of toxins in the fish at Homebush Bay. Four weeks later, he is still refusing to give access to this information to the shadow Minister in New South Wales and the public. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, we have had some other interesting sidelines to this issue. He has apparently found it world shattering and extremely difficult to put up signs warning people of his decision to ban commercial fishing as a result of these toxin levels. He said that he cannot get around to it because too many departments are involved: the Department of Corrective Services makes the signs and the environment Department and the fisheries Department are involved. Despite all the demographic surveys, all the money that New South Wales and Australian taxpayers pay, all the work by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, he cannot decide how many languages the sign should be put up in. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have had a lack of consultation with local councils. Auburn Council was given 12 hours notice of a meeting about this whole issue and about what it was going to do in its area. I also express concern that the ban affects only commercial anglers and that it will last only six months, although I guess the average person in the street and the recreational fishermen have been given some warnings, despite the fact that, apparently, we do not need to know the full details and despite the fact that councils do not need to be properly consulted. It has actually been said that recreational anglers should not eat fish from the Parramatta River more than twice a month; so that is a very helpful contribution. That at least is something. </PARA>
<PARA> We do know that apparently the levels of the toxins are about four times the safe health standard level. Of course, this springs from earlier surveys-September 1989 around Homebush Bay, the infamous Union Carbide site at Rhodes-which even then indicated some concern with pollution levels in that region. I think there have been some very interesting comments on this issue. The State spokesman for the State Pollution Control Commission came out with the brilliant contribution that people have been eating the fish for years. What is he saying? Is he saying that the contamination has been there all that time? That is the kind of contribution he has made as the public watchdog in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> After making the fairly contradictory statement that there is no trouble, that people have been eating the fish for years, he went on to say, `We were suspicious before but now we have the data and now we know there are toxins in Homebush Bay'. So once again, what is he actually saying? Is he saying that there is no danger, that it is safe to eat the fish? He has been seeking this data and the position has now been established. As I say, this is a continuation of a policy of suppressing vital public health information. It is information that is relevant to the pollution controls in New South Wales; it is relevant to industry and its responsibilities. I think it is very disconcerting that the State Government pursues these policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Business expenditure on research and development continues to be at an appalling level in Australia relative to other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, so much so that we languish at the very low level of sixteenth amongst 19 OECD nations in terms of business research and development spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, Australia spends 0.52 per cent of gross domestic product on research and development, which is far below the spending of countries such as the United States-at almost 2 per cent of GDP, Switzerland at 2.2 per cent, Germany at 2.08 per cent, Japan at 1.98 per cent and the United Kingdom at 1.48 per cent. I give some examples of some of the failures of business to take up the intellectual property that has been developed at the laboratory bench. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, some of the examples I will give have found their way, under licence agreements, to overseas companies. Probably the best known is gene shears, which has been a development within the division of plant industry of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Gene shears is best described as molecular scissors. It provides a means of switching off undesirable genes. It has commercial applications for veterinary science and plant and animal production. It enables control of plant diseases or will make plants resistant to previously unfavourable climatic conditions. In animals it will provide a means of overcoming diseases such as Newcastle disease in poultry or foot and mouth disease in cattle. It will also increase the fertility of stud livestock. It actually has application in the fermentation processes for cheese making and brewing because it might control viral contamination of bacterial cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, CSIRO has found it necessary to enter into a $22.5m joint venture with the French seed company Limograin. Other examples can be taken from the Division of Radiophysics in CSIRO. The gallium arsenide chip is likely to go to an overseas company. This chip is made up of new material for the coating of a computer chip which allows the chip to process a great deal more information. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking now at the CSIRO Division of Entomology, much of the funding for that division's biocontrol programs to find alternatives to chemicals has been taken on by the United States company Dupont. To take a pharmaceutical example, let us look at the Division of Human Nutrition within CSIRO. Here, an insulin program with implications for animal production and the pharmaceutical industry will go to a US company under licence. This is a program for devising a method of artificially deriving insulin which causes muscle tissue to regenerate at a rapid rate. Consequently, this program has implications for rehabilitation of, say, human burns victims. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite obvious, therefore, that a great many opportunities are being lost to Australian businesses. I know there are huge restraints to change but we cannot be overwhelmed by them. Industry has to look to its future. Leaving aside the poor investment climate and the inherent structural weaknesses of the manufacturing sector in Australia, there is also the problem of attitudes. We have to change the attitudes of many people within both the business and the research and development communities. Part of that is going to involve CSIRO, which so often misses out on commercialising its breakthroughs, discoveries and inventions. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, it has come to my attention that a lot of the free flow of information that may bring about cultural changes in attitudes in the business and research and development communities has been stunted by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean). CSIRO officers have contacted me to show me documents that they are required to fill in whenever they have contact with a parliamentarian. The Minister for Science and Technology has forwarded two documents to CSIRO officers in which they are required to state all of the details of their contacts with parliamentarians. They have to identify the parliamentarian and outline the nature of the inquiry and the location and nature of the contact. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt this could be seen as a justifiable exercise by the Minister if he had been interested in monitoring the interaction of the CSIRO with the wider community. It would be justifiable if it had been designed to evaluate the flow of information from the CSIRO into the public domain. In short, it would be justifiable if the requirement had been designed to bolster CSIRO's growing commitment to communicating more vigorously than in the past the role of science and technology. But it is not. The whole exercise is targeted at politicians. No reporting is required in regard to media inquiries or inquiries from the general public-just from politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a passive information gathering exercise upon which to better judge CSIRO's public communications processes. It is a selective, crafted, insidious means of intimidating CSIRO officers and keeping a running surveillance of those who might have the arrogance of mind to disagree with the Minister. Essentially, it is an attempt to intimidate CSIRO officers and to discourage their contact with parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology brings the mentality of the closed shop to his portfolio. This is how bullying shop stewards conduct the affairs of state. The document discloses the environment of mistrust and infighting characteristic of the trade union movement. It reveals an unprecedented lack of confidence and a profound mistrust in those very individuals whose intellectual commitments have never previously been questioned. It represents an abrogation, a rejection, of his predecessor's active encouragement of the scientific and technological community to enter into a wider dialogue with the community. The document attests to the fact that the Minister has brought to his portfolio the standover tactics and intimidatory policies of his trade union days. </PARA>

Honourable members will recall the Minister's reply to a question without notice on August 21 of this year concerning his explanation as to why he boycotted the conference organised by the Masters Builders Association. The reason was simple. The Minister freely admitted to the House that he snubbed the conference because other speakers on the agenda did not share his views. That is how the Minister treats major employer organisations who have the temerity to disagree with his views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The same tendencies were in evidence when he overrode the Public Service appointment of the announced head of the Office of the Chief Scientist, Dr John Bell. The decision was not one for the Minister, it was a Public Service appointment and it had already been publicly announced. The Minister discarded the Westminster tradition in this instance. He forced another appointment-someone who would agree with him. This is the same explicitly authoritarian, openly antidemocratic conduct that forces disclosure requirements upon the officers of the CSIRO. Never before in the conduct of the portfolio of science and technology have we seen a Minister who has attempted to gag the officers of the CSIRO. </PARA>

These are the sort of people who want to stamp on everybody else's rights. Because I have only a short time I will just allude to the remarks of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who has just spoken. This is the sort of unproductive beat-up we are getting from the Opposition. It is my view that the greatest problem facing Australia is the lack of industry policy, and I do not shy away from the view that the Labor Party's policy on industry is totally inadequate. Yet it does at least have a policy, which is more than can be said for the Opposition parties. What the honourable member was talking about is a long-standing arrangement that applies to all public servants. There is nothing particularly new in it and I do not think it has ever inhibited anyone at the CSIRO. I constantly contact the people at the CSIRO and I have never had any inhibition at all from their officers about supplying me with information in great detail on any aspect of any inquiry that I have made.</PARA></TALK.START>

To talk about bully boys in the trade union movement inhibiting the flow of information is absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not uncritical of the trade union movement, or sections of the trade union movement, and I was one of the people who spoke very strongly for the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF). I see the BLF as a bunch of thugs and I said at the time of the debate that it was appropriate that its flag was the Eureka flag. Far from being the flag of the workers, the Eureka flag was the flag adopted by an elitist section of the Victorian community who wanted to add even more privilege to the privileges they already enjoyed. It is noteworthy that they were put down by a largely working class police and military, who understood exactly what they were about. </PARA>
<PARA> I just say in conclusion that I think the shadow Minister for science and technology would make a far more useful contribution to this debate if he were to put forward some proper initiatives that would enable industry in this country to get going and achieve for us the promise that industry holds and has never delivered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of us in this House are aware of the readiness of the Australian public to criticise, even castigate, their politicians for their adherence to what is commonly called the party line, presumably forsaking all else. Members of the Parliament, it is argued, are unable to properly represent their constituents because they are compelled to put party loyalty first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I offer no excuses for those willing to criticise, let me draw their attention to a recent article by Laurie Oakes in the 16 October edition of the Bulletin with which I heartily agree. Oakes draws a comparison between the gutless opportunism of the United States Congress and the failure of American politicians to grapple honestly with their growing economic problems and the courage and frankness of Australian politicians who are at least willing to confront their electorates with unpalatable remedies for Australia's economic crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The pork-barrelling of members of the US Congress, who so willingly put their constituents first, means that whilst incumbents are rarely defeated, important economic policies remain unaltered. Little wonder that we read in today's newspapers that incumbents in the US House of Representatives enjoyed 100 per cent return to office, while 98 per cent of those in the Senate were similarly re-elected. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, President Bush's attack on the nation's recently revised deficit of $US297 billion has largely been unsuccessful due to the unwillingness of congressmen and senators to confront their electorates with unpopular spending cuts.

It was by common acclaim the best organised grand prix held this year in the formula one circuit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to comment today on micro-economic reform. It is a buzz word that is in the community and I have no doubt that micro-economic reform can make some substantial increases to our efficiency and to business profitability. However, I often think we look in the wrong areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It amuses me that we spend so much time agonising over our ports, which are increasingly becoming better, with the exception, I might say, of Sydney. But we do not look at what is happening in our legal system where we are going more and more down the American road of litigation. If we allow Australia to go down that American litigation road, the cost to business and to the community is going to be horrendous. It will be in money terms far in excess of any other area of micro-economic reform that I can think of. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that revamping the ports and making them totally productive will save Australia $1 billion. If so, that is very good, and I certainly applaud it. But lack of English in the workplace is costing Australia $3 billion. This is a problem which should be very easy to tackle. We are not tackling it primarily because of this crazy notion of multiculturalism. This is basically the thing stopping us getting a standard for English in the community. It is my view that the level of standard English in the community is less today than it was 10 years ago, and this is greatly to be deplored. Certainly it must work against the micro-economic reforms that everyone purports to want. </PARA>

It would be fair to say that the overall tenor of the convention with its protection against child sexual abuse, exploitation, slavery, et cetera, is supported by these ordinary people, but Articles 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are causing them enormous concern.

This is wonderful news for both black and white Australians and goes a long way towards rectifying a gross misrepresentation of Australian history whereby Aborigines, their entire traditions and their part in our history in Australia have been completely neglected and written out of Australian history.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I believe this House should be concerned that Australia is becoming a repository for the dumping of the world's surplus agricultural products. It seems incredible that in a nation that is basically an agricultural producer that at any given time there are some $2 billion worth of imported agricultural products on our supermarket shelves; in fact, I understand that some 34 per cent of all our imports are agricultural products.</PARA></TALK.START>

The consumer is being deceived and the agricultural producer is being disadvantaged by unnecessary and unsuccessful labelling arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in what is Melbourne Cup week, I raise an issue that arises out of the prosecution by the jockey Malcolm Johnston in the New South Wales Supreme Court and then the subsequent appeals courts where he was fined $120,000 for what was claimed to be dangerous riding. It has implications for other sport, in particular Australian Rules football and Rugby League. I draw to the attention of administrators such as Mr Ross Oakley in Melbourne that unless there is a proper system of legal coverage for players, we could find clubs and players facing the same action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are aware that there is a matter involving Rodney Grinter and Terry Wallace that will be before the court shortly. But the matter is important, and I say to all sports administrators that the Malcolm Johnston case should be seen as a precedent setter in terms of likely damages actions that may be taken by other participants in a sport in the case of injury. The solution is very straightforward, in fact. We can provide a common pool of cover rather than use the procedures adopted for motor vehicles. I have talked to government insurance offices around Australia and there would be a capability of providing a common pool of cover for such a circumstance. I believe it is imperative that sports such as Rugby League and Australian Rules football look at this as a matter of priority to prevent really substantial damages being awarded against players and other competitors. </PARA>

When any of us imports an item into this country for private or business purposes, we have a choice. We can do it ourselves or we can use an agent. If we do it ourselves it means that we have to know all the rules, know where to go, with all the time that is involved, and so I think most of us tend to use an agent. Unfortunately, if that agent makes an error it is the owner who is held responsible for his actions. The penalty provisions of section 243t of the Act require that the owner pay the penalty and not the agent who made the error.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have consulted with the office of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) and I am advised that this is done on the assumption that the declaration of the agent is deemed to be done with the knowledge and consent of the owner. But even if the Australian Customs Service knows that the agent was at fault, the penalty is still served on the agent, and the only recourse of action for the innocent owner is the courts. If he goes to the courts, of course, there can be a lot of negative consequences even if he wins. It is costly, it is time consuming, and there is a high price, I would suggest, to pay for one's own innocence and the pursuit of justice. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that customs agents have little accountability for their actions. The owner can give them the correct information, the agent makes an error, and the presumption of guilt is still on the owner. Obviously the guilty agent evades his responsibility. I have a constituent who has suffered in just this way. I believe that it is a complete lack of natural justice and is unacceptable in Australia in the 1990s. I urge the Minister to rectify the matter. </PARA>

It is an appeal to Royal Australian Navy personnel not to serve on ships going to the Persian Gulf. It is put out by a group called the Bring the Frigates Home Coalition, with a post office box number and a phone number in Sydney. I spent all yesterday trying to ring this phone number and on no occasion did it answer, so I wonder just how serious this group is.</PARA></TALK.START>

I believe that these people are probably a group of `Trots' who would take any opportunity to cause dissent in the Australian community. I believe they will fail.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition does seem to get himself into a lot of trouble on this matter, but of course he will have the opportunity of dealing with this in more detail at the press conference he is going to have this afternoon. It is a Clayton's press conference; it is the sort of press conference you have when you are not having a press conference because, would you believe, the instruction has gone out from the office of the Leader of the Opposition to the Press Gallery, `Yes, I am going to have a press conference, but you cannot have television cameras and you cannot have recorders'. I wonder whether the cartoonists will be allowed. Remarkable!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made the position on this quite clear. I said earlier this week that all I have said before on this question is that as far as the economists and the profession of economics are concerned there is technically a recession when there are two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. I repeated in this House what I said earlier. I am not trying to hide behind the economists' definition. I have acknowledged that there is pain in the economy. That has been brought about because this Government had the guts to accept the responsibility of taking the tough decisions that were necessary to confront a situation where we had an 8 per cent increase in consumption and a 4 per cent increase in production. If we had not been prepared to have a tough monetary policy, there would have emerged in this country a solution imposed upon it from abroad which would have been infinitely more damning in its impact.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of that we have had a slowing down in activity and we have had a reflection of that situation in the employment and unemployment figures. But I remind the House of what I said earlier on this matter when talking about the position now compared to that in 1982-83. In that period it was the case that employment fell by 2.6 per cent over five consecutive quarters. The loss of employment that occurred in that situation is simply not being reflected at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Leader of the Opposition again-he ought to be reminded every time he opens his mouth on this issue-that in 1982-83 there was a massive recession accompanied by a wages explosion, a 17 per cent increase in nominal wages. That was a situation with which the Leader of the Opposition was associated. He was an economic adviser to the Government at that time. So it ill behoves the Leader of the Opposition to get up now, when we have nothing like a repetition of the unemployment disaster which his policies inflicted upon the country with a 17 per cent wage explosion, and criticise the policies of this Government, which are bringing about now the fifth consecutive quarter of lowering inflation. What he did was produce simultaneously what no-one had ever been able to do before: double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. When he looks back on his achievement he ought to be ashamed even to open his mouth on the subject of what is happening at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA> We do not resile from the fact that there has been pain, that the employment situation has tightened, but if we had not taken the action that we have then, as we say, the rest of the world would have imposed on this country a solution which would have been infinitely more damaging.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday's consumer price index increase of 0.7 per cent provides Australia with an opportunity to procure a major step down in inflation. This has eluded the country for more than two decades. Only once since the June quarter of 1971 has inflation fallen below 6 per cent and that was in the March quarter of 1985. Under this Government inflation has averaged 7.5 per cent compared with the dismal 10.3 per cent over the Fraser years. This is a testimony to the accord and the success it has had in lowering inflation while dealing with the dramatic terms of trade shifts which occurred in the period when that lowering took place; that is, we had that dramatic fall in income in 1985-86 and the big swing back in 1987-88, this big shift in our international income. We now have an opportunity to do much better and, under accord mark 6, provide for a wage adjustment equivalent to a CPI increase in the September quarter. That adjustment will now be 0.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important point is that because inflation is lower, wages have to rise by a smaller amount to maintain their real value. I say in passing that that is why I thought some of the headlines in today's tabloids were so irresponsible in announcing smaller wage increases in the light of the lower CPI outcome. We had the Sydney Daily Telegraph Mirror greeting the lowest quarterly inflation outcome since 1971 with, `Your pay rise cut to $4'. The headline is not even correct.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The story starts out:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Workers will receive a pay rise of only $4 a week before Christmas after a surprisingly low rate of inflation in the September quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>The 0.7 per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index, to which wage rises are linked, was bad news for workers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, high inflation is good news for workers because they get a bigger increase! The Sydney Daily Telegraph Mirror ought to hang its head in shame over that one.</PARA>
<PARA> It was not much better in the Herald-Sun. It had the headline,`Brawl Over $4 Pay Rise Lower CPI Cuts Claim'. This is a paper with a circulation of 650,000. It reported:</PARA>
<PARA>Unions are expected to push for ``catch-up'' allowances to counter a Christmas pay rise half of what they expected.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the only value these two papers have seen from a lower inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that this is not true of the press in general. Mr Colebatch of the Age said that ultimately September's low CPI increase is great news for workers, too. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>It gives Australia a rare opportunity to shift inflation and interest rates permanently down to a lower level-making life easier for its people, and the economy more competitive with its trading rivals. With self-discipline on all sides, it is now possible for inflation to be ground back to 1960s levels within two or three years . . . It is the job of business to ensure that yesterday's low inflation figure is the first of many. It is the job of unions to ensure that they have no excuse for failing.</PARA>
<PARA>Well said! Mr Burton in the Sydney Morning Herald said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is now a real chance of Australia emerging from its crisis with a healthy, if not spectacular, growth rate and with an inflation rate not seen since the early seventies.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, well said! Michael Stutchbury of the Australian Financial Review again had another reasonably accurate reflection of events but said at the end:</PARA>
<PARA>A possible alternative world is provided by Mrs Thatcher's Britain where, despite an economy teetering on the edge of recession, wage inflation is chasing price inflation, which has bubbled up towards 11 per cent following the Gulf crisis.</PARA>
<PARA>That is dead right too. The underlying rate of yesterday's figure was 0.8. I remind the House that the underlying rate calculation-that is, a series which the Treasury has kept together for a number of years-excludes food and petrol. To the extent that some people focused on the shift in food and petrol prices in the quarter, the underlying rate was 0.8. This is again the lowest figure since the June quarter of 1971.</PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the fall was also recognised yesterday in the financial markets when the long term bond rate was reduced by half a percentage point. The 10-year bond rate was down to 12 3/4 per cent. Yesterday the treasury note tender came in with bids down from 12.6 per cent last week to 12 per cent yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that obviously lower inflation over time will allow Australia to have lower rates of interest, which will mean that the prospects for 1991 will therefore be very much better as we look at the prospect of lower interest rates and more activity built upon a declining level of inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> This is very good news for the country. Some papers have said so, particularly those which have lectured the Government for so long about the evils of inflation; one acknowledges that. But for those tabloid papers which do not seem to know which way is up, we can only say that it is time that they did something about either their staff or their editors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister said, today's figures show that the number of employed persons fell by 10,300 since September, but employment was still 51,400 higher than a year earlier. That has moved the registered unemployment rate up to 7.6 per cent from 7.4 per cent. Again, I remind the House that that is with the participation rate steady at this very high level of 63.9 per cent. Generally, in a slower economy some of that participation rate falls. Therefore, one would expect, if not now then later, an adjustment in that registered rate flowing from the figures we have had to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that some States are affected more than others, but again I think that the Leader of the National Party trivialised the point by referring to Victoria and other States as Labor Inc. States, that being the reason why unemployment was at desperate levels in these places.</PARA>
<PARA> I said in the House and I will say it again: it is true that morale in the State of Victoria is, inexplicably, at very low levels. Victoria is the traded goods State of Australia. Almost all of this year's growth in gross domestic product is coming from net exports as the economy switches from domestic demand to exports. The State most likely to be wearing some of the benefits of that is, obviously, the State which has the largest base in the traded goods sector-that is, Victoria.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. As he well knows, the coal industry is now our major export industry. Our value of exports were up $2 billion on the year before for the year ended 1989-90. What has characterised the coal industry in recent times has been the willingness on behalf of miners and their union, the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia (UMFA), to engage in very serious and complex negotiations on structural change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, I was literally at the coalface, talking with the mine workers about what has happened to that industry with the Coal Industry Tribunal (CIT) and rosters, union amalgamation, award restructuring, multiskilling, structural efficiency principles, training and retraining, even incidental and peripheral measures-all the things that the union has engaged in, never getting any sort of thanks from anyone. There has been massive micro-economic reform in that industry and never a word of praise from honourable members opposite, who seem to think that this is all very easy for people actually at the workface.</PARA>
<PARA> In that industry there is a fair amount of frustration at present as all these changes have filtered through. The miners and their representatives understand that productivity increases are essential for this premier export industry and really they have been very diligent in their consideration of these real issues. Honourable members should not pretend that these issues are easy. Those whose analysis is driven by an examination of the facts rather than wild imagination will understand that productivity is a responsibility of both management and labour. So it is a matter of concern to the Government and to the honourable member for Macarthur. I know that a dispute at the Coalcliff colliery in the southern districts has the potential to assume a wider significance, and there is discussion now of a national stoppage.</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to point out that industrial relations should not solely be described in terms of the failure in some way of the work force or the union involved, and in this case management behaviour is just as relevant-one does not hear the sound of one hand clapping. The Government fully understands that stoppages in such a major export industry are never helpful. Threats of legal action have the potential to exacerbate rather than advance the issue and the Government always believes that negotiations by the parties is a more fruitful process.</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to put on record that I applaud the efforts of the honourable member for Macarthur, who is working to pull together the parties involved and negotiate a meaningful resolution. As a final note, in terms of export availability, due to all the work of the unions and management, stocks are high. This is a result of increased productivity, increased production and, as I said, the very constructive attitude of the UMFA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question, which went to short and longer term considerations. I correct the honourable member on one point. He inferred or suggested that there was no commitment on the part of the Government to Badgerys Creek. In the longer term, there is a commitment. In the shorter term, clearly, the Government has under consideration the recent environmental impact report with respect to the Kingsford-Smith Airport. So there is the question of short and longer term considerations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the Government's approach to some of the social justice issues that are implied, of course, the same might be said-that is, we are concerned about issues of locational disadvantage and, as part of the social justice strategy, we have put in place a number of studies around Australia, in each of the States, which will consider issues of disadvantage, whether they are in inner city areas such as the inner area of the Sydney or in some of the outer areas referred to by the honourable member for North Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to see that people on my side of the House take these questions seriously. I thank the honourable member for his question. It could equally well have been addressed to the Minister for Resources because many of the achievements and ongoing initiatives are his. Mineral commodities now contribute greatly to our total export revenue. The figure is now about 41 or 42 per cent. As I said in answer to an earlier question, the Government's comprehensive program of micro-economic reform will further drive efficiency gains in our mineral and energy sector, particularly in the area of resource taxation. By doing this, the competitiveness of our commodity sector in tough world markets is further enhanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been looking at all this. The current State-based regimes of resource taxation in general are little more than ad hoc revenue grabs and they impede our export efforts. I instance the petroleum industry because, as a result of the Budget, we now have the most efficient and equitable resource taxation regime in offshore areas under Commonwealth control. Because of this, we believe oil exploration and production will naturally move to our offshore areas. The Minister for Resources just broke the news that we have record drilling offshore this year. The States will be faced with a declining onshore exploration effort and possibly a declining revenue take.</PARA>
<PARA> Given this sort of record and the initiatives we have put in place, some of the Opposition's recent comments are rather extraordinary. For example, the Opposition spokesman for energy and resources said that `the need exists to examine the whole picture, including the impact of the RRT on gas for the first time'. The spokesman is advocating a half resource rent tax-or that is the kindest interpretation one could put on this comment.</PARA>

He possibly believes, in this whole area of taxation, that a consumption tax on the poor, the aged and the disadvantaged is the best way of ensuring that the community benefits from mineral development. Despite the statements of the Opposition spokesman for primary industries and the economically illiterate shadow Minister for energy and resources, the Opposition does not have a policy position. It is all just a bit too hard for it. A consistent, sensible resource taxation regime actually requires hard work and a degree of intellectual rigour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present the Federal coalition is simultaneously and incredibly advocating HRRT, that is, a half resource rent tax, according to the Leader of the National Party of Australia; NRRT, that is, no resource rent tax, according to the Opposition spokesman on primary industries; and WRRT, that is, what resource rent tax, according to the Leader of the Opposition. I think he should have the courage to reprimand the unreconstructed rural populace who are making Opposition policy in this critical policy area. It is basically a Dewey, Louie and Huey policy prescription. And this mob opposite reckon that they are going to get a consumption tax up and running!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the sort of simple notion which the Opposition has about Budget forecasts. Budget forecasts are an attempt by the Treasury to forecast the shape of the economy over the ensuing year, not only to provide information to the community generally about what the Treasury believes the prospects for the economy are, but also to develop assumptions upon which estimates can be based for the purposes of the Budget figuring. This is true in a number of areas and it is also true in relation to unemployment benefit recipients (UBRs).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not a matter of saying that if a forecast appears to be overshot or undershot, a whole lot of new forecasts have to be done. That is not the point at all and we never publish another set of forecasts in the course of the year. Occasionally, the Prime Minister and I say something about these issues. As has happened in a number of years, if the current account forecast or the inflation forecast have been overshot, we say so. I have not seen the latest numbers from the Department of Social Security in terms of UBRs, but the best guide to the economy in terms of the unemployed is today's figures, the labour force figures, which give a better general guide to the economy. The Budget is a series of ons and offs throughout the year. Some numbers will be over and some will be under. If the honourable member is asking where I think the Budget surplus stands, it stands at least at the forecast number, or better.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an important step. Professor Gust has been at the Fairfield Hospital for 20 years and has held a number of positions. He has played one of the leading roles in the area of research, particularly in the area of virology. He has been one of the critical researchers, as I referred to yesterday, with respect to the HIV infection. He has moved to take up a new position at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories on Monday next week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hospital is currently seeking a replacement in his role of Director of Virology while Dr Elizabeth Dax is to become the new director of the national HIV reference laboratory. I would be joined by all members of parliament in paying tribute to Professor Gust's long and distinguished service at Fairfield Hospital and wish him every success in his new position.</PARA>
<PARA> To the question of the steps that the Government is taking to ensure that we have an approach which prevents outbreak of major infections, honourable members may be aware that the Government announced in the Budget major changes to the Australian system of communicable disease reporting. These improvements will see the development of a far more effective and cohesive communicable disease surveillance system and in the spirit exemplified by the recent Special Premiers Conference on a truly national basis with the full cooperation of all State and Territory health departments.</PARA>
<PARA> Until now, with the exception of quarantine, the control of communicable diseases, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, malaria and hydatids, has been a State responsibility. Information on the number of notifiable diseases is only being supplied to the communicable diseases section of my Department every three months. Besides information being three months out of date there has also been until now no agreed list of notifiable diseases on a national basis. Nor has any information in addition to the number of reported cases been collected.</PARA>
<PARA> By adopting a national approach to disease control we accept the obvious fact that diseases do not recognise State or territory borders and uncommon diseases, such as legionnaires disease, may not be recognised as a problem if viewed only from the perspective of a single State or territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The new computerised system will include national collection, analysis and dissemination of information, coordination of responses by government and health professionals to epidemic as well as endemic problems, and the training of public health professional staff. A national system of communicable disease reporting by general practitioners will overcome the present problem of underreporting of vaccine preventable diseases, allowing for the development of ongoing control and eradication strategies on a systematic basis.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Fairfield Hospital and, in particular, Dr Gust have played a critical role in being able to respond to major crises such as that related to HIV infections. Fundamentally, if we are to build a system in the future that will protect the health of all Australians we need to be able to take concrete steps to get the Commonwealth and the States working together as part of a national approach. The information in the answer to the question that I have just sought to give to the honourable member for Chifley may not be in a sense very exciting. It is the stuff of which cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States will need to be built-important initiatives that mean that for the first time we develop systems on a national basis which will not only mean greater efficiency but will enhance the health and the quality of life for all Australians.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, let me say that I have not seen the comments of the Minister to which the honourable member for Bennelong refers, but I believe that we ought to understand that over the last seven years the Australian work force has exercised an enormous degree of restraint which, unfortunately, has never been recognised by those opposite, including the honourable gentleman who asked the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind him and the House of the measure of restraint that has been exercised by Australian workers. In the period since 1983, there has been a 10 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs. Nothing like it has been seen before; and in a situation, too, when it is known and recognised by major employer organisations in this country, as well as by individual employers, that if workers and their organisations had seen fit to exercise the undoubted industrial power they had in buoyant economic conditions, they could have pushed wages through the roof. They did not; they were prepared to operate under the accord. With that 10 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs, of course, as I think the honourable gentleman would realise-I do not think he would argue this point-the other side of that coin has been a massive change in national income shares from wages to profits.</PARA>
<PARA> The trade union movement has gone into this with its eyes open and knowing the necessity of getting a change in the shares if we were to get the investment needed to help participate in the basic restructuring of the Australian economy. I find it distasteful that, in this sort of situation that we are confronted with, the proposition is put that it is the workers who have, in some way or another, not been pulling their weight, not playing their part. I do not know what the Australian workers and their organisations could have been expected to do in this period. Is a 10 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs not enough? Has the massive move from wages to profits, which has seen record levels of investment in this country in the last two years, not played its part?</PARA>
<PARA> This particular aspect of workers' remuneration has become well established through the industrial relations system. It may be that if we were starting afresh, if we were trying today to determine a pattern of remuneration, both in respect of wages and other conditions of employment, we would not in fact have this condition or this condition in this form. But the fact is that restraint has been exercised in the major area of wages, and the underlying assumption about this attack upon a particular condition of employment is that, in some way or another, it is the workers who have been at fault.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts are of course that, as against the restraint that the workers have exercised, to which I have referred, Australian executives simply have not shown the same restraint. A survey of salary packages for members of senior management in private enterprises shows that their base salaries increased by 90 per cent over the six years to 1990. That is a real increase of 20.8 per cent. The workers have been prepared to suffer a real reduction, compensated to a considerable extent by improvements in the social wage, which is the very essence of the accord process of accepted improvements in the social wage. They have been prepared to assist their employers by not having their monetary remuneration increased in a way that would add unduly to costs.</PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that I think you, Mr Speaker, will appreciate the distaste with which I and my colleagues view these propositions that are put up that it is really the workers who are not doing the right thing. Every objective piece of analysis shows that the Australian workers and their organisations have made a historic contribution to growth in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that in many respects the honourable member for Bennelong is prepared to look at these things with a degree of objectivity. But I ask the honourable member for Bennelong directly how it is that under this Government we have had a rate of employment increase five times faster than under his Government. The answer very simply is, and I think the honourable member for Bennelong knows it, that the reason we have had a five times higher rate of employment growth than under his period in office is that, in response to the position that we have offered of cooperation-instead of confrontation which was his prescription-the workers have been prepared to exercise this massive restraint. It is in those circumstances generally that we reject this approach which is based upon the assumption of a non-responsible attitude by the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, if the honourable gentleman wishes to speak with my colleague Senator Cook, the Minister for Industrial Relations, I would welcome that. It would be consistent with my whole approach to these sorts of things. If out of that discussion there could possibly emerge some basis of commonality in the future in regard to how we approach this question of industrial relations, I for one would welcome it because I believe that the more we can get common ground on these issues of fundamental importance in this country, so much the better. So I would welcome any discussion that the honourable member for Bennelong would like to have with Senator Cook. But I say that I do not want any discussions between him and Senator Cook, or any debate on this issue, to be in any way falsely premised. Any discussion is falsely premised which suggests that Australian workers and their organisations have not responsibly played their part in enabling record employment growth in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. His election to this Parliament represents one of the acknowledgments of our efforts in this important respect. We have taken very seriously the issue of how we can ensure that all young people throughout Australia, regardless of their geographic location, have as near as possible regular and equal access to schooling. We are aware of the fact that rural participation rates, certainly in higher education, have been lower than they are for the population as a whole. For that reason we have provided a considerable amount of funds-about $20m-to increase the amount of student accommodation in order to provide more opportunities for those who obviously have to move away from home in order to attend a university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it goes much further than that. We have also provided a special program of $6.8m for hostel accommodation for those teenagers at high school because for many there are very few choices other than going right away to capital cities and to boarding schools once one's kids have to attend high schools in the country. Through our program of student hostels we have increased the number of new places by 170 and provided for the upgrading of a further 83 places; and, of course, the program continues, with another $2m still to be expended. We have also changed the taxation arrangements to ensure that contributions to the building of hostels are tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a decision that was taken by the Government yesterday and announced today by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and Senator Richardson relating to, amongst other things, the arrangements for Austudy and assistance for isolated children. I preface my remarks by saying that in the Budget we took the decision to increase by $521 a year to $1,500 the amount paid, on a means test free basis, in assistance for isolated children in respect of those kids who have to move away from home in order to attend school. It is a very important measure, particularly to those who live in remote Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, as a result of a Cabinet meeting yesterday, we have decided to revisit the question of the assets test arrangements in relation to the family allowance, family allowance supplement, Austudy and assistance for isolated children. The House will be aware that it was announced in the Budget that an assets test of $300,000 would be introduced in respect of the family allowance. This has now been amended to $500,000.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the other assets tests, we have taken the decision to increase the amount of assets which families may have before they are affected by these tests under the family allowance supplement and the student assistance programs from the existing level of about $322,000 to $347,000.</PARA>
<PARA> I should make the point that under the student assistance programs there is more generous treatment for working assets, where there is a 50 per cent concession. That means that in effect the amount of working assets-and I make the point that these are the net value of working assets-will be nearly $700,000 before there is any effect on the eligibility for Austudy or assistance to isolated children.</PARA>
<PARA> What is recognised here is that the education of children and the education of young people is a top priority for all Australians-one which is recognised by this Government. We recognise the special problems confronted by those who live outside the metropolitan areas and indeed distant from even large country towns, and we believe there is a very good reason for providing incentives for the children of farmers so they may in fact continue their education through to year 12 and then, where they are able, continue their education in universities and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason particularly that we have taken these decisions, and as a result of the decisions we announced today some 10,500 students will benefit other than from the arrangements that had been previously announced.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is very concrete and tangible evidence of the concern this Government has for educational equality regardless of where people live in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and at a later stage today we shall have the opportunity to debate this more fully, which I am looking forward to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me address the specific aspects of the question because what it underlines is the fact that the honourable member for Barker just does not understand the difference between moving away from tariff protection and developing a strategy by which we become more globally oriented, by which we grow exports, and by which we encourage innovation. If he is really saying the Government should not give support in any form to any one of those initiatives, let him get up and say it, and he will have the opportunity in this House today to say that.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer indicated in this House yesterday, this Government-and the honourable member's former Government, for that matter-on many occasions has engaged in forms of what might be described as intervention. What about the steel plan? What about the automotive industry plan? What about the factor F initiatives? What about the information technology initiatives? What about the bounty capitalisation? In the honourable member's simplistic definition all of those could be determined as intervention. The reality is that they are all effective mechanisms for doing two things: getting a stronger commitment in this country to innovation, research and development, which the honourable member's former Government ran down. When I answered a question in this House on Tuesday, all the former Government was able to register from business contributions to research and development was something like 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). We have taken it to 0.5 per cent. If there is no encouragement to research and development, there is none to innovation. The Opposition's shadow Minister in this regard says that the Government should vacate the field completely so far as innovation is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> That is one area in which the Government's direction of policy has been encouraging. The other has been to get growth of net exports. If the honourable member had listened to my answer to the question about the steel industry asked the other day by the honourable member for MacKellar, he would understand the success of the steel plan in getting growth of net exports, because a significantly higher proportion of output is going to exports. The Opposition's policy, on the other hand, would have seen the closure of two steelworks in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> All I am saying is that the honourable member ought to get the facts right. He ought to understand properly what this Government is saying. Neither the Treasurer nor the Minister for Employment, Education and Training have said we should return to the circumstances and the policies that the Opposition created. We are totally opposed to going back to the protectionist policy demonstrated by the tariff approach. What we are saying is that we need a clear perspective. We are undertaking that in the context of both the Garnaut and Pappas-Carter report and as a consequence of that the Government will make a statement on industry policy at the appropriate time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Burke for his question. Some of these issues were in fact canvassed by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, so I will not traverse that ground again. Let me simply inform the House that a record annual level of offshore oil exploration activity was achieved in September 1990. This was an all-time high for offshore exploratory drilling. It shows the increased interest in this country by Australian and overseas explorers and that interest is being sustained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The high level of exploration together with new discoveries in recent years such as Wanea and Griffin on the North West Shelf has contributed to a greatly improved outlook for petroleum production over the next 10 years and consequently a higher level of self-sufficiency. Whereas earlier this year it was estimated that Australia would be only 50 per cent self-sufficient by the year 2000-that is at a 50 per cent probability level-it is now estimated, on the same basis, that Australia will be 67.5 per cent self-sufficient by the year 2000. I might also inform the House that the current adjusted rates for self-sufficiency are currently running at 81.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The improved scenario can be attributed to measures taken by this Government to encourage petroleum exploration and production including, as members of the House would be aware, the deregulation of the crude oil market, relaxation of foreign investment rules, improvements in the availability of geological and geophysical data and a comprehensive program for releasing offshore exploration areas. Further, the offshore strategy announced in June and the resource rental tax to which my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy earlier referred as initiatives taken in the last Budget are expected to result in con- tinued improvements. I think once again honourable members will be aware that they have been very warmly greeted by oil explorers in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude by making the point that the realisation that Australia is not unprospective but is under-explored will also of itself continue to ensure that we maintain high levels of oil exploration activity in this country, resulting ultimately in higher levels of production and self-sufficiency. When I previously raised the issue of the level of production and the levels of self-sufficiency under the previous Government, which was something of the order of only 65 per cent, that was greeted with mirth. If one knows the industry and has an opportunity of speaking to those who go out with a very high risk scenario to explore and produce in this country, almost all those people will concede that it is that range of policies brought about by this Government that is the single most important contributor to the important objectives of ensuring self-sufficiency in oil into the future for this country.</PARA>

Seeing as the honourable member for Mayo is a recent convert to the general agreement on tariffs and trade (GATT), he has probably read the report that GATT did on Australia. It was the first report on any country and it is a new practice which was initiated and encouraged by Australia and taken up by GATT. Indeed, my successor as Trade Minister, the now Attorney-General, offered that Australia should be one of the first countries reviewed by GATT in terms of our progress with trade liberalisation. What happened was that as a result of that independent review by GATT, it was able to conclude that Australia has one of the most impressive performances and pattern of trade liberalisation of almost any country. No-one will dispute the question of our progress in trying to free up this economy and make it more competitive so that our companies and industries can compete more effectively in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Is he aware of the decision by Bond University to close its graduate school of science and technology? Given his views on the importance of science and technology to this nation's future, can he explain to the house the implications of the decision?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the decision to close the Bond University School of Science and Technology. It is an unfortunate decision, but nevertheless it is one that has been made. It is unfortunate from the point of view of Australia's requirements. I have indicated in this House and in public forums on a number of occasions that I see science and technology providing the opportunity to address two of the most important challenges facing this economy. Firstly, through innovation becoming more competitive and therefore assisting the solution of our structural imbalance in the current account; and, secondly, its contribution to the sustainable development debate. That recognition, I concede, is also shared by the honourable member for Pearce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I point out that the simple fact is that we are experiencing shortages of graduates in some fields of science and engineering and that these shortages are expected to grow. Many leading industrial nations face a similar situation and will have to look elsewhere, including here, of course, for their supply of talented and skilled people. But this Government is addressing that issue. It is, of necessity, a long term problem; it cannot be fixed overnight. The number of higher education science students has increased over the past decade. This Government has made more positions available in key areas of science and engineering. The Government is also developing, through the Prime Minister's Science Council, a strategy for science and mathematics education in schools.</PARA>
<PARA> A key component of our science and technology strategy is to raise public awareness of the relevance of science and technology and thereby open up the opportunities for more rewarding career path oriented occupations. However, it does seem that young Australians are still not yet convinced of the variety of jobs that are open to them as graduates in science and technology or of the challenge, satisfaction and rewards that these jobs can offer, not just in research but also in applying the results of research to strengthen our industrial base and to resolve our environmental problems.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Bond University claims, it is true that our universities have had trouble in filling science places, but Bond University is a private institution. It has made a commercial decision about the viability of the school. It is a decision that I regret and, I believe, that is a loss to the nation. But it is a decision that ultimately the university has had to make and it is not one over which we have had any control or, indeed, any discussion. For the advocates of market forces on the other side, I point out that this highlights the shortcomings of market forces in meeting our needs and the challenges facing this nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Corio and I would both know, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate both put in bids for their budgets to the Minister for Finance and both have separate budgets. I understand that at the end of the last financial year the Senate did decide to purchase for each and every senator a fax machine. To purchase a fax machine for members of the House of Representatives who do not have them-and I think there would be about 96 if one takes away Ministers, officeholders, the Whips and some shadow Ministers-would cost about a quarter of a million dollars.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I do not intend to spend a quarter of a million dollars on providing honourable members with fax machines. I have asked the Serjeant-at-Arms to look at strategically placing some fax machines in other parts of the House of Representatives wing if it is too far for members to walk to their Whips' offices. It would probably be better for honourable members if they walked to their Whips' offices, where there are already fax machines, rather than have the Department go to the expense of placing one in each room at the cost of about a quarter of a million dollars.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in answer to the question about the leave loading, made two completely inaccurate accusations about my attitude on this matter. The first of those was that the proposition I put last Sunday was totally predicated on the assumption that all sacrifice in the community had to come from the work force. That is demonstrably untrue because I made it clear in the context of that proposition, and everything I have said about it since, that I was not seeking the unilateral withdrawal of the holiday leave loading. I recognise that it had to be treated on an enterprise by enterprise, case by case basis, and it was manifestly unreal to say that it should be unilaterally withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Although surveys show that Australian executives are poorly paid by international standards, surveys also show that executive salary increases have outstripped wage increases in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>The very point the Prime Minister made in his answer which he sought to argue, I refuse to accept. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The disparity in rates of increase is an obvious and understandable grievance among wage earners and other income earners who have suffered income losses from some companies' recent poor profit performances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to announce today a series of decisions affecting telecommunications and aviation, decisions which will help turn these industries into world class performers. These decisions are yet another instalment of the Government's drive for micro-economic reform, a process that is creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the world's best. These decisions are also just one part-albeit a critical part-of this Government's agenda of reform. They fit closely with the progress made at the Special Premiers Conference on improving the efficiency of the processes of government throughout Australia, such as in the important area of rail freight. They fit closely too with our real and steady progress in making our waterfront more efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of this activity has one central goal-a vital goal for every Australian: to equip our economy to deliver to its citizens the quality of life to which they justifiably aspire. For too long Australia was content to live with inefficiencies and low productivity in too many of our domestic industries. It is this Government's task vigorously and rapidly to sweep away those old arrangements and reshape our economy as a genuinely modern and competitive one. That is the simple and unarguable logic that has driven this Government's commitment to, and achievements in, micro-economic reform. The sometimes arcane jargon of the micro-economic reform debate must not be allowed to obscure the urgency and importance of that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, this is not the first time this Government has been able to report to Parliament on micro-economic reform-and it will most certainly not be the last. However, the decisions I will detail today represent perhaps our most significant achievement to date in this field. We have in the seven months since the election identified the issues in telecommunications and domestic aviation reform, consulted widely with those most directly affected by the changes and formulated imaginative and bold policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention in passing that we also managed to fit into this tight timeframe an historic special national conference of the Australian Labor Party which altered our Party's platform to accommodate these changes. By any standard the speed of the Government's action in this area and our persistence in pursuing change is proof of our commitment to reform of telecommunications and domestic aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, these reforms are marked by one special characteristic: they are real world solutions to real world problems. In this respect they are the antithesis of the half-baked ideas floated almost daily by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his front bench colleagues. Our reforms can be implemented and they will be implemented. It is my important duty today to outline these reforms to the House in the context of a broader progress report on the micro-economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> For most Australian households, the telephone provides an essential lifeline to society; it is perhaps the most important instrument of modern life. For Australian business it is literally an indispensable tool. It is no surprise that providing telephones and related equipment to Australians is a multi-billion dollar industry; in fact, it is one of our largest industries, providing 143,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecommunications pose a number of unique challenges. The pace of technological change regularly sees the major advances of a few years earlier superseded by new discoveries. This can easily render regulatory structures out of date; it can also mean new export markets and employment opportunities can swiftly emerge for an efficient industry equipped to take them up. </PARA>
<PARA> So for Australia we need to improve the efficiency with which we deliver telecommunications services within our country. It is equally clear that we must ready ourselves to take advantage of new export and job opportunities that will be created around the world, particularly with rapidly rising living standards in the Asia Pacific region. The nations of the Asia Pacific region have half the world's population but only 17 per cent of its 500 million telephones. Meeting the region's demand for new telecommunications services, servicing these vast new markets, poses an enormous opportunity for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is entirely right that this industry should be-as it has been-the subject of intense scrutiny and decisive action by this Government. Indeed we are taking one of Australia's biggest industries and reshaping it into a new, vastly more dynamic structure. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1987 and 1988, amid claims that sound familiar today about threats to Telecom Australia jobs, we initiated a series of reforms allowing competition in the provision of customer equipment and value-added services, and we established three far-reaching reviews which have resulted in today's major reforms. These reforms may be divided into four parts:</PARA>
<PARA> - establishing a new competitor;</PARA>
<PARA> - developing new services;</PARA>
<PARA> - strengthening the regulator;</PARA>
<PARA> - and ensuring a strong, publicly owned telecommunications company. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these elements contributes to the same outcome: benefits for Australia that are potentially limitless. We will see massive new private investment in the Australian economy; an expansion-not a contraction-of total jobs; a fall in STD prices on major trunk routes by as much as 40 per cent; and the creation of substantial and enduring export opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> The underlying conviction of these reforms is that introducing a new competitor into Australia will stimulate Telecom into lifting its performance for the customer-whether that customer is business or an ordinary household. But to ensure early benefits are obtained, it will be important to manage the first phase of competition carefully. In this first period, with only one competitor to Telecom, Austel and the Trade Practices Commission will be able to ensure Telecom is not able unduly to exploit its entrenched position of great strength. If this duopoly is to serve its purpose and if the possibility of collusion is to be avoided, it must have a finite term. We have decided that after 30 June 1997 the duopoly will terminate, paving the way for there to be no limit on network competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Aussat Pty Ltd will form the base for the new competitor and it will have unrestricted rights to provide all telecommunications services. Legislation to this effect will be introduced into Parliament this evening. Aussat will be sold and the new competitor will be up and running before the end of 1991. The sale will be carried out by a task force responsible to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), based in his Department, and reporting both to him and to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). All restrictions preventing Aussat from providing the full range of services will be removed by the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's representatives on the Aussat Board have been directed to resign forthwith and the Government will purchase Telecom's shareholding at its commercial value as at 24 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The new carrier will interconnect to the existing network at a price that will allow Telecom-OTC to recover the additional costs it incurs in providing facilities and services to the new carrier, and to underpin community service obligations. Regulatory safeguards will be put in place to ensure effective competition:</PARA>
<PARA> - We will require Telecom and OTC-separately, and after their merger into a new entity-to provide interconnection on an equal access basis to the second carrier for both domestic and international services;</PARA>
<PARA> - We will subject Telecom-OTC to separate price caps for local, trunk, and international services;</PARA>
<PARA> - We will ensure that Telecom carries and completes calls without diminution of quality on behalf of the second carrier, and provides it with all ancillary and supplementary services, such as billing, operator and directory services, and full access to information about customers and traffic flows;</PARA>
<PARA> - and we will insist on transparency in the financial transactions of both the new OTC-Telecom entity and the new carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> Our intention is to see new services develop both during the period of duopoly on the basic network and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of the duopoly, up to 1997, a broad range of competitors to Telecom and the new entrant will be encouraged in markets other than the basic network. First, we will licence a third mobile phone operator. The area of mobile telephony is booming; further technological and service improvements can be expected. It is, effectively, an alternative to local exchanges and, while expensive at present, it may, with further technological change, be the way of the future in telecommunications. Additional mobile licences may be made available in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, and in support of the decision on mobile telephones, the Government has adopted the Austel report on cordless telephone services, allowing unrestricted competition in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, we will remove all restrictions on resale, including on domestic and international telecommunications capacity. There will be no diminution of the rights of existing operators in this area. Furthermore, Austel will review the terms of resale, including the extent to which resellers can establish their own switching equipment. These changes will provide a major boost to value added service operators, their business clientele and to research and development efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, as the first phone monopoly held by Telecom ends on 30 June 1991, the Department of Transport and Communications, in conjunction with Austel, will bring forward a Cabinet memorandum on the appropriate network termination point for both licensed carriers prior to any new carrier arrangements coming into place. Telecom will, in any event, continue to offer a first telephone. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the regulator in conjunction with the Trade Practices Commission in promoting early and effective competition will be pivotal. In order to strengthen Austel for this role, the Government has decided that Austel's decisions on issues under its control will be absolute and final. Austel will be given the power and the resources to: arbitrate on all interconnection charges between the two network carriers; control numbering; manage Australia's input to international standards; prevent the misuse of market power; and report annually to the Government on safeguards and their effectiveness, and, importantly, on customer satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel will also have a role in ensuring that Australian industry benefits from these changes without compromising the overall objective of improved services for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout our deliberations we have been determined to maintain a strong public sector presence in Australian telecommunications, particularly because of its important role in discharging community service obligations. We will not place in the hands of future Treasurers or Ministers for Finance the responsibility for delivering services in areas where competition does not eventuate, nor do we expect that a new philanthropic owner for Telecom could be found who would provide them. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not attempt to deceive the people of Australia into believing that such an option is practical. We will ensure that the community's expectations are met; that prices fall in real terms across a range of services; that untimed calls continue to be offered to households; and that rural and remote services do not vanish. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom operates, for principally domestic purposes, a well-balanced telecommunications network, but it does not have a major export focus. In part, this is due to an artificial barrier between Telecom and OTC. This barrier will be removed by my Government, and a new corporate focus provided by merging the organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> That focus will have three basic purposes: first, under the challenge posed by a new, privately owned and fully resourced competitor, to pass on to customers in the form of lower prices and better service, the huge productivity gains that are inherent in this industry's technological explosion; second, to provide the basic opportunity for the new entrant to compete, encouraged both by the decisions of a newly strengthened Austel and the incentive created by the terms of the merger process itself; and third, to market its combined strengths overseas aggressively and to pursue with much greater vigour than previously its undoubted abilities in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> A fee will be paid to the Government as a result of the merger of Telecom-OTC. The level of that fee will be set by the Government in consultation with the new entity. It will also pay a fee for its mobile phone licence. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure that interconnect and equal access arrangements between the carriers are not unnecessarily delayed, Austel will have to certify that these are in place in all capital cities and will soon be available in provincial cities before the merger is finalised. Until that time OTC and Telecom will operate independently but with the benefit of an interim group board to oversee their collective operations in the transition to competition.</PARA>
<PARA>Aviation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This month marks the beginning of deregulation, with the abolition of the two airlines agreement. By terminating this infamous relic of coalition inertia, we have opened the door to dramatic growth in this vital sector of modern transport. The latter-day converts to micro-reform who sit opposite displayed their true colours when they were in government with their consistent failure over decades to remove this agreement. They were responsible for slowly strangling domestic aviation and pushing high costs onto the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of our decision to terminate the agreement, we see new services, lower prices, a new airline-hard evidence of the value of the decision to Australian consumers. In order to strengthen the hand of current and future entrants into domestic aviation, and in order to provide an appropriate environment for the sale of Australian Airlines and part of Qantas Airways Ltd, the Government has decided to lift the foreign investment limits relating to investment in Australian domestic airlines by foreign airlines servicing Australia from 15 per cent to 25 per cent for an individual holding, and to 40 per cent in aggregate; and maintain a stable policy environment for aviation for the remainder of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This decision to put further major policy change in this area on hold is sensible. It would be madness to introduce a major change such as deregulation and not give it a chance to work. It would similarly be stupid to attempt to sell the airlines while shifting the goal posts for potential purchasers. Our decision preserves future policy options. </PARA>
<PARA> The foreign investment changes offer clear opportunities for the New Zealand carrier to enter the Australian market. In addition, we have opened up the freight route across the Tasman and are now nominating two additional carriers to serve that market. In the light of these decisions, we will also discuss with New Zealand the question of closer aviation relations in the context of next month's review of the closer economic relations arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and 49 per cent of Qantas will strengthen them and enable them to provide much improved services to Australians and Australian businesses. They will be recapitalised. They are likely to form strategic partnerships. In all, they will be more competitive, and this nation will be better off as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of both airlines will be handled by the Minister for Finance in close consultation with the Minister for Transport and Communications. The Government will take its own decisions on the issues related to sale, but it recognises that the airline boards have a right to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA> Special arrangements will apply to the part sale of Qantas. In order to accord with our bilateral air service agreement, the foreign investment limit in Qantas will be set at the generally accepted international benchmark of 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, although Qantas will remain as our single designated international passenger carrier for the foreseeable future, the Government recognises that-with the success of our reforms of international charter programs for air freight-there is a potential role for a second designated freight carrier. A process is currently under way to assess expressions of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, Qantas and our tourism industry will continue to benefit from our intention to continue to sign new bilateral air service agreements and to welcome charter programs. There are gains still to be made, both from traditional markets and from a more intense focus on regional opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>Land Transport</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not a well recognised fact that of all the areas of micro-economic reform, land transport offers the greatest potential gains. The Industry Commission has estimated these to be worth over $4 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA> At the recent Special Premiers Conference, the Premiers, Chief Ministers, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I cut through the remaining disagreements to set in place fundamental reforms in both road and rail operations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I made clear earlier this year in calling the Special Premiers Conference, our rail systems in this country cannot operate efficiently with their present structure. Interstate freight alone loses $300 million a year, excluding efficiency losses from traffic now on the roads which might more appropriately be handled by rail. </PARA>
<PARA> Our commitment to improving competitiveness required us to redress these imbalances through seeking State agreement to form a National Rail Freight Corporation. This will involve new investment, new industrial relations standards and new rail management. A heads of agreement has been signed by the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, committing all governments to work towards a start-up date of July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Premiers Conference, the hard bargaining on asset values, equity considerations, reform of labour practices and other issues will commence. The Commonwealth's role is clear. We are prepared to contribute significantly to the success of the venture. We expect the States and the unions to do so as well, including particularly in respect of manning levels and work practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Rail Freight Corporation will not justify the effort necessary from unions and governments if the heaviest road transport vehicles do not themselves bear a proper share of the costs of using roads. Current efforts by some States to recover costs through registration fees have been frustrated because transport operators have simply been able to register their vehicles interstate. But the damage to the nation's roads continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth, States and Territories have agreed to the following objectives:</PARA>
<PARA> - first, introduction of nationally uniform technical and operating regulations and driver licensing arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> - second, the progressive introduction of nationally consistent road user charges having regard to principles established by the Inter-State Commission, with a view ultimately to achieving full recovery of the cost of road use; and</PARA>
<PARA> - third, clearer definition of responsibilities between different levels of government for funding and managing elements of the road system, aimed at eliminating duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to take a continuing interest in the implementation of these changes and I expect that the Premiers will do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> We all recognise that the road transport industry is vital to our future. It is the very lifeblood of many of our industries. As we introduce the changes I have detailed today, we will keep the industry informed and respect its views. In turn, we expect that the industry will acknowledge the commonsense underlying these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>The Waterfront</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> More has been said about the waterfront than perhaps any other industry issue in this country. This Government has not, however, joined the queue of people who complain but do not act. </PARA>
<PARA> The waterfront reform plan which we adopted last year has already yielded significant results:</PARA>
<PARA> - new stevedoring arrangements for bulk grain ships, reducing manning levels by 70 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA> - retirement of 280 gangway watchmen;</PARA>
<PARA> - recruitment and training of 200 new waterside workers;</PARA>
<PARA> - development of an interim award agreement to facilitate award restructuring and the negotiation of enterprise agreements; and</PARA>
<PARA> - most importantly, enterprise agreements currently being concluded at two of the largest terminal operations in Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> These agreements are expected to be forwarded shortly to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority for its independent assessment. National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, the company negotiating these agreements, has publicly stated that it expects productivity gains of up to 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing process of waterfront reform also includes involvement by the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority to enhance the competitive environment on the waterfront and ensure that users receive the benefits of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in the efficiency of the Australian shipping fleet continue to be made under our shipping reform strategy. To date, in excess of 350 seafarers have accepted voluntary early retirement packages. At the end of June 1990, the average crew size for the Australian fleet was 25 compared with 33 six years ago. By June 1992 it is expected that the average crew will be 21. All this continues to be achieved with no industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset of my comments today I described this statement as a progress report. I emphasise the word `progress'; Australia is now making progress, achieving fundamental and lasting reform, in industries that for decades had seen no progress, no reform. </PARA>
<PARA> So I repeat my challenge to members of the Opposition. Let them point to any period of Australian history that has seen faster or more profound micro-economic reform. That challenge, which I have issued before, remains unanswered because, of course, as I have said in the past, there is no earlier period that comes within a bull's roar of the progress that we have made and are continuing to make. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House and this nation that, for 31 of the 34 years before we came to office, Australia was ruled by the dead hand of conservative inertia in which notions of reform to achieve productivity and efficiency were totally alien. That legacy of neglect and of abrogated leadership is a heavy burden still borne by the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by discussing the method of progress: its pace and process. The House should note that the progress we have made has been with little industrial disputation and with the emphasis on patient negotiation with all the parties involved. The Government has not failed to be firm where firmness is needed, but we have refused to indulge in the confrontationist tactics that are so often urged on us. That is why it has been swift reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this, some professional commentators outside this House, and most of the amateur ones opposite, often call for a faster pace of reform. The secret of faster reform, we are told, lies in the amount of hair on the chest of Government: solutions should be imposed unilaterally by Government and let the devil take the hindmost. One can tell these commentators are not living in the real world by the way they float new proposals. When they are presented with irrefutable evidence of Government progress in micro-economic reform, their sole response is to play catch-up, `Oh, we would do that-and more', as if the mere wish could be the father to the deed. </PARA>
<PARA> Very fortunately for the nation, those in this House who indulge in these stupidities do so from the safe impotence of Opposition. It is fortunate, because their whole approach is a recipe for disaster. Lacking any sort of detailed strategy of how they would actually achieve reform, they are forced to peddle the pleasant deception that easy reform and painless change can be won through confrontation. Of course, real progress is not made by bringing the nation to a standstill in some pointless industrial confrontation; real progress can be made only by harnessing businesses, trade unions, and governments in a cooperative pursuit of their common interests. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no easy reforms or painless changes to be made. Reforming entrenched community attitudes and institutions is hard work-but it is hard work this Government is determined to undertake and to bring to an effective conclusion. That way there will be many more progress reports from this Government describing our continued, effective and rapid progress in micro-economic reform, creating an increasingly efficient, productive and competitive nation. I table on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) a supporting document relating to the matters I have raised today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I welcome the opportunity provided by this House to respond to the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on what he has described as a parliamentary statement on micro-economic reform. He has correctly chosen the term `micro-economic reform' because, when we look at the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, for example, at the definition of the word `micro', we see:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>extremely small, minute in scope or capability. </PARA>
<PARA>That would be a fair summary of what has been brought down today as essentially a re-release of a number of partial decisions taken on earlier occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a couple of years ago-I think in June 1989-our Treasurer (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA>I guarantee you that if you walk into any pet shop in Australia the resident galah will be talking about micro-economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The galahs all over the country might be squawking about micro-economic policy, but the Government on the other side of this House has very little idea what is meant by what is a very important part of the necessary policy adjustments to turn this country around. Indeed, I think it is fair comment to simply say this Government has come very late to the process of micro-economic reform. It is this Government's failure to address micro reform which has condemned Australia to slow growth in our productive potential and has left us particularly vulnerable to overseas economic developments. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no better source for some of those remarks than the Industry Commission's annual report which was released today, and I quote just one paragraph, although there are dozens that relate to the necessity to accelerate the pace of change:</PARA>
<PARA>To reduce our vulnerability we need to take urgent and sustained action to raise our productivity performance. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is damned out of the mouth of its own Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In simple terms the supply side of our economy has been unable to keep pace with the demand side. We have been effectively in a productivity slump in this country over the lifetime of the Hawke-Keating Government. Indeed, the latest national accounts show gross domestic product (GDP) per hour in the June quarter was equal to the average for 1984-85. In short, therefore, all the increase in national production since 1984-85 has come from increasing the number of hours worked, not by any improvement in productivity. As a nation, therefore, we have only been able to increase our production by working more hours. There has been no increase in labour productivity over the life of the Hawke-Keating Government, and that in itself stands as a very effective measure of the failure of that Government to introduce any significant micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> This abysmal performance, combined with the Government's inability to reduce public spending or to produce internationally competitive wage outcomes-and the Prime Minister obviously has no idea what that means in light of his answer in the Parliament today-has forced this Government to rely excessively on monetary policy and high interest rates to slow the economy. This is a point now conceded by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) in his statement to the Press Club yesterday, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>It is because our domestic supply response has been incapable of producing this result that we have had to slow the growth of imports by slowing the entire economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Monetary policy has been a very blunt instrument and it has hit very unevenly at our society. It has cut particularly hard into the wealth creating sectors of our economy and into families and small business people and farmers who are struggling to make ends meet or buy their home or build their business. </PARA>
<PARA> The result is twofold: large sections of our farming and business communities have been irreparably damaged, as the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) has conceded. We are now seeing record bankruptcies, corporate failures and liquidations. More are to come as we hear the anecdotal evidence, and these of course are yet to hit and are yet to be fully reflected in the unemployment numbers. Even on today's numbers, we have seen the third consecutive month in which there has been a fall in employment. We have seen the unemployment rate now rise in the fourth month of this financial year to 7.6 per cent-already above the Budget time forecast for June of next year of 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The second consequence relating to this excessive reliance on high interest rates has been that business investment, which is vitally needed to turn this economy around-and the Treasurer on many occasions has conceded this-has collapsed. Indeed, in the year to June there has been a 13 per cent fall in investment as a consequence of the Government's high interest rate policies. I notice in Access Economics' recent report it is estimated the capital stock will grow by only 2 per cent per annum in the years 1991 and 1992, which will be the lowest increases in our capital stock on record. So much for the Treasurer's investment boom. The damage has been done. We will have to commence rebuilding our industry from a very low base. To be clear, we should understand the magnitude of the task that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I have no better authority on the magnitude of the task than the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Yesterday at the National Press Club he said:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to stabilise the current account at that level of import growth, exports would need to grow annually between 4.2 to 8.3 per cent or between $2.7 and $5.3 billion per year. In other words unless exports increase every year by at least $3 billion we will be faced by rising debt and/or higher levels of unemployment. That means--</PARA>
<PARA>he has a particularly pertinent way of describing the contents of the magnitude of that task--</PARA>
<PARA>at a minimum, the equivalent of three new North West Shelf projects every year.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very honest and fair assessment of the magnitude of the task. We need to shift something like 3 3/4 per cent of our domestic production activity into exports and we need to do that over the next five years just to stabilise our debt to GDP ratio-not to stop it going up, just to stabilise it. The tragedy is that there has not been a five-year period in the whole postwar period where we have gone anywhere near achieving that order of magnitude in terms of the shift. </PARA>
<PARA> In very difficult economic circumstances where industry and average Australians have been looking for a broad, integrated reform agenda from this Government, where they have been looking for leadership from this Government, they certainly have not had it. The Government has instead responded as it has today-very cynically overstating and exaggerating the magnitude of minuscule changes in relation to infrastructure in this country and continuing to focus its attention and rely exclusively on high interest rates. We are locked into high real interest rates. We will stay locked into them until this Government does the job it needs to do as described by its own Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response has always been to fail to deliver micro-economic reform and therefore to raise interest rates to increasingly high levels in each round of the boom-bust cycle. In the most recent boom it raised them to unprecedented levels and it has kept them there for an unprecedented length of time. Perhaps the best barometer we have of the magnitude of the Government's failure in relation to micro-economic reform is the extent to which it has put up interest rates and kept them at those unprecedented levels. That is the best barometer of the extent to which they have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to my original remarks about the appropriateness of the word `micro'. I can assure members of the House that nothing will improve. Improvement in the current account under the Government will come only as it drives this economy into recession; as it forces a collapse in investment, the thing we most need to turn around this country; as it continues to concentrate adjustments on the private sector, annihilating large parts of the private sector, rather than achieving adjustments across the board. The result will be that if activity picks up again the balance of payments problem will just come back in spades. There will be no net improvement in our economic circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government really cannot act. The main problems of our infrastructure-and there are many-can be summarised under a number of heads. First, we have the problem, the concentration, if you like, of public rather than private ownership, especially in relation to publicly owned and managed monopolies. Secondly, we have extensive barriers to entry and excessive regulation which together, particularly with the first problem, tend to significantly restrict competition in many of our infrastructure industries. That in turn breeds inefficient work and management practices, featherbedded jobs and the monument to inefficiency that this Government has built up over the last seven years. It will not be able to deal with any of those problems because when we analyse each of those sectors and the magnitude of the adjustment that needs to be made in each of them we see that it will not be able to act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not be able to act because of some philosophical hang-up about public ownership being in some sense preferable to private sector ownership or because of its ties to the union movement, the fact that it is dominated and controlled by people like Bill Kelty and other leaders of the Australian Council of Trade Unions or particular unions in some of those infrastructure industries that carry unusual weight with this Government. It will not be able to act because it is hogtied by other deals it has done with various special interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much the politics of privilege that this Government has embarked on. It looks after its mates. It is not interested in genuine reform. It has no capacity to deliver genuine reform and it is certainly not governing in the best interests of the people of Australia, because what the people of Australia want are quite simple things. They want cheaper telephone calls, lower air fares, lower freight charges, lower waterfront charges, an opportunity to work harder and to keep more after tax than they are allowed under the present system. They want a chance to own some of our public sector enterprises. To a large extent they want to be given the opportunity to be mini-capitalists. They want a chance to be proud of our country and its economic performance and its international standing. They do not want to have to be what they are today, which is embarrassed at having to explain the failings of our Government, the inefficiencies of our industries and the lost opportunities that we have seen under the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government governs for a privileged few, a few special interests, a few mates, and today's statement on micro policy proves this perhaps better than anything else the Prime Minister has said in recent days. It provides overwhelming evidence of how this Government governs in the best interests of a few people and not in the best interests of the people of Australia. So I urge my colleagues, when they read this speech in more detail, to ask themselves a few key questions which is the only way they can realistically assess this Government's approach to micro-economic reform. They should ask themselves, for example, what is the deal that is being done here, what is being dressed up, how is the deal being dressed up, how is it being hidden, who stands to benefit from some of these decisions. Let us isolate the special interests. Who is being bought off? What is the price being paid? What is the cost to the average Australian?</PARA>
<PARA> After those introductory remarks, I want to pick a few key elements of today's speech and comment on them in some detail. Let me begin with the area of so-called telecommunications reform. Let us not kid ourselves. The Government's so-called reforms of telecommunications go nowhere near constituting effective competition. It bandies the word around, but there will not be effective competition under the decisions that were reannounced today. Effective competition in telecommunications requires that any competitor can operate a telecommunications service and that any competitor can have access to Telecom Australia's network at what are described as fair and reasonable prices. The Government's changes clearly do not allow full and open competition. Rather, they are focused on a particular very limited form of competition, a duopoly, which is, indeed, probably hardly any improvement on the present system, particularly when we consider the way the Government is building monstercom and burying the only efficient telecommunications company in the public sector in Australia, OTC Ltd, in Telecom as part of the construction of monstercom. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover the Government's refusal to put Telecom into private ownership reflects its fear of taking on the power brokers in the telecommunications union. It was asserted during the telecommunications debate, for example, that there were something like 30,000 excess jobs in Telecom alone, out of nearly 90,000: that is roughly one in three or one in four in terms of broad orders of magnitude. So it is not hard to see why the Government has torn itself apart on the telecommunications issue, given the significance of the power and influence of that particular union to its organisational structure. The cosy lifestyles of many of its privileged constituency were clearly at stake when they tore themselves apart for the best part of five or six months. Put simply, the Government's failure to inject full and open competition in telecommunications means that the rest of Australia suffers at the expense of those featherbedded jobs in telecommunications. If I could borrow a term from Winston Churchill, it could be a case that never was so much owed by so few to so many. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's monopoly power over the first phone, of course, was ensured by the Telecommunications Act 1975. Telecom is one of the largest employers in Australia and in comparison with similar carriers overseas, Telecom is grossly inefficient. The House does not need me to stand here and quote statistics. Honourable members can ask any average Australian who has had anything to do with Telecom in recent days about the costs and unreliability of the services that it provides. </PARA>
<PARA> Inefficiencies in Telecom principally stem from overmanning and the inappropriate work conditions which have bred inefficient management practices within that organisation. Evidence suggests, for example, that Telecom's costs are significantly higher and its productivity performance is significantly poorer than that of its Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development counterparts. For example, in Australia's telecommunications network there are 88 main lines per employee compared with 202 in the United States, 162 in France and 133 in Canada. In a recent report, Professor Ergas, an experienced and unquestioned expert in relation to the telecommunications industry in Australia, came to this extraordinary conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA>STD prices are in effect so high that they may exceed stand alone costs, ie at 1987 Telecom charges. It could have been profitable for an independent provider of STD service to entirely bypass the Telecom network even to the extent of replicating local distribution cable merely to carry STD calls. It stands as a monument to inefficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that Professor Ergas has estimated that effective competition in Australia's telecommunications could reduce prices by about 15 per cent on average across the board. That is 15 per cent on average across the board to all Telecom users. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the particular proposals that are detailed in today's statement, we see the concept of a duopoly developed. There is to be one competitor introduced into the industry to compete with monstercom and that competitor is to be based on Aussat. Anybody who knows anything about Aussat has a pretty clear idea that Aussat is at least about $400m to $500m in the hole already before we start. So one's chance to get in there and be a competitor against Telecom and OTC-against monstercom-requires one to pick up the dead of Aussat and to somehow make some sort of contribution to the Government. We have been ridiculed for saying that that will not produce effective competition. But if one thinks about that one realises that any new competitor, who is required to pick up Aussat and to contribute to the Government's coffers, is already starting a long way behind in terms of effective telecommunications competition. Then we realise, as is said in this document today, that this new carrier:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will interconnect to the existing network at a price that will allow Telecom-OTC to recover the additional costs it incurs in providing facilities and services to the new carrier and to underpin community service obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>So Telecom-OTC will do all it can to meet all its community service obligations and then it will determine the price at which the new competitor can gain access to the system. What a joke! One has to pay twice up-front and then operate with at least one hand tied behind one's back in order to try to be an effective competitor. The concept of effective competition in telecommunications as advocated in this document is just total nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I point to the fact that the Government has now put a time limit on the length of the duopoly. That time limit is to run out on 30 June 1997. The Government mocked my colleague, the shadow Minister for Communications, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), when he suggested that if it were going down the inappropriate route of a duopoly it should put a time limit on it. The Government ridiculed him. It is good to see is that it has now, at least to that minuscule extent, picked up a very sensible and responsible proposal that has come from our side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we welcome the fact that the Government has decided to grant additional mobile licences. That is a good decision and that too was a decision advocated by my colleague, the shadow Minister for Communications, a well known and quite famous Australian QC and an outstanding contributor to this Parliament. The Government picked up yet a second proposal from my colleague. Indeed, it looks like it may go down the path of having even more competition in relation to mobile telephones, which I think will be a very important development-one also advocated by my colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Government picked up my colleague's proposal in relation to the resale of access to the excess capacity of the Telecom network. I am very pleased to see that decision too. So there are three decisions: the end of the duopoly; the sale of additional mobile telephone licences; and the resale of excess capacity, all ideas advocated by my colleague and all the subject of mocking in this Parliament by the Minister, the Prime Minister and a whole host of others. It is good to see that at least the Government has gone in the right direction and picked up those proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make to those three honourable members on the Government benches who have bothered to come in and listen to this speech is that those three decisions run entirely counter to the decision that was taken at the recent Australian Labor Party special conference. There will be some interesting blood-letting going on on the other side of this House when those opposite recognise the significance of the shift in policy that has been achieved since they thought they had determined that policy at the special conference just a couple of months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, in relation to telecommunications I would like to focus briefly on the role that the Government foreshadows for Austel. I find on page 5 of this document the very interesting statement:</PARA>
<PARA>In order to strengthen Austel for this role-</PARA>
<PARA> that is, the special regulatory role; the Government believes in competition through regulation, by the way, which is a novel concept-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has decided that Austel's decisions on issues under its control will be absolute and final. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not pretend to be a lawyer, but I would not surprised if that were unconstitutional. It is absolutely ridiculous to suggest that a body like Austel could be elevated above or put beyond the law in terms of the conduct of telecommunications policy. I guess that the Government will be having another look at that in the course of the next few days. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, in relation to telecommunications, I was fascinated by the Government's justification for the continued public sector ownership. It wants to maintain, as I have said, public sector ownership of monstercom-that is, Telecom plus OTC. The justification it gives is to keep the community service obligations in the public sector. If one thinks about that, one realises that that is hardly a reason for maintaining public sector ownership. It is a classic confirmation of the worst features of the processes of Telecom at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we know Telecom's record in relation to the size of its community service obligations. It has used them for years to rationalise its inefficiency and to divert attention from its inefficiency. Interestingly, under the scrutiny of recent days, Telecom has changed or varied its estimate of the size of those community service obligations. It used to run on the line that they cost about $1 billion to provide. Next it was $800m and then it was $600m. Then the truth came out because the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimated that they are worth, at most, $240m. The proposal of my colleague the shadow Minister for Communications is that those community service obligations can be readily put on the budget. He has no better authority for that view than the Minister himself who, in this House, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do give the Opposition credit for one thing. There is only one way to meet community service obligations and that is to put them on the budget. There is no other way of doing it and at least the Opposition has had the honesty to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA>At least the Minister has had the honesty to acknowledge that. No more should there be an argument to justify public sector ownership of Telecom and OTC monstercom on the basis of the treatment of community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, in relation to telecommunications, there is to be a fee. That is a novel approach by this Government because most of what it does is driven by getting money for nothing. It will be a fee for the merger of OTC and Telecom. As is usual, no details are provided of the magnitude of that fee or how it will be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, and I think quite subtly, it has been admitted that the Minister has had a win. He has had a major win in that the sale of Aussat will be supervised, monitored, coordinated and so on by a special task force set up in the Department of Transport and Communications, and not in the Department of Finance where there is already a task force that is responsible for asset sales. The Minister for Transport and Communications has rolled the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and has successfully moved that control of the sale of Aussat into his own Department. It is a sad commentary, I believe, on what has been a grossly inefficient operation by the task force in the Department of Finance. We have no better example of that than the gas pipeline that is subject to some legislation that will be debated in the course of the next few days. Those would be my main comments on the proposals in relation to telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the proposal on the National Freight Corporation, we have broadly accepted that as a reasonable step forward. We think that it is a sensible move, although one cannot help but wonder what the real motive was there as well. Will it really result in an efficient rail freight system in Australia or has it got a bit more to do with the fact that Mrs Kirner needed to be bailed out in another way? Mrs Kirner has a bad problem in trying to inject some capital into the Victorian rail line. She wants to upgrade the Melbourne-Sydney link and a few other things. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been various reports on this recently, for example, in a magazine called Inside Canberra on 26 October. It identifies that Mrs Kirner had been looking for about $600m for improvements in the Melbourne-Sydney railway and a further $200 for redundancy proposals in relation to railway workers. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>This is part of the price Victoria wants to extract for its agreement to a National Rail Freight Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>While the principle and the direction seem OK, once we scratch the surface we will find the smelly deal. As I said at the start, it is always the way with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, let me look at the issue of aviation and some of the comments that have been made by the Prime Minister on so-called micro reform in relation to aviation. My colleague the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, is sitting directly behind me. He has many times complimented the Government on the decision to deregulate the airline industry and to privatise at least Australian Airlines Ltd. While the he has accepted some partial privatisation of Qantas Airways Ltd, he has expressed dissatisfaction at the fact that the Government did not go all the way. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, we would welcome a further decision to increase the maximum aggregate for foreign ownership in domestic airlines to 40 per cent and the increase in the limit from 15 per cent to 25 per cent for individual foreign shareholdings in Australian domestic airlines. Of course, this does beg the question: Why do we bother with the limits at all? In the telecommunications area, it begs the question: If we are going to get rid of a duopoly after seven years, why do we not get rid of it now and start with full competition? If one is going towards full competition, believes in full competition and wants effective foreign competitors as part of that competition, why do we have limits in those terms? If one is expecting a range of new airlines to open up-maybe one could end up with five or six, whatever number the Government has in mind-why would it not be possible for one of them to be a foreign owned competitor? Again, these half-hearted decisions are not made on the basis of any rational assessment of what is in the best interest of the people of Australia. Obviously, it is another smelly deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the decisions on aviation, while, of course, we do not question the decision to deregulate and some of the other things I have mentioned, we do question the magnitude of the benefits the Government is claiming. Indeed, we find it quite difficult to imagine that there are going to be significant benefits at all. What does it achieve if the airline industry is deregulated, but no runways are built for planes to land on, if no airports are built for planes to fly into or the terminal space that is essential to handle the load of passengers, freight and so on is not built? So the benefits are being exaggerated without the infrastructure being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very interesting today that that noted Labor party expert and ex-Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, has drawn attention to the monumental inefficiency that has emerged in the airline industry because of the Government's failure to build the third runway at Mascot, which he put on the agenda 17 or 18 years ago. We decided to build it in 1982, but the Australian Labor Party was still debating it on the basis of cheap politics associated with the area near to Mascot. We see planes queuing up for hours and being delayed on the tarmac and a tremendous loss of tourist income potential. Of course, we welcome the decisions on the aviation industry, but what a nonsense it is to suggest that they are going to be significant until we face up to the real issues- building a third runway, a second airport, terminal capacity and so on. That might actually force the Government to face in a more realistic way the issue of privatisation in relation to the airline industry, because I do not think that it is going to have the capital to do any of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to aviation, we are a bit fascinated by the 49 per cent limit that has been placed on the degree of privatisaton in Qantas. What is Qantas going to gain by selling 49 per cent of itself to the private sector? We have not really been told who in the private sector is going to get access. I would not be surprised if, in relation to Qantas, there were a few deals around for some union to get its superannuation fund into Qantas and increase its power base in Qantas. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), an ex-member of the Qantas board, is smiling because he has a very clear idea as to the magnitude of the problem that exists in Qantas. Selling 49 per cent leaves Qantas in the public sector. It leaves Qantas controlled by public sector management; it leaves Qantas subject to the limits of the Cabinet decision making process. And we all know how limited that has become these days. </PARA>
<PARA> The management of Qantas can look forward in a continued way to eight, nine or 10 ministerial directives a month to the board or management from the Government Minister telling it how it ought to run an airline. We can all sit back and watch the relative performance of Qantas internationally continue to be eroded. I was fascinated to see the comment by John Ward, the Chief Executive Officer of Qantas, who said, in relation to the proposal to sell 49 per cent of Qantas to the private sector, that from his point of view it was just going to be business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there are a few decisions in relation to what are called strategic partnerships. It is said that Australian Airlines and Qantas are likely to form a strategic partnership and that, in all, they will be more competitive and this nation will be better off as a result. The mind boggles at what the Government means by a strategic partnership in relation to Qantas and Australian Airlines, but, in my mind, the decision clearly begs the question of when Ansett is going to get its international carrier's licence. It certainly opens the door to the possibility. While I personally think that the whole airline industry probably ought to be opened up so that Ansett Airlines of Australia and everyone else can have international carrier licences, I would like to see what the Government actually has in mind in relation to the limit of 49 per cent and these strategic partnerships that it has buried in the back of its mind. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there was a decision announced on about page 8 of the Prime Minister's opening statement in relation to a designated freight carrier licence being given. Of course, no name was given on this particular occasion. But I wonder if the Government has anybody in mind for that second licence. Of course, nothing is done in the best interest of the people of Australia. But this time there is also one interesting thing about the aviation decisions. The Minister for Transport and Communications did not get his win. He is in charge of aviation, isn't he?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He made such a lasting impact that I had forgotten. He does not get control of the task force this time. The Government had to give the Treasurer and Minister for Finance something, having been so decisively rolled all the way through the decision making process, so it gave them control over the sale of 100 per cent of Australian Airlines and the 49 per cent of Qantas. Everything involved with the Government side of this House is a deal, and there is undoubtedly a deal there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The poor old Treasurer had advocated a much better telecommunications option than the other guys. At least he tried to keep OTC as the basis for the second competitor, a very sensible thing if one wants to settle for the second best option rather than the third best option. But he should have listened to us and gone for the best option of full-blooded competition in communications. </PARA>
<PARA> Next the Prime Minister made some statements about waterfront reform. This would stand as a monument to hyperbole if nothing else. His claims of progress in relation to waterfront reform are nothing short of a joke. They are gross exaggeration. The Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) was finalised in October last year. We all know about that. We keep reading about how successful it is. I say that tongue-in-cheek. Under that agreement, the Government committed $154m over three years on a dollar for dollar basis with employers towards the cost of redundancy payments, training and retraining. The Government was looking for a 30 per cent improvement in productivity as a result of that tremendous process over three years. Under WIRA by October this year, 500 departures from the industry were required to have been processed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague correctly asks the question. The problem is that so far not one redundancy under WIRA has been processed. The aim was 500 redundancies over 12 months, but there has been not one. Indeed, 213 additional employees have commenced business. What we do stands in very sharp contrast to what others are doing in the waterfront area. Even if we were to take it all at face value, we would still fall further behind in relation to the waterfront reform. For example, to April this year, against our projected productivity improvement over three years of 30 per cent, the United Kingdom has achieved a productivity improvement of 65 per cent with a package that has cost $70,000 on average per worker to make them redundant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In New Zealand last year there was a productivity improvement of 100 per cent with a package that cost $24,000 on average per worker to make them redundant. In Australia, accepting WIRA on face value, the Government expects a 30 per cent productivity improvement over three years with a package of about an average of $100,000 per worker made redundant if, of course, it can get them to actually become redundant as a result of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government process of waterfront reform has already failed in the early stages of this brave new world that it has described. This is best illustrated by the fact that Australia's largest stevedore, Conaust Pty Ltd, has withdrawn from the negotiations on enterprise agreements on the grounds that it is wasting its time until the Government and the unions are prepared to take-wait for it-the hard decisions that the Prime Minister stood here and boasted about all day. </PARA>
<PARA> Examples and anecdotes, of course, on the extent of inefficiencies on our waterfront are well known. I look, for example, at the Pappas-Carter report on Australian manufacturing, and I quote just one paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of reliability and efficiency our ports are far behind those in other countries like Singapore. Data show that containers were loaded on and off ships four or five times faster in Singapore than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that would be where there were no black bans, work stoppages, go slows, idle time and so on. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Stevedoring firms do not offer priority berths for shippers who arrive on a regular basis, as is the case in most major overseas ports. Lack of reliability causes queuing and intermittent congestion. It increases costs by delaying ships and it makes superior service to customers very difficult. Australia is holding back its existing industries because of its inefficient ports. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not have said it better, and the Prime Minister was bold enough to cite some specific examples of some of the improvements, and he picked bulk grain handling as one of the ones where there have been significant improvements. I am told by my colleague that there was a deal done on the Brisbane waterfront in relation to bulk grain handling: they wanted three waterside workers to push the button to start the process; it is entirely automated of course. But three of them were needed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course there were three of them. As the Minister for Science and Technology knows only too well, there has to be a first aid officer and because there were then four there would need to be a foreman. That is only reasonable, he would say. And then because there were five there would need to be a supervisor. So why not have six people sitting around on idle time operating a fully automated grain handling procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statements and claims on waterfront reform are a total joke. The waterfront is a classic example of the Government dressing up a scheme to make it look as though progress is under way when in fact the crucial impediment to Australia's exporting effort remains untouched. </PARA>
<PARA> In areas like coastal shipping the statement is almost silent. Looking at issues like Australia-New Zealand trans-Tasman shipping, it is particularly silent. We all know coastal shipping is very cost uncompetitive. That is why we consume on the east coast of Australia salt that we import from Mexico. It is a hell of a lot cheaper than bringing it around the coast from South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We all recognise that taking a container from Hobart to Melbourne costs more than it does to take the same container from Hobart to London. The Minister on the other side can stick his chest out and be very proud of that gross inefficiency that he undoubtedly had a substantial part in in recent days. In relation to the Australia-New Zealand review of trans- Tasman shipping it was reported that freight rate reductions of 20 per cent for non-bulk cargoes and 50 per cent for bulk cargoes were possible-that is 20 and 50 per cent reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> The main reason for the current inefficiency is trade union policy and practice which excludes all but the Australian and New Zealand carriers looking after their mates-featherbedded jobs, the same explanation. Without such bans, certain portions of the trans-Tasman task could be carried out by foreign vessels serving Europe and United States and Australasian routes that currently sail empty or partly laden across the Tasman. There is no legislative basis to the bans but there has been no overt government support for their removal. </PARA>
<PARA> The projected cost saving in Tasman freight rates from their removal has been accompanied by a 45 per cent reduction in Australia's exports of water transport services reflecting the loss of this trade to foreign carriers. It is no wonder that our policy is to inject foreign competition into coastal shipping to bring about a significant reduction in the costs of coastal shipping and in relation to the trans-Tasman route. The people of Australia are paying again through the nose for gross inefficiencies on the part of this Government. That about does it. I have been through the main features of this report that the Prime Minister brought down today, as I said, on the subject of micro-I emphasise micro-reform. The Prime Minister left out a lot of areas where he could not even make those sort of gratuitous comments in relation to the performance of the Government: Labour market reform, for example-probably the single most important thing this country needs in order to get itself out of the mire. It is not going to happen under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will talk about enterprise bargaining like it talks about competition in telecommunications and so on but it will never deliver genuine enterprise bargaining in terms of labour market reform. The Government does not believe in one union companies. The Government does not believe in employees and employers sitting down at the work place-the only reasonable place to settle wages and conditions-and negotiating on an equivalent legal basis. The Government does not believe in any of that, so the more the Government talks about enterprise bargaining the more one should look at the size of the tongue it has stuck in its cheek. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, on taxation the Government has not said anything about taxation, and taxation is one of the most major micro reforms. The Prime Minister has given up on taxation reform and he has given up on expenditure restraint, which is a pity because that is the only way one gets to reduce the overall tax burden in Australia-by cutting back government expenditure. In the past couple of days the Prime Minister has come into the Parliament and mocked me because I have dared to suggest that maybe at the Special Premiers Conference the Government should have looked at the issue of cutting back the size of the public sector and reducing public sector expenditure so that overall Australians could look forward to lower tax. </PARA>
<PARA> No, the Prime Minister is quite happy to give them more expenditure and more tax, I assume, by the arguments that he has put to us this week. We know the Prime Minister is not prepared to change the mix of taxation. The Treasurer comes in with his daily Dorothy Dix on the introduction of a goods and services tax; a rather novel proposal from the Treasurer who advocated it himself so toughly in 1985. And who was he rolled by? It was the Minister for Science and Technology sitting over there and a host of others in 1985. Again, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) stepped in and blocked effective reform-an opportunity to shift the mix of taxation, to take taxes off business inputs, to take taxes off exports, to significantly lower personal tax rates like other countries are doing. Again, a major opportunity has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has now got himself in a very desperate position in relation to a goods and services tax because last week when he was agreeing at the Special Premiers Conference to look at the possibility of handing back taxing powers to the States, he included as one of those possibilities the possibility of giving the States indirect taxing powers. So are we to believe that he is not prepared to embrace the concept of a goods and services tax at the Federal level-at the Commonwealth level-but he is quite happy to give goods and services taxing powers to each of the States?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer can come in here and answer his dorothy dixers, but he has a long way to go in terms of winning that debate. Of course he buckets us in his other daily Dorothy on capital gains tax. Why? Because he knows that was a very good decision. He knows that this country is grinding to a halt because people have no incentive to put their money at risk in small business. They have no incentive to expand their businesses. They have no incentive to take any risks. Indeed, the only way to survive in this place is to find one of those featherbedded jobs or get a job in the public sector; get a job on the staff of the Treasurer. But do not go anywhere near a situation where one might actually take a risk and try to make something, develop something or sell something. Our capital gains tax proposal clearly addresses that problem and gives people a very strong incentive to put their money at risk and if they work hard and sustain the performance of those companies after five years they will not pay any capital gains tax on the increased value of their hard work. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, although there has been a peripheral mention of the issue of privatisation in today's statement, the Government has no bona fides on privatisation as well. Just like the Government mouths enterprise bargaining and just like the Government mouths competition, it mouths the word privatisation. But it is all in the mouth, there is no substance to anything the Government says. The Government does not believe in private sector ownership. The Government does not believe in private sector management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's concept of privatisation is driven by just two things: one, `Let us try to milk the existing public sector enterprises to some extent. Let us sell 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and 49 per cent of Qantas. Let us milk them while maintaining public sector control and then let us use that money to go and set up some more public sector enterprises-whether it is Graham Richardson's mad scheme for development in this country or whether it is the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) who has his own ideas of how he is going to build super hospitals or whatever'. The Government is going to build more public sector ownership and more tax burdens down the track. The Government is not interested. The Government is driven by the money for what it can do in terms of the public sector ownership that it seeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Prime Minister's statement today on micro-economic reform-a process, he says, that is `creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the world's best'-we will simply have to sit back and wait for the next 2 1/2 years with ineffective competition as this country falls further into the mire, further off the pace and further behind those in the international community with whom we have to compete, simply because this Government has no concept of micro reform, has no capacity to deliver and is totally hogtied by deals done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions leadership and other special interest groups. This Government governs for the few, never for the people of Australia. It believes in the politics of privilege. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this very grave matter of public importance because of differing public statements by two senior Ministers which have been interpreted by many of us, and most of the press, as sending different messages to people in this country and to our international competitors. I raised both those particular directions in a question in this House earlier today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One was enunciated by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he said earlier this week, in answer to a question on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA>If Australia goes back to the interventionist policies of the past and if it turns in on itself and believes that it can extract wealth from subsidised industries, it will make a grave mistake. </PARA>
<PARA>We all agree. We have all agreed for a long time. However, the Minister for Education, Employment and Training (Mr Dawkins) yesterday advocated quite a different direction-or, if he did not, he advocated a direction that other people outside do not understand. He said, amongst other things, that we should take a step beyond adherence to the principles of the market and the level playing field. I asked the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) to give us the true direction of this Government. He did not answer the question; he simply said that obviously we did not understand about protection and he appeared to fly into some sort of a fury on a basis that was hard to understand. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech to the National Press Club yesterday, as we understand it, and as the press understands it, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said that there should be selective assistance to export industries to replace the assistance that has been given over the last few years and is now being gradually taken away. We agree with the latter course and not the first. In my question to the Minister I was asking whether these two senior Ministers were in fact diverging or whether their statements meant the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said yesterday that he was in favour of supporting those of our best performers who have prospects of doing better and that we required `more subtle measures to encourage the elusive export culture which we so desperately need'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We could look at, for example, the possibility of rating industries in terms of their export orientation as a means of enlisting the commitment of working men and women to this most urgent national effort. </PARA>
<PARA>That is nothing more than picking winners. After many years of long debate in this country on the benefits of free trade, fair trade or laissez faire on the one hand and, on the other, government intervention in its myriad forms-and a thousand points between-we reached a sort of consensus in the early part of the last decade. Its culmination would have to have been the formulation of the Cairns Group of free trading countries. I was at a co-meeting of that meeting which the then Minister for Trade, Mr Dawkins, asked me to convene, or at least to chair. The purpose of the Cairns Group was, and still is, to break down the protective mechanisms in the international trading system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in the Cairns meeting that we needed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to restore some sanity in the agricultural trading system, to put an end to the economic madness now pervading world trade where distortions have reached ludicrous proportions. </PARA>
<PARA>The coalition agreed, most of Australia agreed, and so did nearly everybody else. No-one could put it better than the Prime Minister's speech writer that day in Cairns when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The price efficient traders pay for this corruption is at once stark and massive in its human dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA>The price the subsidisers pay is no less massive, no less human but it is far less obvious in the unnecessarily reduced standards of city dwellers and in the joblessness of more than a million people. </PARA>
<PARA>Everybody agreed-Australia agreed-that the formation of the Cairns Group was one of the most important and outwardly visible culminations of that whole debate. It was probably the most important and was the final consummation, if you like, of the marriage of all the information that was then available-and, I have to say, is now available. </PARA>
<PARA> We justified our stance nationally and internationally by fulminating on the advantages of freer and fairer trade and many people ran around the world, pointing out the inefficiencies of protection and the harm that it did not only to other countries but to the protecting countries themselves. Not only those of us in responsible positions who were involved in trying to sell that policy but also the Ministers themselves were voluble on the subject. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has travelled the world espousing this point of view, not only in other parts of the world but, many times, in this country as well. The Minister for Trade at the time, Mr Dawkins, who, as I said earlier, was responsible for the formation of the Cairns Group-and give him great credit for that-said:</PARA>
<PARA>The protectionist subsidising policies of major industrialised nations have reduced market opportunities for efficient fair traders such as ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>Those sentiments have been repeated a thousand times by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett). </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology then set about to bring that orientation into Australia-although it was, of course, formulated here-along the lines that had been expressed internationally. After a long debate-and that debate had been going for many years-he finally managed to get industry to agree that some of the industries that had been heavily protected should have that protection reduced. Those industries themselves now agree with that course. Why? Because it is true, it is the correct position, it is the understanding everywhere in this country now that protection harms people in other countries-but, more than that, it harms people in the country which is providing that protection. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy for people to say, `We'll go back and look at what happened in the past'. I think what we ought to do is look at the most up-to-date information which has come out of the Industry Commission report, which I think was presented today, so it is hardly out-of-date. It is worth noting what it says. It refers to the Australian Manufacturing Council report of 1990. It states that that report endorses the progressive phasing down of industry protection and the removal of impediments to industrial development. It states that that report also argues for a package of additional measures to assist the manufacturing sector. That report proposes that a link be established between reductions in protection and the use of other measures. The additional measures are seen as necessary to address critical weaknesses of Australian manufacturing industry and to promote the development of firms exporting high value-added manufacturing goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission says it welcomes the attention that the report gives to general ways to improve the competitive position of the economy, but it parts company with the report's advocacy for additional measures to assist selective manufacturing industries. That is a very important statement: it parts company with selective assistance for manufacturing industries. The significance, it says, of the cost that these measures would impose on other industries' activities and taxpayers must be noted. </PARA>
<PARA> We all agreed at the time with the principle of the formation of the Cairns Group, and we all agreed with the direction taken by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) as well. There was no hypocrisy in Australia at that time. We had covered, if you like, our backside in the area of hypocrisy and we had set about a course. In recent times, of course, we have seen a home grown recession. Around the country pressure is being imposed on the Government because of the inexpert performance that it has delivered. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has expanded on that. Suddenly, a senior Minister who is not really responsible for the area that he was speaking about is now taking a step beyond adherence to the principles of the market and a level playing field. What are we to understand from that? Are we to understand that we are now going to cast doubt on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade process or upon the direction that Senator Button commenced some four or five years ago? At the first whiff of economic grapeshot, the fair weather free traders of not so long ago call in the tug boats of intervention to help them. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we wrong? Have we misunderstood what the Minister is saying? If we have misunderstood, so has nearly every newspaper in this country. If the newspapers misunderstand and we misunderstand, it is highly likely that our international competitors and those people who are trying to deal with these matters in Geneva will misunderstand. I feel for the Minister for Trade Negotiations, who at the moment is over there trying to remedy this sort of inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a problem of either an irresponsible statement having been made or of definite inconsistencies within the Cabinet. We have the problem, in my view, of panic. What the Government must do is to look at the past. In this context it is worth thinking, `What we are going to say to the citrus industry?'. It has been told that protection levels must come down. Are we going to say, `Well, don't worry. There are a few large export industries which we have formularised, which we can put in a category and which we know are going to be successful. We are going to help them and you are going to continue to get a reduction in assistance'? What about the textile industry, the clothing industry, the footwear industry, or, indeed, the motor car industry, which has done a very responsible job in the last few years in trying to become internationally competitive?</PARA>
<PARA> We are sending two messages. When we finally understood the debate and the information, we said, `This is the direction in which to go; it is the direction in which to go internationally and nationally'. The last thing we need is an irresponsible Minister who is becoming frightened, worrying about his own constituents at home, coming under pressure from all the people we know are putting him under pressure, and giving these messages all over the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the principle was right at the formation of the Cairns Group. That is why, with great confidence and with great merit, it was able to be formed. It was right then and it is right now. The principle is that competition and not protection is the thing which finally makes A-grade international players. With the correct economic policies-not with interest rates running at 3.3 per cent to total sales in Australia compared to 1.1 per cent in Japan, for example-there is no doubt that one can become an international player if one has the will. We are not going to be internationally competitive with the current wages system. We are not going to be internationally competitive with the current waterfront situation. We are not going to be internationally competitive with the extraordinary lack of competition that was referred to in the Prime Minister's statement on telecommunications. When the ship of state starts to list-and it is going to get worse, thanks to the Government-it seems to me that it is every man for himself. That is an individual decision taken by the various Ministers. What I am saying is that when those Ministers start to run for themselves, they are sending a highly irresponsible message internationally and that must not be allowed. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is sending all the wrong signals. He is changing the direction of a bipartisan building block on which we have worked hard-not just the Government, but many people have worked hard on this-in the last five or six years. Now we have a dual message being given. I can only presume that that dose of political myxomatosis will be cured by the Government as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose this proposition. When one looks at the proposition that is before us, one sees how much the Opposition trivialises this debate. The proposition relates to concern about words spoken from time to time by various Ministers, and concentrates not at all on the actions. Fundamentally, it is the actions that are critical, not the words. I want to identify the actions this Government has taken in making this country much more competitive. That is what the thrust of this proposition is about-that we are not competitive, that we jeopardise our competitiveness because of some wording.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the competitive position in which the Liberal Government left this country in 1982 and see why it was voted out of office in 1983. It maintained an overvalued exchange rate, ostensibly as an anti-inflation weapon, but in the process it drove us to double digit inflation and, at the same time, double digit unemployment. It was a great strategy for an anti-inflation weapon, but the overvalued exchange rate increasingly strangled industry in this country because it meant that this country's production was not competitive. In addition, the previous Government had no wages policy, so a wages explosion was precipitated by its talking up of the resource boom in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has the gall to talk about loose words. Whose were the loose words in 1982 when the resource boom was talked up? The wage outcomes sanctioned by the previous Government were endorsed by the previous Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who is on record as having welcomed the metal industry settlement which the honourable member opposite now wants to denigrate. Let us understand who uttered the loose words. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, those opposite left us with a record fiscal deficit of 4 per cent of gross domestic product. They never touched tariffs in their time in office. The only people who have adjusted tariff levels in this place have been members of Labor governments. Those opposite gave no encouragement to innovation or to value-added. A recipe to strangle industry and to reduce our competitiveness-that is the track record of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, ours has been a coherent strategy to turn all of that around. It is a coherent strategy based upon getting the fundamental macro-economic settings corrected. We have for the first time in this country developed a wages policy in cooperation with the trade union movement-another organisation that members on the other side of the House constantly want to denigrate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Never before has this country had a wages policy. That is the reason why it has never been able to sustain economic growth in periods of buoyancy. By virtue of the lack of a wages policy, it has not had an anti-inflationary strategy. Every time this country has got to a period of strong economic growth it has not been able to sustain it. The benefits have been immediately dissipated in competing wage demands. It was not until the Accord in this country came to be that we were able to produce and deliver non-inflationary wages growth-and not just in the context of recession, because any fool of a government can do it in recession. It is the policy that the Opposition parties ran. They had a recession policy in 1982 and a wages freeze to keep wages down. </PARA>
<PARA> The trick in this game is to produce an anti-inflationary wages policy in times of economic growth and sustain that growth. We have done it. Every year, this Government has produced a wages outcome below the rate of inflation. It is not wages that have been driving inflationary pressures in this country. If honourable members look at the figures they will see that consistently over a period. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, with our fiscal policy we turned that 4 per cent deficit, which the Liberal-National Party left us and which I talked about before, around to a 2 per cent surplus. It is the reason why the international financial community heaps praise on this Government for what it has been able to do in terms of fiscal policy. In terms of monetary policy we had a period in which there were high interest rates. In essence, they were high interest rates because of the strong demand generated in this economy-demand through consumption and demand through investment. We saw the bunching of investment strategies by industry over a very concentrated period in 1988 and we saw strong domestic demand. We got to a position where expenditure growth was doubling the growth of production capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have that situation in an economy, we have to do something to correct it. That is what we are doing. Unless we get to a position in which we can lift our production, we will not be able to sustain strong economic growth into the future. It is an imperative and it is what this Government's mix of macro policies have been designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, they are complemented by a series of strategies of micro-economic reform which the Prime Minister tabled in this House and spoke to not so long ago. It is essentially a combined strategy through micro reform and macro-economic settings to make this economy more competitive and more productive. It is taking it into a global context rather than confining it by the tariff walls which the Liberal-National Party introduced postwar and which made Australia's economy so insular looking. That the Liberal-National Party did that and maintained it for three decades is the reason why it is taking us a long time to turn it around. But we are making progress and we will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House again that the only governments that have taken steps to make this economy more global and more outward looking have been Labor governments. They are the only governments that have tackled tariff reform in this country. Those on the other side, when they had the chance, did nothing. They come into this place and want to preach to us as to where we should be going. We know where we are going; but, more importantly, we have done it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we are winding back the protective wall that the tariff produces because the real problem with the tariff is that it only makes us look internally, domestically. Because of the size of our population, we have to look globally and see the market opportunities for growth in exports, and generate our demand and generate our growth off net exports, whether that be in export growth itself or through competitive import replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background that the Government's strategy is clearly set. It is for that reason also that where there is required to be industry support, where it is clearly justified to achieve that goal, we have given it. In response to a question that the honourable member for Barker asked earlier in the House, I indicated a number of areas in which we have given that support. I am saying that there are many areas in which this Government has introduced what he may term interventionist strategies but which have been applauded by industry and by other sectors of the community for giving an impetus to growth in exports and growth in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> I will run through them. They include the partnerships for development program. Honourable members opposite should go and ask IBM Australia Ltd and those multinationals who under the Opposition's policy were able to get in under a tariff wall to produce for a domestic market what they now think of our strategy which has been prepared to waive offsets-which honourable members opposite would argue is intervention-so long as they commit to export growth and to investment in research and development. They have done it, they have got out of their offset entitlements; but they have reduced the trade deficit in information technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the factor F in pharmaceuticals. There was a mechanism by which we came to grips with the fact that there was a problem for industry development in this country associated with the pricing mechanism attached to pharmaceuticals. We have been prepared to allow that position to adjust, for the manufacturers to charge market prices, again in circumstances in which they commit to production and export and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The accelerated depreciation position in the shipbuilding industry was extended because the shipbuilding industry came to us with a package. Because of the re-crewing arrangements that have been negotiated in the shipping industry, which will bring crews down for every vessel in this country to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards (OECD), because of the skills base and the manufacturing base that have been brought to this country by virtue of the frigate and submarine program-which this Government went out to get-we had a position in which the Australian National Line was prepared to commission a vessel to be built in this country. Not only could it be produced efficiently, but also it could be crewed efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker comes in here with this claptrap, and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) before him, saying that nothing has happened in this area. Why does he not read the damned documents? Why does he not make a proper assessment of what has been going on? In those circumstances the Government was prepared to extend accelerated depreciation as the mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> In the aerospace industry we have operated under an offsets policy. Again it is one that industry has supported in this country. There have been assistance packages in steel, automotive, textile, clothing and footwear, shipping and stevedoring. We even had the honourable member for Barker, in his own submission today, admitting the progress that has been made in the automotive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not have happened if it had not been for our policy initiatives, just as the steel industry would not have grown in terms of exports, would not have enlarged its export base or committed itself to new products and research and development had it not been for the steel industry plan. Honourable members opposite should go and ask the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. They should sit down with the board and understand where the initiatives are coming from and the support that it gives to our policies. </PARA>
<PARA> This suggestion that any form of assistance is bad is absolute claptrap. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Barker that we cannot revert to the position of hiding behind tariff walls. I think the Government is unanimous with the Opposition; I will come to that in a minute. The Government is certainly unanimous on its side that it will not revert. That is the clear message that no-one doubts in the international fora and will be sent to Geneva. Opposition members should not try to confuse it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me come to the assertion that there are differences of opinion in our ranks. The honourable member for Barker questions the statements that have been made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), and I think I answered that in Question Time. Let us have a look at the Opposition's side. In the Australian Financial Review of 26 October, there is the headline: `Key Liberals query policy to abolish tariff protection'. The report starts:</PARA>
<PARA>Senior Liberal Party figures yesterday cast strong doubts over the party's policy to effectively abolish tariff protection by the end of the decade, saying it would kill Australian manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is these senior Liberals John Elliott and John Valder. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the direct challenge, the Opposition industry spokesman and architect of the policy, Mr Ian McLachlan-</PARA>
<PARA>the man who is sitting here and has proposed this matter of public importance in the House today-</PARA>
<PARA>did not directly respond to the criticism when he addressed the council, arguing that there was basic agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What rubbish! He comes in here, parades in this House and says that his policy is to reduce tariffs to zero by the end of the decade, and his own people are querying it. He has got the gall to come into this place and say that there are differences of opinion on our side concerning tariffs. I think that is the height of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare the results of the different strategies, because I think that this is also a telling point, as to where the Opposition's policies left us and where we have come. Inflation is now 6 per cent. Looking at international comparisons-and the Opposition always wants to talk about where the OECD is-we now have an inflation rate of 6 per cent compared to the OECD average of 6.5 per cent. Where is the United States? It is higher, at 6.1 per cent. Where is the United Kingdom, this great model of decentralisation, of free markets, of open labour markets? The United Kingdom has 11.1 per cent inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> What were we left with by the Opposition with its policies? We were left with 11.5 per cent, down now to 6 per cent. Under this Government, gross domestic product growth on average has been 4.2 per cent. When we turfed the Opposition out of office it was a negative 1 per cent. In terms of the balance of payments, imports over the last 12 months, on the most recent figures announced, have dropped by 7.9 per cent while there has been a 3.4 per cent growth in exports. </PARA>
<PARA> We have turned the corner. We have done it because of the policies that we have pursued. There is no disunity on this side. We will sit down and work through the appropriate strategies that this Government will take to get this country going further. We are committed to innovation, new market opportunities, global expansion and growth of net exports, and industry will support us in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important and essential in the present desperate position that Australia is in economically, and that our farmers, rural exports, mineral commodities, manufacturers and small business, which is going down like nine pins, are in, that government policies be both right and consistent. I will have a word about whether they are right in a moment. But in one area where the policies have been right, and where we have generally been supporting the policies of the Government, we have a Minister quite wilfully-and I suggest for party political and electoral reasons-going into a public forum and disagreeing with the agreed bipartisan policy. That is basically what we have had. We have had no answer whatsoever from the Minister at the table to that charge. It is no wonder that he is scuttling from the chamber now after such a miserable effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look precisely at what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said. The editorial in the Australian was quite perspicacious this morning when it said that the Minister for Employment was thinking about something else. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>Frankly, the Government fears for its own political employment. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Australian said, and that is what the Minister was worried about. This is what the Minister said at a time when the Prime Minister said in Question Time that the situation in Geneva was so grave that he himself might go there to lead the negotiations on behalf of Australia. That is the gravity of the situation we are facing, as acknowledged by the Government. This is what the Minister said over at the National Press Club yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA>What we need, as we determine policy for the next decade, is a greater preoccupation with expanding and diversifying our export base. Exports will have to grow faster than imports if we are to achieve the twin goals of a declining current account deficit, and higher levels of employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear, all round! Absolutely! Well said! He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This means taking a step beyond adherence to the principles of the market and a level playing field, important as these principles have been for improving the flexibility and underlying performance of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister seems to be suggesting that the Government ought to rise above, go beyond, principle in this matter. It is rather a curious idea. He then refers to the work of Robert Reich, an American economist. I have met Robert Reich at the Harvard Kennedy School. He is one of these industry interventionist economists. So the very naming of Robert Reich was quite significant and sends a message to the international community which will be lost by nobody. The Minister referred to the words of Reich and said:</PARA>
<PARA>While not being attracted to the terminology, I am attracted to the idea that we cannot leave the fate of the current account merely to chance. We cannot treat exports or employment as the residual consequences of the correct macro-economic settings. </PARA>
<PARA>These words were certainly chosen carefully. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Government's will need to act in a way perhaps resented by the current international orthodoxy. But Australia is different-our economy resembles one from the Third World-</PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid to say that is absolutely true-</PARA>
<PARA>while trying to support the First World aspirations we all share. </PARA>
<PARA>The current international orthodoxy, heaven forbid, is what people are trying to establish in Geneva! It is of grave importance to this country that we open our trade barriers and that every single signal going out from this Government and the Opposition-it has been coming from us-supports the idea of the current international orthodoxy. We should be opening up trade and not introducing barriers, whatever they are-protective devices, tariffs, quotas or any other means of restricting trade. The Minister did this deliberately. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic rationalists argue that if governments set the conditions the private sector will automatically follow and grasp the opportunities.... But what if industry doesn't grasp such opportunities-as is increasingly obvious it hasn't in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is here following the line where people are saying that rational economics have been followed, have not worked and, therefore, we must intervene. The signals on this domestically and internationally are absolutely clear. The Minister knew what he was doing. But why was he doing it? It became clear later on in his speech. He talked about the need to change these policies and to move in a different direction. He said-and this is very significant:</PARA>
<PARA>This also provides us with an opportunity to rebuild an improved rapport with the Party. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is talking about the Australian Labor Party. This Minister was at the Press Club as a leader of the centre left faction; he was making a factional party political speech. Later on in his speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This raises important questions about rebuilding our base and contesting the notion that it's acceptable for our supporters to cast their primary votes elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about people leaving the Australian Labor Party in droves. Many of them are leaving the Labor Party for the Liberal and National parties, casting their votes elsewhere. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This can in part be addressed by the policy approach I have earlier outlined.</PARA>
<PARA>The policy approach he earlier outlined is not the policy approach of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) because my colleague the honourable member for Barker asked the Treasurer a question about this yesterday and got a straight answer. On the same day that this traitor over here was talking to the Press Club--</PARA>

This person put at risk for base political reasons the whole strategy, a national bipartisan strategy, of Australia for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. We have had just about enough of the people over there lecturing our parties on our shortcomings. They have been here for seven and a half years. They sent in here to argue this case the former President of the ACTU who was responsible for the document  Australia Reconstructed. They had the hide to send in here somebody who could support this kind of hogwash, which has been correctly rejected by the Government but which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is trying to sneak in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us realise very clearly that the reason that business is not responding is not that it does not want to respond or that it is hopeless or lazy but that the conditions are simply not there for it to respond. The macro-economic policy settings that the Government talks about are wrong. Inflation is the killer; it is still high and will rise in the next quarter. Until the Government has fixed up inflation, the labour market and these major micro-economic reforms, which it has failed to address adequately in the Prime Minister's statement today, of course business will not respond. Certainly, nobody can respond while Ministers of the Government make conflicting statements, jeopardising some of the most serious negotiations that this country will ever have to conduct internationally-so serious that the Prime Minister says that he is prepared to give up everything else he was going to do and go to Geneva to support his Minister for Trade Negotiations. We support the Minister in those negotiations. We support what the Treasurer said yesterday.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I refer to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The fact is that, when the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) quoted the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins)-I presume it is a direct quote of the Minister-as saying that we should take a step beyond the level playing field, somewhere along the line he missed the point. He seems to assume that this has not always been so. It is we who have spent 7 1/2 years attempting to establish the so-called level playing field. But never in that seven and a half years did we forgo the opportunity for positive and direct intervention by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker should not assume that there is a contradiction here in that we should establish the general principles of the level playing field at the same time as using Government means to intervene so as to improve the competitive aspects of Australian business and to improve exports. So the immediate point is that there is no contradiction whatsoever between the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the remainder of the Government when the Minister emphasises Government intervention, because it is true that we have always used certain tools of Government intervention as well as doing our very best to establish the so-called level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go to the words of the Minister in a moment. But the reporting of a number of newspapers was quite wrong, especially, just to take one, the headline in the Australian this morning of `Dawkins in call for protected industry'. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Employment and Education Minister John Dawkins yesterday called for more government protection . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He clearly did not. I will say what the Minister called for. I have taken the quote from the West Australian and am quite prepared to concede that it is written up accurately. But the Minister said amongst other things that we should do the following things. The first was:</PARA>
<PARA>the removal of the remaining impediments faced by export industries. </PARA>
<PARA>In a sense that is a form of intervention in order to establish some sort of level playing field that we all seem to enjoy and love. The next point was:</PARA>
<PARA>- establishing a ``one shop stop'' fast tracking approval process for major developments rather than the current tortuous path that has to weave its way through the maze of Commonwealth, State and local government regulatory agencies. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not at all inconsistent with what this Government is doing and has been achieving for some years; again, it is a form of Government intervention quite consistent with the rest of the Government. The next point was:</PARA>
<PARA>- continuing to reduce protection . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That hardly warrants the headline, `Dawkins in call for protected industry'. He says clearly that we should continue-I interpose here `the good work of this Government'-to reduce protection and went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ensuring that where assistance is provided, it is directed to exports as well as domestic production. </PARA>
<PARA>The bit that I presume brings the ire of the Opposition is:</PARA>
<PARA>- supporting those of our best performers who have prospects of doing better. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that the offending phrase? I guess it is. Well, it is the same sort of phrase used in this new demon report called The Global Challenge: Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s by Pappas Carter Evans and Koop, et cetera; it uses a similar phrase. I will run through it and then respond. There is no contradiction here. This report has three intersecting circles which form the nub of this global challenge report. The first circle states:</PARA>
<PARA>Increase Exposure to International Competition</PARA>
<PARA>Well, what has the Government been doing for seven and a half years? We have lowered tariff barriers, floated the dollar and freed up the financial institutions. Macro-economic reform went to the very heart of increasing exposure of Australian firms to international competition. So we have already been doing what Pappas Carter recommended. </PARA>
<PARA> The second intersecting circle states:</PARA>
<PARA>Reduce Impediments to Industrial Development</PARA>
<PARA>The whole purpose of our work practices, wages policy and micro-economic reform goes to the heart of reducing impediments to industrial development-again a form of Government intervention. There is no contradiction here. Pappas Carter is quite consistent with the record of the Government and with the comments yesterday of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> The third intersecting circle states:</PARA>
<PARA>Use Positive Measures to Build More Strong Export Firms</PARA>
<PARA>That lines up pretty closely with the Minister's `supporting those of our best performers who have prospects of doing better'. We have done this for seven and a half years. We have had industry packages to support export in, for instance, steel. We have been doing that. There is nothing exceptional about the Minister's statement. In his own portfolio the Minister has been helping to develop the skills formation of the country so that these people can do it. We have assisted research and development--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Kemp" NAMEID="BT4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, if the criticism is that he speaks outside his portfolio, I am not all that worried about that. I am interested in debating the heart of the matter. The heart of the matter is that we have set up again and again research and development through research centres and partnerships for developments. Consistently, we do use forms of Government intervention as positive measures to `build more strong export firms'. We are doing those sorts of things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister wants us to improve our performance, and maybe to do more or whatever. But it is totally consistent with the Government's views and, I might say, with much of what is said in this document entitled The Global Challenge: Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> So the point is that there is no contradiction between the position put by the Minister yesterday and the general flow of the Government's intervention and establishment of a basis for improved exports-none whatsoever. We ought to go to those things that we have achieved and which have been mentioned by others in the debate today. I go to the whole question of inflation. Inflation has always been seen as one of the primary problems for our export sector; that it is difficult for us to compete given that our rates of inflation are higher than our competitors. I agree; it has been so for a long time. Our performance has been poor for 20 years. But I think we should rejoice in the bit of news yesterday that the inflation rate has now fallen decisively and has been moving down over many months because that is precisely the response that we have been asking for. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of government interventions have brought about reduced inflation. We have been working diligently, using all the arms of government intervention, to reduce the general effect of a lower rate of inflation, and the lower rate of inflation will in itself make us more competitive-that magic word-internationally. This is government intervention producing the grounds by which we might become more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> This is nothing new. We have been swimming around doing this for a long time. Would that we had had a greater impact. I do wish all the things we had done had had a greater impact. Honourable members opposite would agree with me that many of the changes we made in 1985-86, especially to free up the financial sector, gave our export sector the best opportunity in 30 years to do better on exports, but it fumbled the ball. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago I remember saying to my Australian Labor Party branches that we were now relying on the intellectual vigour of Australian entrepreneurs to make us more competitive. I remember saying that then, and now I have to go back to them and repeat the words of John Howard yesterday-that they dropped the ball. I am not saying all of them dropped the ball, but many of them were given a unique opportunity to assist this country in its export sector and they failed to do it. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives effect to a number of Government initiatives relating to care for the aged, Medicare, therapeutic goods, and nurse education. In relation to care for the aged, the Bill seeks to amend section 45F of the National Health Act 1953 to provide that a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities for approved nursing homes forms a schedule to the Act. The Bill also seeks to make a similar amendment to section 10DA of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 in relation to a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities for approved hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities for nursing homes and hostels is one of a number of initiatives the Government is currently implementing which aim to ensure that the rights of residents of government-funded nursing homes and hostels are promoted and protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The charter is a statement of the principles that underpin all of this Government's initiatives relating to residents' rights. It reflects the basic belief that people's fundamental rights do not diminish when they move into a nursing home or hostel, regardless of their physical or mental frailty and regardless of their dependence on others for personal care. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of recent debate about the charter, and the associated agreement, I would like to say a few words about the rights it contains. The charter does not give new rights to residents that people in Australian society do not already have, but seeks to retain those basic rights for our frail, aged residents in nursing homes and hostels. Just because an individual has reached a certain level of physical or mental frailty, and requires residential care, does not mean he or she should lose any of the rights and freedoms enjoyed prior to entering a nursing home or hostel. </PARA>
<PARA> The charter is to be enshrined within the legislation to enhance its status as Australian society's definitive statement on the rights of residents in aged care facilities. Embodying the Charter within the legislation will also increase its effectiveness in promoting changes in attitudes about, and perceptions of, the role of older people within society. </PARA>
<PARA> The charter was also tabled earlier this session under the existing provisions in each Act. This was necessary as the existing legislation requires that the resident/proprietor agreement, which was tabled at the same time, be consistent with the charter formulated by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments will repeal the existing provisions relating to formulation by the Minister, and tabling, and will ensure that the charters in the schedules to the Acts will supersede those formulated by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The content, structure and wording of the charter have been the subject of extensive consultation with consumer, industry and union groups and I believe that the final form of the charter reflects a consensus of the views of each group. These initiatives reflect the Government's commitment to `user rights' in aged care, and this Government's desire to ensure that older people retain the right to make decisions about their own lives, regardless of their level of frailty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains two further measures which also relate to Government initiatives regarding aged care. These measures seek to amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 in order to target Commonwealth funds more appropriately. These measures form part of stage 6 of the Government's strategy of aged care reform. Stage 6 includes a range of reforms to the hostels program, including expansion of dementia programs, proper geriatric assessment for people going into hostels and a review of the level of hostel recurrent funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The two further measures in this Bill are: the inclusion of the private sector in the Commonwealth's aged care hostel program; and the abolition, for non-financially disadvantaged, of the hostel care subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let me address the issue of the participation of the private sector in the hostels program. While private enterprise has been a major provider in the nursing home industry over many years, it has not been eligible to participate in the Commonwealth's program for hostels. The Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 has specifically excluded private-for-profit organisations. Under the provisions of this Bill hostel recurrent funding will be available to approved private enterprise organisations. Capital funding will not be available to the private sector for hostels, as is the case with nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to receive recurrent funding, private enterprise organisations will be required to comply with the same requirements as religious and charitable organisations as provided for in the Act and described in the General Conditions. These include the admission of the same proportion of financially disadvantaged persons as would apply for a not-for-profit organisation in the same area, and compliance with the same respite care provisions, residents' rights, outcome standards and architectural standards. However, the General Conditions will be amended to enable private sector organisations to draw some profit from their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The places approved under this initiative will be subject to the Commonwealth's planning ratios. It will be a condition of approval for Commonwealth recurrent funding that all intending residents of those private sector hostels participating in the Commonwealth program be assessed by a geriatric assessment team for their eligibility and need for hostel care. A target of 1,000 private enterprise places has been set for the current financial year and private organisations currently operating hostels will be eligible to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for the non-financially disadvantaged. Payment of hostel care subsidy for those residents who are not financially disadvantaged will be abolished from 9 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, recurrent subsidies are paid to assist organisations to provide services to people requiring hostel accommodation and care. Current arrangements provide for the payment of a hostel care subsidy to all hostel residents assessed as eligible, irrespective of their capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> New funding arrangements were introduced in January 1989 which enable hostels to charge residents entry contributions and ongoing fees according to their ability to pay. Under these new arrangements hostels can receive higher fees from non-financially disadvantaged residents who are better placed to contribute to the costs of their care. </PARA>
<PARA> A range of protections are in place to ensure that all residents retain a set amount of their assets and level of disposable income. These measures are intended to ensure that individuals are protected from any form of financial exploitation. Any resulting loss of funding for hostels can be recovered by the hostel from a combination of fee changes, subject to the controls in the general conditions, and the interest from increased entry contributions from new residents able to contribute more. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been increasing the differential between the hostel care subsidy and the personal care subsidy to encourage hostels to care for an increasing number of frail people. The abolition of the subsidy to those not financially disadvantaged will enable Commonwealth funds to be targeted to financially disadvantaged persons needing hostel care and on those needing a higher level of personal care. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the Government's Budget initiatives, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) announced a full-scale review of the level of recurrent funding for hostels. This review is already under way. In February 1990, the Minister announced that new leave entitlements for nursing home residents would be introduced. This is a further initiative which forms part of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the previous arrangements, residents were entitled to only 28 days leave, which covered both hospital and social leave. These arrangements were a constant source of anxiety for nursing home residents and their families, who feared that if they required an extended stay in hospital, they would lose their place in the nursing home. The new arrangements will be retrospective to 1 March 1990 to allow the payment of Commonwealth nursing home benefits for residents taking hospital leave for an unlimited period, as medically required, and for up to 28 days social leave each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlimited hospital leave is also to be introduced for hostel residents. Amendment to the general conditions for recurrent subsidies in hostels is currently in train. The intention is for unlimited hospital leave for hostel residents to be operational by early 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The two measures together will afford considerable financial protection for residents of nursing homes and hostels who have to undergo hospital treatment, but who wish to retain their bed in the nursing home or hostel. It will also ensure that residents feel secure in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services announced new residential respite care arrangements to be in operation by 1 January 1991. These include allowing nursing home proprietors to charge a booking fee in respect of short term respite care admissions. This measure is part of a package of measures to provide support for the carers of frail older people. </PARA>
<PARA> Other measures in this package include significant real increases in subsidies to nursing homes and hostels for caring for respite residents; changes to enable nursing homes to be approved for a number of respite bed days, instead of a fixed number of beds; and the development of a coordinated booking service for respite care residents through geriatric assessment services. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, proprietors were not entitled to raise any fees associated with the admission of a patient to a nursing home for respite care purposes. Consequently, there was no compensation to the proprietor when a respite booking was not fulfilled. The introduction of booking fees for respite care residents in nursing homes is consistent with the current practice in hostels. Nursing home proprietors will now be able to charge short term respite care residents a booking fee equivalent to 25 per cent of the ongoing cost of the respite stay or one week's respite care fee, whichever is the lesser. The fee is then deducted from the ongoing cost of the respite stay. This should assist the industry and increase the availability of residential respite care services in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment of the Bill is to allow the Minister to establish more than one Nursing Homes Fees Review Committee of Inquiry in a State at any one time. These committees examine requests from nursing home proprietors for review of the scale of fees which has been determined for their nursing home by the Department of Community Services and Health. There are currently over 80 such outstanding requests for review throughout Australia and concurrent sittings by more than one committee may be necessary in some States to avoid delays in the hearing of these requests. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the Health Insurance Act relating to Medicare are contained in parts 3 and 4 of this Bill. The amendments in part 3 relating to diagnostic services are designed to curb a number of unethical practices in the provision of these services, particularly radiology services, by generally restricting the payment of Medicare benefits to those services which have been provided at the request of a practitioner who has no direct financial interest in the ordering of those services. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting to the Senate in November 1986 report No. 260 entitled Medical Fraud and Overservicing-Response to Pathology Fraud, the then Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Senator Georges, expressed the Committee's concern that the problems it had uncovered in the pathology area appeared to be developing in radiology. He noted that some entrepreneurs appeared to be moving to exploit radiology and indicated that the Committee was of the view that it was the joint responsibility of the medical profession and the Government to pre-empt these moves. </PARA>
<PARA> In expressing these views, the Committee was reinforcing concerns about entrepreneurial activity in the provision of radiology services previously expressed by the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists. The College had claimed that medical entrepreneurs were responsible for the emergence of self-referral radiology and other arrangements designed to encourage excessive services. </PARA>
<PARA> Professional and government concerns about the rate of growth in the provision of diagnostic imaging services, and some of the reported arrangements surrounding their provision, led in 1987 to the then Minister for Health establishing a departmental diagnostic imaging services review to examine ways of controlling the provision of these services. The services covered by this review included diagnostic radiology, computerised tomography (CT) scanning, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear scanning. The amendments in part 3 of the Bill before the House today reflect the outcome of the review and the consultative process with relevant professional organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal features of the legislation are the introduction of a formal mechanism for the requesting of diagnostic imaging services, the specification of activities which are deemed to be prohibited diagnostic imaging practices, the consideration of suspected breaches of those prohibited practices by a Medicare participation review committee, and the notification of suspected breaches of State and Territory radiation licensing laws to the relevant State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation introduces a number of control measures designed to effect an arms-length referral arrangement in the provision of diagnostic imaging services. Some of these control measures are similar to those which have applied to pathology services for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principle underlying this legislation is the requirement that for a diagnostic imaging service to attract a Medicare benefit, the service should, except in a limited number of defined situations, be specifically requested by one practitioner from another coupled with the requirement that there be financial distance between the requesting and providing practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Services which have traditionally been seen as falling within the competence of general practitioners remain unaffected by the new arrangements. X-rays of the extremities, chest, abdomen and the shoulder will continue to attract benefits when performed on a practitioner's own patient. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, then, a Medicare benefit will be payable only when, prior to commencing the investigations associated with the service, the providing practitioner has received a signed and dated written request from the referring practitioner who does not stand to gain financially from that referral. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a formal referral arrangement requires that the legislation specify the practitioners who are entitled to request diagnostic imaging services. The legislation stipulates that these practitioners are doctors, dentists and chiropractors. Whereas there is no limit to the range of services which may be requested by doctors, dentists are to be restricted to X-rays of the head and chiropractors to X-rays of the spine. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions from the general referral arrangements will apply in certain circumstances. These include emergencies, lost requests, services rendered in remote areas, and services rendered by specialists which fall within their specialty. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that in certain areas of Australia, particularly remote rural areas, reasonable access to doctors specialising in diagnostic imaging services is not possible. In addition, there is no choice of general practitioner. In these circumstances, even if a general practitioner owned suitable equipment and could interpret diagnostic images, it could be impossible for those services to be provided in response to a request from an independent practitioner. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, therefore, provides for exemptions from the referral provisions to be granted to diagnostic imaging service practitioners who practise in areas designated as remote for the purposes of the legislation and who can demonstrate that their patients would suffer undue hardship if the exemption was not granted. Exemptions will apply only to referred services for which there are no corresponding non-referred items and will normally be given only when the practitioner can demonstrate that no other practitioner in the area is equipped or able to provide diagnostic imaging services. In addition, visiting diagnostic imaging services, if any, must not be able to adequately meet the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions will be effective for a period of three years with provision for renewal for further periods of three years. The exemption may be terminated if other adequate diagnostic imaging facilities become available in the area to enable the referral arrangements to operate without causing undue hardship to patients. However, the exempt practitioner has at least six months to demonstrate why the exemption should remain in force. The precise definition of `remote area' has yet to be determined in consultation with the relevant medical organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Practitioners suspected of breaching the legislation will firstly be advised of the concerns about their practice. If they do not respond or if the concerns are not adequately explained, the legislation provides for the Minister to refer these matters to a Medicare participation review committee acting as a committee of peers. These committees, chaired by a legal practitioner of at least five years standing, will include four medical practitioners who must be experienced in the provision of diagnostic imaging services. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare participation review committees will be empowered to make determinations ranging in severity from no action being taken, to counselling or reprimanding the person, to not paying or recovering Medicare benefits for the services in question, to disqualifying the practitioner from all or some of the diagnostic imaging services he or she is qualified to perform. These determinations may be reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> A provision has also been included to recover Medicare benefits for services rendered contrary to relevant State or Territory legislation regarding radiation equipment licensing or registration, safety or quality standards for radiological equipment or the operation of radiological equipment. Any recovery of benefits is to be from the person found to have contravened such legislation, not from the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation has the support of the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists, the Australian Medical Association and, subject to the inclusion of a temporary `grandparent' exemption clause for general practitioners who are currently rendering services which are to be designated as referred items, of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The College of General Practitioners is keen to ensure adequate protection for those general practitioners who currently provide diagnostic imaging beyond the limited range of the proposed unreferred items and who might not qualify for the proposed area exemption. An amendment is currently proposed to be moved during the debate on this legislation to incorporate such a provision. This would exempt, until 1 January 1993, certain radiology services provided by those general practitioners from the application of the referral requirements. Any exemption beyond that date will depend on the College of General Practitioners being able to develop an adequate accreditation and quality assurance program which has the support of other relevant medical organisations and which is able to establish the appropriateness of general practitioner radiology in terms of quality, efficiency, safety, and cost. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains amendments relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for pathology services. These amendments are designed to allow referral of cases of excessive pathology services to the Medical Services Committee of Inquiry and will give appeal rights to scientists and senior scientists whose classifications affect their employment in pathology laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, cases involving the initiation of excessive pathology services by providers are required by the Act to be referred to the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC). However, this has been found to be an inappropriate and ineffective mechanism for dealing with such cases. All other cases of excessive servicing involving general-that is non-pathology-medical services are referred to a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry (MSCI), and this is considered to be the appropriate body to consider pathology cases, at least in the initial stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Under current legislation, MPRCs determine whether a practitioner who has been convicted of a relevant offence or other pathology matters should continue to be allowed to participate in the Medicare arrangements. In this case, the MPRC process is the ultimate sanction against providers who may be in breach of the Medicare legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience in this area suggests that it would be more appropriate for all matters involving excessive servicing to be initially referred to the Medical Services Committees of Inquiry. The power of these Committees is limited to making recommendations to the Minister that, where a provider has been found to have rendered excessive services, the provider be reprimanded, counselled or be required to repay Medicare benefits incorrectly claimed. It is necessary to retain the right to refer to an MPRC a pathologist who has been the subject of more than two Ministerial determinations from an MSCI which would tend to indicate that the person was a recidivist offender. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Minister gave an undertaking to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to give appeal rights to scientists and senior scientists who have been refused the appropriate classification-in relation to employment in a pathology laboratory-when the Minister considers an application for approval of premises as an accredited pathology laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA> To carry out this undertaking, it is necessary to provide definitions of scientist and senior scientist in the Act. A new section 23dna is proposed setting out these definitions. Appeal rights, firstly to the Minister and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, are set out in an amendment to section 23do of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also amends the definition of `medical practitioner' as defined in section 3 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 to exclude from the Medicare arrangements medical practitioners who have been deregistered or delicensed following an inquiry by a State or Territory medical board. </PARA>
<PARA> Up to the present, some practitioners holding registration in more than one State or Territory, having been deregistered by a State or Territory medical registration board following an inquiry, have been able to continue to practise in States other than the one in which the deregistration occurred and to attract Medicare benefits for services so rendered. The Government believes that this is inappropriate and in the absence of uniform registration procedures has moved to ensure that deregistered or delicensed practitioners will no longer have access to the Medicare arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is designed to prevent services rendered by medical practitioners who have been deregistered or delicensed from attracting Medicare benefits for professional services rendered anywhere in Australia for the period of the deregistration-delicensing in that State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment imposes no obligation on the States. Where a medical practitioner, although deregistered in one State, continues to be registered in another, such practitioner would be able to practise-for example, in a salaried position-in the State or Territory in which he or she has registration. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, section 3c of the Health Insurance Act enables the Minister for Community Services and Health to determine that a health service and its associated fee, which are not listed in the Medicare benefits schedule, shall be treated for the purpose of the health legislation as if that health service and fee were included in the schedule. The new legislation does not alter the Minister's powers or responsibilities in this regard, but provides that, following a reference to it by the Minister, the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee may consider and make recommendations to the Minister as to the manner and extent of treatment or treatments. The relating fee or fees should be determined by the Minister to be a specified health service for the purposes of section 3c. The expert advice of the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee will be of considerable benefit in this process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains an amendment to include the most relevant provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 in the Health Insurance Act for the purposes of prosecutions under the Health Insurance Act. In the course of prosecutions, it is often more appropriate to charge practitioners with offences under the Crimes Act 1914. However, as a number of offences under the Crimes Act are not specifically referred to in the definition of relevant offence, some practitioners have avoided prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains further amendments to update the Health Insurance Act to take account of the implementation of the administrative review mechanisms established under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and rectifies a minor typographical mistake in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes amendments to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act 1985. That Act currently provides for the Commonwealth to make financial assistance available to the States and Territories for students in diploma courses in higher education institutions leading to registration as a nurse. It has now been decided that, in future, basic nurse education courses may be granted degree status where they meet the relevant criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed to the States Grants (Nurse Education Transfer Assistance) Act will extend Commonwealth financial assistance to the States and the Territories to three years of these degree level courses for people who are not registered or eligible to be registered as a nurse. </PARA>
<PARA> Two amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 are proposed. The first clarifies that the sponsor of therapeutic goods is a person in Australia. The second amendment restricts aggregation of therapeutic devices with common characteristics to those which also have a common manufacturer. Aggregation is used primarily for grouping goods together for entry into the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989 the Government undertook a major review of the management of Commonwealth fisheries. This review culminated in the release of a policy statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) titled New Directions for Commonwealth Fisheries Management in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy statement placed particular emphasis on the need to ensure that fisheries resources are not over exploited and that any exploitation is at a level which can be sustained while maintaining the surrounding environment; commercial fishing operations are economically efficient, using the most appropriate technology to achieve the greatest net returns; and fishermen make an appropriate payment to the community for the right to exploit a public resource for private gain, provided that new profits are generated and that the industry has the capacity to make such a payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy statement also emphasised that the administration of Commonwealth fisheries should be established on the most efficient and effective basis. Taken together, these management objectives emphasise the importance of maximising economic efficiency, but are always constrained to protect resources. These objectives are entirely consistent with the Government's policy of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy statement identified the existence of substantial excess fishing capacity as the main factor inhibiting the attainment of these management objectives. In order to address this problem the Government gave a commitment that it would assist the fishing industry to reduce overcapacity, as long as it was convinced that this would help the fishery concerned to become more profitable. The statement also indicated that this assistance would be provided on a fishery by fishery basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Prawn Fishery is the most valuable fishery managed by the Commonwealth. For the past few years operators in the Northern Prawn Fishery have experienced financial difficulty. This has been largely caused by considerable excess capacity in the fishing fleet and a sharp reduction in world prawn prices due to competition from farm grown prawns, mainly originating from South East Asian countries. A poor Australian banana prawn catch this year has aggravated this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is general agreement by industry that there needs to be a significant reduction in fishing effort to restore the fishery to profitability. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that if the capacity of the fleet was halved, the profitability of the fishery would increase significantly from the current negative levels of about $40m to positive levels of about $20 million per year or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore the possibility of too much fishing effort damaging the prawn stocks is always a concern. At present the prawn stock does not appear to be in danger, but this could change relatively quickly. Only five years ago Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation scientists were most concerned about this and the Government, with industry support, implemented gear restrictions and extended seasonal closures and bans on daylight trawling to protect the stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons it was decided that it was appropriate for it to be the first fishery to be restructured. A joint government-industry task force was established and, together with the Northern Prawn Fishery management committee, a restructuring package was developed. Throughout the process the industry was widely consulted and there were a number of meetings with fishermen at the principal ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The assistance package which the Government has agreed to will build upon the voluntary adjustment scheme that was introduced in late 1985. The original scheme did succeed in reducing capacity, but became increasingly expensive and was too slow in achieving the necessary level of restructuring. The new package is also based on providing incentives to industry to restructure through a buy-back program, but there are important differences from the old approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The first difference is that there is a fixed target size for the fishery of 50,000 fishing units to be achieved by the beginning of the 1993 fishing season. Experience has demonstrated that for restructuring schemes to be successful a fixed target is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics projections indicate that the most efficient level of exploitation would be achieved with a fleet size of less than 40,000 units, the management advisory committee for the Northern Prawn Fishery and the Government have agreed to a target of 50,000 units. If the target is not met, a pro rata compulsory surrender with special provision for single boat operators will be implemented to bring the number of units down to 50,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major difference is that the voluntary buy-back part of the scheme will only operate for a short, sharp, three month period at the beginning of 1991. There will be a fixed price for fishing units and a compensation payment, referred to as a redundancy payment, which will be paid when fishermen take their boats out of the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA> To fund the buy-back the Government will provide a guarantee for a commercial loan of up to $40.9m, to be repaid over 10 years. The Government will also provide a grant of $5m over three years from the national fisheries adjustment program to assist the industry to repay the loan in the initial years while the increased profits in the fishery are building up. This Bill will amend the existing Act to reflect the new loan guarantee. The loan repayments will be funded by a levy which will be collected twice yearly from the northern prawn fishermen. The Fisheries Levy (Northern Prawn Fishery Regulations) will be amended to make these collections. Amendments will also be made to the northern prawn fishery management plan to allow the whole package to be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made no secret of the fact that it expects the industry to share some of the new profits which result from this restructuring with the wider community. However the Government will ensure that any community return charges which it requires industry to pay do not destroy incentives. The Government's view is that where genuine new profits are made arising from the exploitation of a community resource for private gain the industry will share a portion of those profits with the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise that the Government realises it is important to take account of all costs when calculating these profits to avoid creating a cost burden for the industry. The community return legislation, which will give effect to this policy, is an integral part of this package and will be introduced in the autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> While fishermen will not welcome the requirement to pay a community return it is fair to say that they recognise that the fishery will be considerably more profitable after the restructuring, even allowing for the new payment of a community return. Members of the northern prawn fishing industry have been most helpful in the provision of advice during the development of this restructuring scheme and have supported the totality of the restructuring package outlined above. Many of their suggestions are embodied in these arrangements. An industry-government committee has been established to ensure a continuing high degree of consultation. With this assistance and cooperation, I expect a smooth transition for this structural adjustment initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Pipeline Authority (Charges) Bill 1990 is the first step in the implementation of the Government's decision to commercialise and sell the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system. This sale is an essential component of the Government's program of major asset sales. This program commenced in 1987 and to date has generated gross proceeds of $2.8 billion, with a further $1000m, or $1 billion, in prospect this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the sales program has been a major contributor to the restraint in government outlays over recent years, and the pipeline sale will make a major contribution to the $8.1 billion Budget surplus this year. The measures in this Bill will improve the efficiency of the pipeline. They are thus consistent with the Government's broad micro-economic reform objectives, in particular those relating to the performance of basic economic infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to sell the pipeline was taken in the 1989-90 Budget. During that year a large number of expressions of interest to purchase the pipeline were received. The Government subsequently announced in the 1990-91 Budget that the operations of the pipeline system would be placed on a proper commercial basis, prior to its sale. The Government acknowledges that in introducing this Bill it has been necessary to address a number of difficult issues, ones which a government less determined to address Australia's fundamental economic problems might well have sought to avoid. But hard decisions are needed in the current economic environment if we are to make our economy more efficient. Further, we cannot as a responsible Government, call upon the States to get their houses in order if we ourselves are not prepared to show a lead. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is designed to remedy a fundamental defect in the arrangements by which the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system is operated-and to do so in a way which is fair to all parties. The present haulage tariff arrangements between the Pipeline Authority, which operates the pipeline system on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) are not commercially based. They do not provide for the Authority to earn any overall profit on the bulk of its business until the year 2006, and to earn only inadequate profits over the following 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, under current contract arrangements it is not possible to earn a proper economic return on the pipeline's full current value. In effect, the Commonwealth-or rather, taxpayers generally-are subsidising the transportation and consumption of gas in New South Wales. In this regard it has been claimed that the existing haulage arrangements should be only a debt servicing device because taxpayers have no equity in the pipeline system. Such a claim highlights precisely what is wrong with the current arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> While the depreciated historical cost of the pipeline is about $250m, its current value is well in excess of this amount. An indication of this is that the replacement cost of the pipeline today is around $1.3 billion. Its current value, as measured by the depreciated replacement cost, would therefore be several hundred million dollars above its depreciated historical cost. As anyone running a business responsibly will acknowledge, the difference between depreciated historical cost and current value represents the latent equity of taxpayers in the pipeline system on which it is appropriate to expect a commercial return. This point was eloquently made by AGL Petroleum (AGLP) in a recent submission to the Industry Commission inquiry into energy generation and distribution, where it was stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> AGLP agrees with the Commission's comment that tariffs based only on historical costs erode the capital base needed to provide ongoing pipeline capacity. Further, the owners of any commercial facility such as a pipeline are entitled to a return on the value of their investment. This approach is becoming more common as Governments and Government Authorities set tariffs for the provision of energy and other services to their consumers having regard for the current value of their capital investment in providing those services.</PARA>
<PARA> Pipelines are long-lived assets. The value of money, due to inflation, changes significantly over the life of the asset as does the value of the asset, both in terms of its market value and the cost of partial or total replacement. Historic cost accounting methods are therefore inappropriate when applied to returns on long lived assets, whether pipelines, manufacturing assets, or public infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent Federal and State Government initiatives have been taken to `corporatise' various publicly-owned assets and to examine the returns appropriate to the particular asset. The results of these examinations have shown a strong consensus that the evaluation of returns on the current or market values of the enterprise's assets are more appropriate rather than on their historic value. This is appropriate in AGLP's view. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, this is also appropriate in the Government's view, which is why this legislation is now before the House. The key to putting the pipeline system onto a proper commercial basis is to increase the existing haulage tariffs charged by the Pipeline Authority-and subsequently the new owner of the pipeline system. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of those pipelines where no profit component is incorporated in the current haulage tariff the provisions of this Bill will increase the existing haulage tariff by 25 per cent from 1 January 1991 and by a further 25 per cent from 1 January 1992. This comprises the main trunk line between Moomba in the north east of South Australia and Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney and the lateral pipelines to Cootamundra, Wagga Wagga, Bathurst, Orange, Lithgow and Junee. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus on 1 January 1991, the existing haulage tariff will increase from 80c to $1 per gigajoule of gas carried by the Pipeline Authority, and then increase further to $1.25 per gigajoule on 1 January 1992. In the absence of these provisions the tariff would increase to 82c and then 84c per gigajoule on the dates indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> The two lateral pipelines to Canberra and Oberon are the subject of specific agreements between the Pipeline Authority and AGL that already allow for some profit margin to be earned, having regard to normal commercial principles. In these cases it is proposed to give the Authority (and subsequently the new owner of the pipeline system) the opportunity to determine in consultation with AGL whether the existing haulage tariffs charged for gas transported to those destinations should be increased by some lesser percentage than 25 in each of the next two years. In the event that no such agreements are reached on the alternative increases to apply, the haulage tariffs applicable to these two lateral pipelines as from 1 January of each year concerned will be determined by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that overriding the present unsatisfactory pricing provisions in the existing contractual arrangements between AGL and the Pipeline Authority is a very significant step for the Government to take. I can assure the House that it is not one which was taken lightly. In normal circumstances the Government would be loath to alter such contractual arrangements. However, the imperative of achieving economic reform in Australia today means that difficult decisions must be taken for the good of the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The haulage tariff adjustments proposed by this Bill are the only feasible way to ensure that the economic efficiency of gas marketing arrangements is improved. They are essential if Australian taxpayers are to obtain a fair and reasonable return on the current worth of this extremely valuable asset. Without these adjustments to improve the commerciality of the pipeline system, the likely sale price would fall well below any reasonable assessment of its current value. The shortfall, on current indications, could well be several hundred million dollars. This Government is not prepared to short change the community in that way. Without adjustments to the haulage tariff of this order the Government would withdraw the pipeline system from sale and not support a future sale until the current haulage agreements are appropriately modified. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of provisions in the Bill are designed specifically to ensure that AGL is treated fairly. These provisions relate to freedom for AGL to determine how the increased haulage cost is passed on to its customers and the inclusion of detailed compensation arrangements for reductions in profit resulting from price increases. It is not possible at this stage to state precisely what effects these haulage tariff increases will have on prices charged to individual gas consumers in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory-be they industrial, commercial or domestic users. This is because such increases will be decided by AGL in accordance with its commercial judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> However, haulage tariffs represent only a small proportion of the final gas prices charged to consumers, which means that the percentage increase in final gas prices will be dramatically less than the proposed increases in the haulage tariff. Indeed, the average increase in final gas prices charged to all consumers in New South Wales as a direct consequence of the two proposed 25 per cent increases in haulage tariffs is not expected to exceed 4 per cent in each of the two years. The average increases likely to apply in the case of gas transported through the Canberra and Oberon pipelines will be less than this. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be expected, however, that the price to all consumers will increase by the average percentage price increase. This is partly because gas prices vary substantially as between major industrial users, smaller industrial users, and commercial and domestic users, with the former enjoying far lower prices than the latter. A 20c per gigajoule increase for major industrial users would therefore be a much larger percentage increase than the same 20c increase to domestic consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, it seems reasonable to expect, for example, that in recognition of the inherent price sensitivity of some of the major industrial users of gas in New South Wales, AGL may decide to insulate, at least in part, certain segments of the gas market from the full effects of these haulage tariff increases. This would mean that other sectors of the market with much lower price elasticities of demand would have to bear a more than proportional share of the additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Prices for commercial and domestic consumers are considerably higher than prices for industrial consumers, so if the costs associated with the haulage tariff increases were flowed through evenly the resultant percentage increase for them would be less than the average. However, the outcome may well be quite different. For instance, if industrial users as a group were required to bear only about two-thirds of their share of the increased haulage costs, the resultant increase in price to commercial and domestic users over the two years would be around 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted the claims attributed to AGL that, as a consequence of the need to protect some industrial users, prices in other sections of the market could rise by up to 25 per cent. I want to make it clear to the House that this claim cannot be substantiated. There is simply no reasonable basis on which to translate an average price rise of 4 per cent in each of the next two years into an increase of 25 per cent for any significant sector of the market. Indeed, if AGL were to seek to impose increases of anything like this order the Government would have no hesitation in referring the matter to the Prices Surveillance Authority forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the impact of the probable price increases on domestic consumers is likely to be quite small in monetary terms. Updated Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure statistics indicate that the average gas bill of households on mains gas in Sydney is currently about $225 per annum. Accordingly, a 9 per cent increase, for instance, would amount to about 40c per week. So the increase in the average weekly domestic gas bill by 1992 as a result of this legislation is likely to be less than the cost of a daily newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that AGL's position is appropriately protected, this legislation will have the effect of setting aside any existing State legislation, or any contractual arrangements, which might otherwise prevent AGL from recovering the proposed haulage tariff increases in higher gas prices to consumers. However, it is proposed that further discussions be held with the New South Wales Government to determine whether a more targeted approach to existing State legislation could achieve the Commonwealth's objectives. If that proves to be the case, the Government intends to use the scope which exists under this legislation to reinstate by proclamation part or all of the existing State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further measure in support of the Government's wish to treat AGL fairly, the Bill before the House also provides explicitly that in the event that AGL can demonstrate that it has suffered a loss of profit as a consequence of a reduction in demand for gas due to the haulage tariff increases proposed-and provided that AGL has taken all possible steps available to it to mitigate the extent of that loss of profit by seeking alternative markets for the gas-there is a mechanism whereby AGL would be able to claim compensation from the Commonwealth. Let me add that the Government does not expect that the compensation payable, if any, would be significant. Substantial rises in field prices for gas were awarded by arbitrators to the gas producers in 1983 and 1987 without any significant fall in the demand for gas. In fact, increases in the field price of gas of around 45 per cent and 55 per cent occurred without undermining the viability of manufacturing industry generally or the market for gas in New South Wales. Indeed, the best advice available to the Government is that significant continued natural growth can be expected in the market for gas, which in these environmentally conscious times has promising future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government does not expect that significant compensation will be payable to AGL. This will be especially so when assessed in the context of the potential benefits to the Budget, and hence taxpayers, that will result from the additional revenues which will flow to the Pipeline Authority as a consequence of the commercialisation of its operations or, subsequently, the achievement of a price for the sale of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system which would better reflect its true value. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that purchase proposals are currently under examination by the Government. The indications are that the adjustments proposed in this Bill will enable us to secure a realistic sale price for the pipeline system. The Government intends to introduce further legislation at a later time to regulate the operation of the pipeline system after its sale in order to ensure that unfair advantage is not taken of its monopoly position and to prevent possible exploitation of consumers by the new owner. Two alternative regulatory regimes are being considered and prospective purchasers of the pipeline system have been invited to submit bids on the basis of each of them. The final decision on this matter will be taken in due course in the light of the responses received and after consulting other interested parties, including the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I repeat that the essential purpose of this Bill is to put the operations of the Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline system on to a sound commercial footing, consistent with the broad thrust of the policy focus of this Government to commercialise the operations of all of its business enterprises and so promote a more efficient allocation of resources in the national economy. In pursuing this significant element of economic reform, moreover, the Government is seeking an outcome which is fair to all parties: to AGL, to consumers and, of course, to the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Builders Labourers' Federation Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 proposes an extension of the period during which the Australian Building Construction Employees and Builders Labourers Federation or any equivalent association is excluded from applying for registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the current Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration) Act 1986, that period will expire on 14 April 1991. This Bill, among a number of other matters, proposes that the period be extended for a further five years until 14 April 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is introducing this Bill in an attempt to ensure industrial peace in the building and construction industry. There is no doubt in the Government's view that the attitudes and behaviour of the Builders Labourers Federation (BLF) have not changed in the past 4 1/2 years and it continues to be a threat to law and good order in the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the cancellation of registration legislation, the BLF may not be registered under the Federal Act unless the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is satisfied that the association would not engage in conduct inimical to the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no doubt that the Federation would be unable to meet this requirement. Our experience in the past clearly demonstrates this. The period of deregistration of the Federation from 1974 until 1976 did not result in any noticeable change in the behaviour of the union when it was again allowed to operate in the Federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> Attempts were made in the early 1980s to have the Federation deregistered once again. This process was not completed. In 1985 the Government introduced the Building Industry Act to provide for a review of the behaviour of the Federation by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Following the review, in 1986 the Commission found that the Federation should be deregistered in the light of an overwhelming case that the Federation had continued its record of unlawful behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation introduced in 1986 deregistered the Federation for a period of five years. This was done in the hope that the Federation would learn that the type of industrial behaviour it adopted had no place in the Federal industrial relations system and that it would therefore alter that behaviour. In fact, the Federation has not altered its behaviour in the slightest. </PARA>
<PARA> In Melbourne, this year alone, there has been a series of incidents, which are still continuing, in which building workers have been constantly harassed through violence by BLF officials. Since the BLF was deregistered in 1986, there have been more than 100 convictions against BLF officials in Victoria. The crimes for which convictions have been recorded include: trespass, assault, assaulting police, resisting arrest, contempt of court, receiving secret commissions, wilful damage, defacing property, and theft. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> More recent examples are incidents at 417 St Kilda Road and other sites where police protection alone has cost the Victorian taxpayer in excess of $1m and costs generally to industry are in excess of $15m. </PARA>
<PARA> This dispute arose over a claim for payment of lost time. An unofficial picket was mounted in June 1990 at BLF instigation. The picket indulged in persistent and premeditated violence against workers on site and against police. Nuts, bolts and rocks were thrown at the workers and at trucks making deliveries to the site. Contractors and their families were harassed. BLF organisers defied court orders and were gaoled in July and August for contempt of court. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, members of the picket have continually disrupted weekly meetings of the Victorian Trades Hall Council and vandalised the historic Trades Hall building. BLF officials have also organised pickets at other sites operated by Leightons Contractors in Melbourne. One of these sites is the extremely important Commonwealth Serum Laboratories building project in Broadmeadows. These pickets are not supported by the Victorian Trades Hall Council or the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in New South Wales there have been many arrests of BLF members for trespass, assaults and causing damage to property. In May 1986 New South Wales BLF supporters caused the May Day rally to be abandoned because of assault to Building Workers Industrial Union officials. Police had to restore order. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales BLF officials have regularly been arrested from 1986 to date for trespass and assault on building sites. BLF members have regularly disrupted work on building sites in Sydney by staging sit-ins on cranes. In June 1988 the Federal Court granted orders precluding the BLF from entering 11 building sites in Sydney. The entire trade union movement, employers and the Victorian Government have joined forces in an attempt to ensure that the BLF does not succeed in such campaigns of unacceptable and abhorrent industrial behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of incidents such as these, any suggestion that the BLF has changed its ways is ludicrous. We could sit back, take no action and allow the BLF to continue this campaign of industrial lawlessness while the Australian Industrial Relations Commission once again listened to the Federation put a case for registration under the Industrial Relations Act. There is little doubt what the outcome of such proceedings would be. There is no place for the Federation in the Federal system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted that suggestions have been made in some quarters that an inquiry of some kind should be conducted into these matters. In the Government's view, such a suggestion cannot be seriously considered in this case. The necessity for such action has been vitiated by events which have been observed and condemned by the broad community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federation's record speaks for itself. To allow registration proceedings in the Commission or to conduct an inquiry would play into the hands of the Federation, which would use any delay in the Government's dealing with it as an opportunity for it to continue its disruption and violence against others in the industry. It would pursue a forceful recruitment campaign and exert all the industrial muscle it could muster to maintain and defend its influence in the building industry. The building industry could not withstand the financial and other costs incurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would be remiss if it invited breaches of law and order in the industry through delay or hesitancy. It cannot afford to gamble on the chance that the Federation would change the habits of many years and act responsibly during any delay. </PARA>
<PARA> The tactics used at the St Kilda Road site are reminders of what the Federation would attempt if there was a chance of again asserting its influence in the Federal industrial relations arena. It is the branches of the BLF in Victoria and New South Wales which present the greatest danger to the building industry. These are the branches which have been isolated from the formal industrial relations framework at both the Federal and State levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, to allow full participation in the Federal system by any part of the Federation, even by its branches in those States where it remains registered at the State level, is to invite the militant faction of the Federation to attempt to gain entry to the Federal system through those State branches. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments proposed by this Bill will, however, give some recognition to the more moderate State branches while ensuring that the irresponsible elements are denied access to the formal system of industrial relations existing at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Bill to explain how the Government proposes to achieve this goal. I do not intend to go into the provisions of the Bill in any great detail, as the explanatory memorandum to the Bill gives a very comprehensive explanation of each clause provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The main provisions of the Bill will amend the Builders Labourers' Federation (Cancellation of Registration-Consequential Provisions) Act 1986 to achieve three important objectives. The prohibition on any application for registration by the Federation or any other non-registered association will be extended for an extra period of five years, until 14 April 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the definition of `non-registered association' will be expanded to include an association, a substantial number of the members of which perform work which would make those members eligible for membership of the Federation or which would have made them eligible for membership of the Federation prior to the cancellation of its registration. Associations will come within the definition if the work performed would make the members eligible for membership of the Federation anywhere in Australia. The rules concerning eligibility differ between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The final objective of the proposed amendments is to provide a limited right of intervention before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by all State registered branches of the BLF; namely, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The New South Wales branch is not able to participate in the New South Wales State industrial system. In Victoria, legislation denies the BLF recognition before the State Industrial Commission. In the Australian Capital Territory only the Federal system applies. </PARA>
<PARA> The specified State branches of the Federation will be able to seek leave to intervene before the Commission to present submissions in matters in which the Commission might exercise its powers not to hear or determine an industrial dispute under section 111 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. This right of intervention is limited to matters in which the Commission might dismiss or not deal with a matter because the matter is trivial, it can be more properly dealt with by a State industrial authority, or because further proceedings are not desirable or necessary in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, those State branches will have the same rights of objection as other registered organisations in proceedings concerning the registration, amalgamation or alteration of eligibility rules of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative action proposed by the Government will not prevent the Builders Labourers Federation continuing to exist as a trade union, or continuing to operate in those State industrial systems in which the branches of the Federation are registered or recognised. The proposed legislation will prevent the BLF from operating in the formal Federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> Registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 is voluntary and brings with it a number of rights and obligations. The conduct of the BLF was inimical to the objectives of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, which was the predecessor to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It was that unlawful conduct which caused the Government to cancel the registration of the BLF under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparent that the conduct of the BLF would not be any different if it was allowed back into the formal Federal industrial relations system. Experience with the Federation's deregistration has clearly demonstrated that its removal from the system does not cause it to alter its behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, registration under the Industrial Relations Act 1988 brings both benefits and obligations. The BLF has consistently taken the benefits and ignored the obligations. Unless an organisation is willing to accept the obligations placed upon it by Federal registration it should not be able to gain the benefits of the registration. </PARA>
<PARA> I must reiterate, however, that the Government's proposed legislative amendments will not prevent the Federation from continuing to exist as a trade union or prevent its members from remaining members of the Federation. The amendments will simply remove the ability of the Federation, or any equivalent association, to participate in the formal industrial relations framework established by the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as the objectives of the Federation are clearly inimical to the system established by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government finds absolutely no joy in having to take the action that this Bill proposes. We are a Labor government. We derive great satisfaction and great strength from our connection with the Australian labour movement. It was a Labor government which brought about the ratification of International Labour Organisation conventions Nos 87 and 98 more than 17 years ago. In their application to Australia, these conventions seek to protect the rights of Australians to organise and to join and participate freely in the activities of trade unions. This Government is a staunch and energetic defender of these rights. But, as I said a moment ago, with the right to organise comes the obligation to observe the law. It is the Federation's refusal to accept this obligation that forces the Government to take the steps I have outlined in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bill will insert the text of these agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act. The Bill also proposes certain minor technical amendments to the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act (No.2) 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements with China, Sri Lanka and Fiji were signed on 17 November 1988, 18 December 1989 and 15 October 1990 respectively. Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements included in this Bill will allocate taxing rights over all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and the respective agreement countries. However, the existing Airlines Profits Agreement with China will continue to allocate taxing rights between the two countries in respect of international air transport operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements substantially accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years. The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and these three countries and that it is appropriate to pursue these aims at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> A feature of the agreements is that they each provide for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by China, Sri Lanka and Fiji under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. This means that where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, each agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed by Australia as if the foreign tax forgone had been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> By this means, the development incentives will retain their attraction for Australian investors and allow them to compete on favourable terms with investors from other countries, as they will not be negated by the imposition of Australian tax. I note here that the agreements were negotiated on the basis of the existing income tax laws of the respective countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard, the Government has proposed changes to Australia's general foreign tax credit system which will affect the practical operation of the tax credit provisions of these agreements and of earlier concluded agreements, including their tax sparing mechanisms. These changes are included in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990, which is currently before the Parliament and was recently passed by this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes will apply from the beginning of the 1990-91 income year and provide for certain dividend payments and branch profits derived by Australian resident companies from comparable tax countries to be exempt from Australian tax. As these three countries are each broadly considered to be a comparable tax country, those proposed exemptions will provide at least as great relief from Australian tax and would operate in relation to such income from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the agreements will enter into force when diplomatic notes are exchanged notifying the other country that all necessary constitutional processes have been completed to give the agreement the force of law. That notification can be given for each agreement, in the case of Australia, following the enactment of this Bill. The agreements will help facilitate trading and investment relationships with the other countries but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It will give effect to announcements in the 1989 Budget and in June this year to increase the level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions made by people who do not receive superannuation support from anyone else, and will introduce a new tax rebate for certain taxpayers with only small amounts of superannuation support from another person. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will exempt from tax the pay and allowances of Defence Force personnel on operational service in response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Amendments to the gift provisions of the income tax law, and in relation to the taxation of eligible termination payments and capital gains are also proposed. It will also provide for a new penalty where a taxpayer overestimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages in a provisional tax variation application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will exempt from fringe benefits tax payments made by employers to commercial child care centres to secure priority of access for children of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill will modify the operation of a number of taxation laws in accordance with the policy of the Sex Discrimination Act, and make amendments to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 in respect of tax file numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased Deductions for Personal Superannuation Contributions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will give effect to the Government's 1989 Budget commitment to increase the level of tax deductions for personal superannuation contributions made by self-employed people and those employees who do not receive superannuation support from anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum deduction for superannuation contributions made by self-employed people and unsupported employees is presently $3,000. This Bill will significantly increase this limit so that it is the lesser of: $3,000, plus 75 per cent of any contributions exceeding $3,000; and the amount of contributions required to provide the person with a benefit equal to the person's reasonable benefit limit. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure, taken together with the proposed new tax rebate for employees with low levels of superannuation support-which I will deal with in a moment-will further encourage people to self-provide for retirement. The new measures complement this Government's significant reforms in recent years that have been designed to make superannuation attractive as a savings vehicle, economically sustainable and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> Taken together they give real meaning to the Government's retirement incomes policy, of ensuring that all Australians have an adequate and secure income in retirement and that those in the work force are encouraged to save for their retirement in order to enjoy a higher standard of living and be less dependent on the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>New Tax Rebate for Certain Personal Superannuation Contributions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also introduce a new tax rebate that is to be available to certain people who are not entitled to tax deductions for their superannuation contributions because superannuation support is provided by someone else-usually the employer-other than solely through a 3 per cent award superannuation agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The target group for this rebate is made up of people earning low to middle incomes who receive only a small amount of the type of superannuation support that disqualifies them for a deduction. The rebate will act as an important incentive for these people to make superannuation savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will be available to people who, broadly, do not get more than $1,600 of superannuation support in a year from someone else. The base rebate is to be 25 per cent of the person's own superannuation contributions in a year of income, up to a maximum of $3,000 contributions, and will be available to people whose assessable income does not exceed $25,000. The maximum contributions for which the rebate applies will be reduced by 50c for each dollar of assessable income over $25,000, so that the rebate cuts out altogether when a person's assessable income is $31,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the new rebate is not abused, part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act-the general anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law-is to be extended to cover schemes entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a rebate for superannuation contributions. This amendment is to apply to schemes entered into after today. The cost to revenue of the increased superannuation deductions and the new rebate is estimated to be $145m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption of Pay and Allowances of Members of Defence Force on Operational Service</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As announced by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) on 14 August 1990, this Bill will exempt from income tax the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel while on operational service in the Middle East in response to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. The exemption will apply to Australian Defence Force personnel serving in the operational area, including personnel attached to the Armed Forces of the United States and the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will apply to pay and allowances derived on and after 2 August 1990-the date of the invasion-and is expected to have a revenue cost of $850,000 per month with a total cost of $8.75m in the financial year 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will modify the capital gains tax rules in two respects. It will allow roll-over relief where an original asset is destroyed as the result of a natural disaster, and give effect to the 1990 Budget announcement to extend the principal residence exemption during a taxpayer's temporary absence. Presently, to obtain roll-over relief following the involuntary disposal of a pre-20 September 1985 asset, the amount paid for a replacement asset must not exceed 120 per cent of the market value of the original asset at the time it was destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Newcastle earthquake, escalating building costs resulted in some difficulties for taxpayers in replacing destroyed assets within the terms of this limitation. The Bill will remove the 120 per cent limitation where assets are lost or destroyed as the result of a natural disaster, but alternatively require that the replacement asset be substantially the same as the original. </PARA>
<PARA> As also announced in the last Budget, taxpayers will now be permitted to retain the tax exempt status of their sole or principal residence for unlimited periods of absence, instead of the present four year maximum, provided the dwelling is not used to produce income. For periods of income-producing use during a taxpayer's absence, an exemption of up to six years will be available. If, after six years of such income-producing use, the taxpayer continues to be absent and derives income from the dwelling, the exemption will be lost, but only in respect of the period exceeding six years. It will also no longer be necessary for the taxpayer to reoccupy the dwelling prior to its disposal to be eligible for the exemption during an absence. These more generous arrangements will apply from the commencement of the capital gains tax, 19 September 1985. These changes will result in a small but unquantifiable cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Eligible Termination Payments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A number of minor amendments in the existing law relating to the excessive component of an eligible termination payment will be effected by this Bill. An excessive component arises where superannuation benefits received by a taxpayer are in excess of the taxpayer's reasonable benefit limit. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the excessive component of an eligible termination payment which arises on commutation of the excessive amount of a pension or annuity can be rolled over, but is still subject to tax at the time of receipt. To correct this anomaly the Government has decided to prevent the roll-over of such an eligible termination payment. This will prevent administrative and compliance costs which may arise due to the recalculation of the components of an eligible termination payment if the excessive component were able to be rolled over and not subject to tax at that time. Further, a taxpayer will not be able to reduce the amount of such an eligible termination payment by any unused undeducted purchase price of the pension or annuity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also remove the provisions in the law that reduce the excessive component of an eligible termination payment by any non-qualifying component. These amendments, which apply to payments made on or after 1 July 1990, are expected to have a negligible effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional Tax Penalty</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed in the 1990 Budget, this Bill provides for a new penalty where a taxpayer overestimates the amount of tax instalment deductions from salary or wages income in an application to vary provisional tax. This new penalty will apply only where the existing provisional tax penalties do not apply to the taxpayer and, in the preceding year, the tax owed on assessment was $3,000 or more and tax instalments were underdeducted by a similar amount. This measure has negligible revenue effects. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Treasurer's announcement of 20 September 1990, gifts of the value of $2 or more made on or after that date to The Friends of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in Australia Incorporated will be an allowable deduction. The cost to revenue of the amendment is expected to be $100,000 in a full financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to extend by six months-to 31 December 1990-the period of deductibility for gifts to Australian Vietnam Forces Welcome Home `87 Pty Limited for the purpose of the Australian Vietnam forces national memorial project. The revenue cost of this proposal is estimated at $75,000 in 1991-92 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, employers who secure priority of access in child-care centres for children of employees, by making payments under the children's services program, are exempt from fringe benefits tax on the benefit provided. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will extend this exemption to payments made to a commercial child-care centre that is an eligible child-care centre for the purposes of the Child Care Act 1972. The payment must also be made under the services for families with children program operated by the Department of Community Services and Health which has replaced the children's services program. The proposal is expected to be revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will make a technical amendment to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 concerning the quotation of tax file numbers to payers of superannuation and termination of employment benefits. That Act currently provides that a person may quote his or her tax file number to the payer of a benefit subject to the reasonable benefit limits for forwarding onto the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. Quotations may only occur, however, once the payment has been made, and this is not consistent with the timing for quoting a tax file number on an Australian Taxation Office form. Therefore, this Bill proposes a technical amendment of the Act to bring Insurance and Superannuation Commission procedures into line with those of the Tax Office, and allow a person to quote his or her tax file number to a payer at the time the person becomes entitled to receive payment of the benefit. This will ease the administrative burden on payers of superannuation and termination of employment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted in determining the timing of quotation of tax file numbers and has no objections to these new arrangements. In this regard, the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is required to comply with the guidelines for the collection, storage and use of tax file numbers and the information privacy principles prescribed under the Privacy Act 1988. The amendment will have no revenue impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments Relating to Sex Discrimination</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend certain laws administered by the Commissioner of Taxation so that they will comply, as far as possible, with the policy of the Sex Discrimination Act. That Act declares discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy to be unlawful in a number of areas of community life. Up until now the taxation laws have been exempted from the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, however, committed to reducing the number of exemptions in that Act and the amendments made by this Bill will limit the scope of the exemptions for the taxation laws. This is a result of the ongoing review process which is part of the Government's National Agenda for Women. </PARA>
<PARA> To remove discrimination between a legally married spouse and a de facto spouse where the de facto spouse would otherwise be treated as single, the Bill will insert a new definition of `spouse' in the Income Tax Assessment Act to apply generally throughout that Act. While many areas of the income tax law already apply as if the term `spouse' includes a de facto spouse, the new definition has necessitated several consequential adjustments to that law and to those relating to the Medicare levy and the taxation of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also remedy certain other discriminatory features in the income tax law. For example, the marital status qualifications that apply to the special provisions which apply to the income of revocable trusts and certain unearned income of children will be removed. At the same time the opportunity is being taken to reduce the age limit below which certain provisions apply from 21 years to 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the daughter-housekeeper rebate that is currently available to a widowed taxpayer whose daughter is wholly engaged in keeping house for the taxpayer will be replaced by a child-housekeeper rebate. This rebate will be available to all taxpayers who have a child wholly engaged in keeping house for them. The estimated cost to revenue of these proposed amendments is less than $500,000 in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to implement the amendments to the export market development grants scheme (EMDGS) announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) on 28 February 1990. In accordance with that announcement, these amendments will be made retrospective to 1 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The EMDGS was set up nearly 20 years ago to support the efforts of Australia's small to medium sized companies in entering and developing export markets. The scheme provides financial incentives in the form of taxable cash grants for eligible expenditure incurred on overseas market research and development. Honourable members will be well aware that the Government is concerned to ensure that public funds in all areas are used in a cost-effective manner. Further, as regards export incentives, the Government is committed to ensuring that the expenditure of such public funds results in an improvement in sustained export performance. It is mindful that the EMDG scheme is an incentive scheme to encourage Australian exporters to seek out and develop overseas markets and not a subsidy for industry. </PARA>
<PARA> With this background and a scheduled termination date for the EMDG scheme of 30 June 1990, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce decided to initiate a comprehensive review of the EMDG and related schemes. The purpose of this review was to assess the scheme's effectiveness against its original objectives and the Government's aim to encourage a more outward looking and internationally competitive Australian industry which can contribute to improving Australia's balance of payments position. </PARA>
<PARA> To undertake this review, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce appointed a committee in December 1988, chaired by Professor Helen Hughes, the Committee for Review of Export Market Development Assistance. The Committee also included Mr John Carden, Executive Director of CRA Ltd; Mr Andrew Gisham, Director of Vision Systems Ltd; and Mr Bill Mansfield, Assistant Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Committee Secretariat was provided by officers of the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Australian Trade Commission, Austrade. The Hughes Committee presented its report to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce in July 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates the work undertaken by the Committee in comprehensively analysing the current system of government support for exporters and its strengths and weaknesses. The Committee also addressed, in a constructive way, wider issues, including the economic environment and the pace of reform. I take this opportunity to thank Professor Hughes and the other members of the Committee for their thorough report. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, therefore, two distinct but interdependent themes to the Committee's report. The first addresses export incentives, in particular the EMDGS and the new discretionary international trade enhancement scheme (ITES). The second theme addresses the wider economic policy environment and overall trade competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended the extension of a modified open access export grants scheme for a further five years and the introduction of a selective incentive scheme for firms or industry groups that have overcome the initial difficulties of exporting and are ready for a major export effort. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that this Bill introduces legislation to continue the export market development grants scheme for a further five years to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now outline the major changes that are being introduced in this Bill. In February this year the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce jointly released the Government's decision on the Hughes Committee report. The Government agreed with the Committee on most of its proposed refinements to the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, exporters will graduate from the scheme after receiving eight incentive payments; the grant rate will be reduced from 70 to 50 per cent of the eligible expenditure; the maximum grant payment will increase from $200,000 to $250,000 with an export ceiling of $25m; and there will be a new minimum expenditure threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> The expenditure threshold, however, has been raised only from $10,000 to $30,000, with expenditure after the first $15,000 being eligible for reimbursement, as opposed to the $50,000 threshold recommended by the Review Committee. Such a large increase would have excluded too many promising smaller exporters. The effect of some of these changes to the scheme would be to deny access to a number of smaller exporters and also to those exporters who have used the scheme for more than eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning first to smaller exporters, the Government appreciated that, in some cases, further support will be necessary. Accordingly, the Government has proposed changes to the EMDGS that are designed to benefit those small and medium sized firms that are endeavouring to develop and expand export markets but lack the critical mass to be truly competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The EMDGS has been specifically structured to encourage smaller firms to collaborate more either among themselves or with larger firms. Joint ventures and consortia will be able to claim grants in their own right, provided they meet certain criteria, and will not inherit any previous claims history of their individual members. In addition, a new category of claimants-approved trading bodies-has been created to encourage trading houses to export the products of smaller Australian firms which, whilst they have competitive products, do not have the resources and/or know-how to successfully export. Small exporters will therefore have a better chance of government support where they are prepared to work with other firms. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the firms excluded by the eight-year cutoff, the Government's decision to limit claims to eight was based on the well documented evidence that EMDG recipients' efforts to develop new markets reach a plateau after eight years and that only a few firms continued to open new markets after the eight-year cut-off. Furthermore, the majority of the firms excluded are large firms with considerable expertise in exporting. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases, however, the Government appreciates that additional support may be required for those eight-year exporters who are proposing to enter completely new markets or launch entirely new products. Partly with this in mind, the Government agreed with the Hughes Committee's recommendation to establish a new discretionary scheme-the international trade enhancement scheme (ITES). I say `partly' because we anticipate the four-year scheme having a far broader impact. </PARA>
<PARA> For a start, the ITES will replace to some extent the international business development scheme and the high technology exporters scheme. In addition, it will support new and more innovative approaches by Australian exporters. The Government is particularly interested in seeing the scheme used to encourage collaboration by smaller companies through consortia and industry associations. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from some streamlining, a broadening of the definition of eligible services to include inbound tourist operators and legal and health services, and giving access to trading houses, joint ventures and consortiums of small companies, the administrative guidelines of the EMDGS will not substantially change from those that now apply. The scheme is estimated to cost $134m but, given the one-year delay in payments, the first budget year for the scheme will be 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> In the February announcement, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce foreshadowed that amendments to the EMDG Act arising out of the Government's adoption of the Hughes Committee's recommendations would operate from 1 July 1990. The need to consult widely with interested bodies about the precise nature of the new provisions required in a revised EMDG Act to give effect to the Government's decision precluded the required substantive amendments to the EMDG Act being brought forward in the last parliamentary sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wanted to ensure that all possible views were taken into account so that the best possible framework, within the limits of the Government's decision, was implemented in respect of the revised scheme. Accordingly, the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Act 1990 was passed during the autumn sittings as an interim measure to preserve the continuity of the EMDG Act from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the announcement of February and to limit any confusion for EMDGS recipients, amendments to the EMDG Act will be made retrospective to 1 July 1990. Exporters have been fully apprised of the Government's intention to make such amendments retrospective. To do otherwise at this stage would create needless confusion and uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the other side of the Hughes Committee's equation-economic reform-much of what the Committee has recommended is consistent with the reform agenda of the Government. At the same time, it is always of value to have additional and informed comment on reform priorities and how these should be addressed in both macro-economic and micro-economic areas. The Committee's proposals are being considered in this broader picture. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year, two other major reports have examined aspects of Australia's competitiveness and export future-the Garnaut report `Australia and the Northeast Asian Ascendancy' and the study of `Australian Manufacturing in the 1990s' for the Australian Manufacturing Council. While the differences between the reports-Hughes, Garnaut and the AMC-remain important, the three reports embody a large agreed agenda for reform, including an issue which goes to the core of the whole export question. It is one which this Government regards as critical to the trade related area. We have not in this country, at least not in the manufacturing and services sector, developed a true export culture. The Hughes Committee and the AMC report found that in the wider community and business alike there is a poor grasp of the drive, commitment and risk involved in succeeding on world markets; in being world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to take what action it can to inculcate such a culture. For the present, the revised EMDGS and the new international trade enhancement scheme will contribute to this process. Education in export management has been given specific encouragement under the EMDGS, as have industry associations under the ITES, while smaller exporters, as I have already highlighted, will now have a better chance of Government support where they are prepared to work with other firms. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government appreciates that these measures will not change our national attitude to exporting overnight. The Government can do more and it will be looking for new ways to pursue this important objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1990 will provide legislative authority for the implementation of the Government's decision to sell the business of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC) and for certain staffing arrangements associated with the sale. It will also provide for the abolition of the HLIC on a date to be proclaimed after the sale is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed sale of the HLIC business was included amongst a number of major asset sales announced in the 1989-90 Budget. The Minister for Finance indicated on 30 October 1990 that the CIC Insurance Group has been identified as the preferred purchaser of elements of the HLIC business-and also as the proposed agent of the Commonwealth in carrying out the services required to be performed as a result of the consequential abolition of the HLIC. Negotiations are currently under way with the CIC Insurance Group to finalise the detailed contract for that agency arrangement and to complete the sale of the HLIC business by 31 December 1990, if possible. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated at the time the sale was announced, housing loan insurance is now widely available in Australia on a commercial basis. In these circumstances, there is insufficient justification for retaining the HLIC in public ownership. Essentially, the Government has better uses for the assets which the Commonwealth now has invested in the HLIC, particularly at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The HLIC was established in the public sector 25 years ago to meet a structural deficiency which existed in the highly regulated finance environment of that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance from institutions which tended to allocate their then scarce housing funds on a least risk basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the establishment of the HLIC, a competitive private sector mortgage insurance industry has developed in Australia. Together with the finance industry reforms introduced by this Government, this has removed the old structural deficiency in the housing finance market. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms already agreed with the preferred purchaser, the CIC Insurance Group will continue the present mortgage insurance operations of the HLIC in a separately managed subsidiary, and will also act as agent for the Commonwealth in administering, under contract, the insurance obligations entered into by the HLIC before the sale comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The CIC Insurance Group is Australia's fifth largest private general insurer. It is jointly owned by the Norwich Insurance Group of the United Kingdom and the Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company, with a minority equity holding by the Chiyoda Insurance Company of Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> In its future mortgage insurance operations, the CIC Insurance Group will be required to satisfy the prudential and other requirements applied under the Insurance Act 1973 to all private mortgage insurers by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC). With its strong international backing, the CIC Insurance Group is expected to provide effective competition to the other existing private mortgage insurers, thereby helping to ensure that premiums are kept low. The maintenance in this industry of competition between firms operating on an equal footing has been an important objective of the Government throughout this sale. I am satisfied that the proposed sale arrangements will achieve that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill explicitly continues for an indefinite period the Commonwealth guarantee on all insurance policies entered into by the HLIC prior to its abolition. Under the proposed sale arrangements, the CIC Insurance Group will acquire the goodwill and physical assets of the HLIC and, having obtained a mortgage insurance licence from the ISC, will write new mortgage insurance policies on its own account in future. The HLIC itself will be abolished after the sale is completed and its remaining assets and liabilities will then revert to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will contract with the CIC Insurance Group to manage, as its agent, the administration of the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations entered into by the HLIC prior to its abolition. Moneys will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account established by the CIC Insurance Group, and replenished as and when necessary, to meet claims against the pre-sale insurance obligations of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA> To help it continue the business, the CIC Insurance Group will employ the bulk of the present HLIC management and staff on terms which, overall, are comparable to those they now enjoy. The HLIC has a staff of over 50. Equitable treatment of the present HLIC employees and their continued welfare has been a major consideration for the Government in developing the staffing arrangements associated with the sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The great majority of the present HLIC staff and management will be able to continue their careers in mortgage insurance on terms as good as or better than at present. Those few to whom the CIC Insurance Group decides not to offer equivalent employment will be made redundant by the HLIC prior to the sale completion date and will receive all of the award and other entitlements due to them in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Since those who accept equivalent employment with the CIC Insurance Group would otherwise lose some accumulated entitlements, the Commonwealth will contract with the CIC Insurance Group for the reinstatement of certain redundancy benefits and sick leave credits. HLIC employees transferring to the CIC Insurance Group will also have additional superannuation benefit options over and above those normally provided on resignation. Those benefits are being made available by regulation under the authority of the new, recently enacted section 155b of the Superannuation Act 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> In cases like this, where there is, in practice, an opportunity for continuity of employment when a Commonwealth business is sold into the private sector, it would be inappropriate for the Government to make all employees eligible for large redundancy payments and the associated lump sum superannuation benefits. Accordingly, the Bill deems to have resigned those HLIC employees who reject an offer of equivalent employment from the CIC Insurance Group. A similar provision was included in the legislation enacted to implement the staffing arrangements, developed in conjunction with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, for the sale of the Williamstown Naval Dockyard in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the HLIC to be abolished on a date to be proclaimed after the sale is completed. As part of these arrangements, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of sale will be prepared by the HLIC. After being audited by the Auditor-General's Office, they will be tabled in the Parliament in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the arrangements provided for in the Bill, all of the residual assets and liabilities of the HLIC will be transferred to the Commonwealth. These include both the outstanding insurance obligations of the HLIC and the investments underlying the provisions made by the HLIC to meet those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall return to the Commonwealth from the sale and the associated abolition of the HLIC is estimated to be around $80m in net present value terms after allowing for the costs to be incurred in future in administering the continuing presale obligations of the HLIC. More than $100m is expected to be credited to Consolidated Revenue in the current financial year. The bulk of the return to Consolidated Revenue will come from the realisation of the investments held by the HLIC to underpin its provisions for future claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent actuarial analysis suggests that these provisions by the HLIC are significantly in excess of the level required to meet claims that can be expected to arise in normal circumstances. The final outcome will, of course, depend on the actual level of claims made against the HLIC's existing insurance obligations. To a large extent, this will be determined by the state of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Any consideration of the downside risk associated with the run-down of the insurance policies in place prior to the HLIC's abolition needs to recognise that the Commonwealth is already exposed to that risk because of its statutory guarantee of the operations of the HLIC. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out to the House that the sale of the HLIC business is not the fire sale of a failed operation, unlike some of the private sector asset sales we have seen recently. Rather, it is the natural culmination of a successful public sector initiative which has met its original objective and, by so doing, has made it unnecessary for the Government to continue to be directly involved in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As Minister for Transport and Communications, I am pleased to present to the House the Aussat Amendment Bill 1990. The fundamental part played by telecommunications in the Government's micro-economic reform agenda is now a matter of public record. The continued pursuit of that agenda across a wide range of sectors has been and will remain one of the Government's prime economic concerns. In May 1988, the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, took the first steps towards reforming and restructuring the Australian telecommunications system. The May 1988 reforms foresaw the need for a review of the existing carrier arrangements with a view towards promoting efficiency in the telecommunications market, providing universal access to telecommunications services, and bringing foreign investment into this country through an effective and cost efficient telecommunications service. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time major restructuring of the industry has been under way. My predecessors, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), implemented changes through a new Telecommunications Act 1989 which enabled competition in value added services and customer equipment and which provided for an independent regulator, Austel. Complementary reforms to enhance the commercial orientation and accountability of the telecommunications government business enterprises were also made. </PARA>
<PARA> The first step in the next stage of the Government's reform process is being taken with these amendments. The telecommunications reform package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will promote competition and dynamism in the industry, guarantee community service obligations in telecommunications, maintain quality of telecommunications services, maintain Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd in full public ownership, maintain maximum possible Australian ownership in the industry, further develop and promote the industry, ensure effective regulation and remove from Telecom and OTC all government imposed constraints which limit their ability to respond effectively to competition and which do not serve the broader national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation is being prepared to implement the Government's reforms. As an essential interim measure, I present to the House the Aussat Amendment Bill which seeks to give the Government the capacity to sell Aussat and put in place temporary measures to allow Aussat to compete in the short term with OTC and Telecom. The Bill does not, however, seek to establish the duopoly on network provision which is to apply until 1997 as foreshadowed by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I will introduce legislation related to these reforms in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Aussat Act 1984 will facilitate the sale of Aussat in accordance with the Government's announced policy by repealing those parts of the Aussat Act 1984 which prohibit its conversion to a public company and which limit its number of shareholders. The proposed amendments will also serve to allow Aussat to compete with OTC and Telecom across the full range of services in the international and domestic markets. They provide an interim measure to facilitate Aussat's entry into the market pending revision of the present Telecommunications Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Aussat will, under this Bill, have the primary object of providing telecommunications services within and outside Australia. Previously, Aussat was restrained by its charter to providing telecommunications systems for Australia and neighbouring regions by the use of space satellites. It will now be able to utilise both terrestrial and satellite facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is also made for Aussat to have genuine access to the reserved services market by giving Austel the power to direct another carrier to make available telecommunications networks and facilities, should they be required by Aussat. Austel will also have the power to set the terms and conditions of the access in the event that the providing carrier and Aussat are unable to agree on them. Austel's powers will also ensure that the supplying carrier receives reasonable remuneration, either through negotiation directly with Aussat or, failing satisfactory negotiations, by determination by Austel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that Aussat's ability to provide new services will improve its commercial viability and that substantial Commonwealth revenue will be generated by its sale. The price obtained for the sale of Aussat will depend on responses by tenderers in negotiation later this year. The extent to which Aussat's commercial viability is enhanced from new services is not readily assessable because the Aussat board will need to take its own decisions on how it will react to the new business opportunities offered. I will expect, nevertheless, that the Aussat board will consult closely with me on any new business ventures it proposes to undertake in order to ensure that Aussat does not pre-empt any plans which a potential purchaser may have. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments will not affect the basic telephone service or the first telephone service currently provided by Telecom. Nor will they have any effect on community service obligations provided through services such as outback lines for rural and remote communities. The requirement will continue to be on Telecom to provide these services. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the importance of this Bill lies in its removal of the constraints on the sale of Aussat and its provision for Aussat to be able to compete, both of which are necessary to facilitate the emergence of a second carrier. Aussat can begin the process of entry into the market, and the way is laid clear for tenders to be sought from prospective purchasers. The Bill is an essential part of the Government's announced package of reforms for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to continue this Government's outstanding record on telecommunications reform, knowing that with these reforms our telecommunications industry can grow in strength and at the same time services can become more efficient and cost effective. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 is to provide a legislative basis to regulate the marketing and provision of education services to the overseas market through the registration of institutions and courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The export of education services by Australian institutions, particularly for full fee paying formal and non-formal courses, has expanded considerably during the past three years. Large numbers of new organisations have become involved in the provision of courses for overseas students. Some of these have failed leaving students stranded; a few have been downright dishonest bringing Australia's reputation into disrepute with the result that formal regulation has become necessary to protect the interests of both students and providers. </PARA>
<PARA> State and Territory governments are well aware of the problems that have arisen, particularly in the non-formal course area, and are fully behind the Government's moves to bring stability to ensure standards for the education exports industry. Support has also been received from the industry itself. This is well illustrated in the ready cooperation that we have received from both the States and the industry in the lead up to the formation of a national consultative body to provide a forum for discussion and information exchange on education export policy issues and to ensure coordination in the promotion of Australia's education and training services. Consultations are continuing with the various interested parties on its proposed composition and terms of reference and an announcement on the body's formation and operations can be expected shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> A formal register of institutions and courses known as the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students will be established under this legislation. Students will only be granted a visa for travel to Australia for study purposes if they are accepted for registered courses in registered institutions. Besides having to be approved as a provider of courses for overseas students by the relevant State authority, institutions have to have satisfactory fiduciary arrangements for the advance payments made by intending students through specially established trust funds, the operation and maintenance of which are prescribed in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> A penalty of up to $10,000 may be imposed on any institution, body or person that undertakes or attempts to market education services for overseas students without registration under this legislation. A number of obligations and conditions need to be met to maintain a position on the register. Penalties are also provided for non-compliance with those relating to financial arrangements, insurance to protect moneys in the trust funds and the supply of returns and other information relating to recruitment, enrolment and provision of courses. They are not unnecessarily burdensome as similar returns are required of institutions as a result of membership of the peak industry groups such as ACPET and the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students association. </PARA>
<PARA> Providers and their courses may be suspended or their registration cancelled under certain circumstances as laid down in the Bill. Such action, when taken by the Minister, is subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The regulation of and accountability for actions of some of the newer institutions have been a cause of concern for some time. While the duties of directors of companies are prescribed under the companies codes in each State and the behaviour of agents acting on behalf of institutions is addressed extensively by existing agency law, regulations may be made under this legislation to establish guidelines for the actions of directors and agents of institutions in marketing and recruiting both in Australia and overseas and in providing courses and support for their students. </PARA>
<PARA> While this Bill has no direct financial impact since it does not raise revenue or appropriate funds for expenditure, it will have an impact in that it will save potential administrative and legal costs of government action similar to that which has occurred over the past twelve months and has led to the introduction of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990, currently before the Parliament, should this industry continue to be unregulated. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will ensure that Australia's reputation in the education export market is upheld and that overseas students may be sure of the quality and integrity of the courses being offered to them. Further, it will protect the future of a valuable growing export industry. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill was adjourned last night, I was saying that it was in the area of Commonwealth-State financial relations, as highlighted in this legislation, that I wished to address my remarks. The Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane last week heralded a new era of cooperation between the Federal and State governments. A major reform of Federal-State relations is long overdue. One of the precursors of this issue, Russell Mathews, who in 1986 retired as foundation Director of the Centre for Research on Federal Financial Relations at the Australian National University, presented a fascinating paper entitled The Commonwealth-State Financial Contract for the Australian Institute of Political Science at the summer school held in Canberra on 31 January 1982. In his paper he portrayed a sorry story of the Fraser Government years and the sad efforts-if efforts is what they can be called-of the Liberal-National Government towards improving Commonwealth-State financial relations. The fact is that a special Premiers Conference where leaders and representatives agreed on the need for a fundamental review of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements would have been unthinkable under the previous Liberal-National Government. Of the Fraser Government years, Mr Mathews said in his paper:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Far from exercising the coordinating role for which it is best fitted, the Commonwealth has either interfered unnecessarily in programs that the States can handle effectively themselves or left it to individual State Governments to establish whatever administrative machinery they consider appropriate, even when national or extra State interests are involved. The result has been either wasteful duplication of activities across the States or a complete policy vacuum--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should listen to this. He would learn something and then he would be able to make an effective contribution to the debate. Mr Mathews continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . with the consequence that effective co-ordination is virtually non-existent in major fields of public policy such as economic development, transport, Aboriginal affairs, environmental policy and law reform. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In its roads grants arrangements, the Commonwealth has consistently shown itself to be more concerned with earmarking funds for local roads than with developing a national road system. </PARA>
<PARA>Never was this more evident than in the appalling condition of the Bruce Highway in north Queensland. The Fraser Government years saw a period of almost total neglect of the national highway in north Queensland. The Bruce Highway was regarded by locals and anyone else who was hardy enough to venture forth as being little better than a goat track. The Hawke Government changed all that and, although the job is far from finished, since 1983 the Bruce Highway has at last begun to take on a respectable appearance. It is certainly no longer seen as a major obstacle to intrepid travellers travelling north. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of inadequate road funding was not the only complaint against the Fraser Government's poor performance in Commonwealth-State relations. Russell Mathews had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's intrusion into the financing of education and health services, which has by contrast been very significant indeed, has been marked by capricious decisions which have hindered rather than facilitated the achievement of national uniformity in standards of service provision. In the case of school grants, those States which have been spending least on education in per capita terms thus tended to receive the largest Commonwealth grants, whereas in the case of hospital cost sharing grants those States which had been spending most on their hospitals received the largest grants. </PARA>
<PARA> But the Commonwealth's continuing constraints on public sector capital spending represent the most serious misuse of its fiscal powers, resulting not only in an inefficient allocation of resources but also in unnecessary unemployment and continuing curbs on economic development. Except for a few years during the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the public sector capital stock has suffered decades of neglect. This is not because there is less social and economic justification for public investment than for recurrent spending or private investment, but simply because it is the form of expenditure which can be most easily deferred by Commonwealth action. </PARA>
<PARA>Could the Australian people expect anything better from a Hewson-led Liberal-National government? The answer is no. The Liberals claim to be formulating a federalism policy, but they have made few statements on federalism and the acceleration of micro-economic reform. This is despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his first statement as Leader, predicted that Commonwealth-State relations was the issue of the 1990s. It is not surprising. The Liberal and National parties have not changed. There is no reason to believe that the States could expect any more joy from a Hewson-Fischer government than they experienced during the Fraser years. It would be a case of history repeating itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Fraser Government announced its new federalism program. It was to be based on cooperation, not conflict; and partnership, not domination. The basis of the approach was to be a tax sharing system, whereby the Commonwealth general revenue grants to the States would be a proportion of designated Federal tax receipts-initially, a share of personal income tax receipts and, later, a share of total tax revenues. The Liberal-National parties also pledged to allow the States to have partial access to the income tax base by allowing them to impose income tax surcharges or rebates. The proportion of grants given to the States was to be reduced and the States were to be consulted on issues of relevance to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the rhetoric, the Fraser Government did not adhere to these principles. As far as consultation was concerned, the Fraser Government did not consult with the States on issues of relevance to them. I will give some examples: changes to the income tax structure; the spasmodic introduction and withdrawal of personal income tax indexation; changes in health insurance arrangements-the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) would remember that well-the termination of a number of specific purpose programs; and the decision to transfer full financial responsibility for them to the States as a result of the finding of the review of Commonwealth functions by the so-called Lynch razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the consequences of these successive failures by the former Liberal-National Government was the deterioration of Australia's national infrastructure. The provision of national infrastructure is very much a responsibility of Commonwealth-State financial relations. Indeed, this Bill provides for nearly $300m in grants to the States in respect of capital expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Bill also provides that no conditions are imposed on the States as to expenditure of capital grants and that the States are not necessarily required to spend the money on capital projects. The States have a free rein to do what they will with this money. Nevertheless, in my view, more money should be spent on capital projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's economic building blocks are based on the level of government expenditure on national infrastructure. If Australia is to recover its economic prosperity and if governments are to discharge their social objectives, neither Federal nor State governments can ignore the urgent requirement for increased expenditure on national infrastructure. The Australian Federation of Construction Contractors has rightly observed the following:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a nation which reduces its spending on infrastructure has stopped investing in its future. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true to say that, during this time of economic recession, there is widespread community concern over the apparent decrease in the level of spending on national infrastructure, for example, transport, communications, airports, water supply and ports. From my experience, I believe that this public concern is growing. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much debate on the adequacy and efficiency of Australia's economic infrastructure. The Economic Planning Advisory Council has published a paper on this issue and a sub-committee of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), released a report on national infrastructure in December 1987. Many more papers have been written on the subject, and a number of forums and seminars have been held on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain that, without purposeful government-led public funding on national infrastructure projects, it would have been impossible to develop the wide diversity of industry and commerce which exists across Australia. I have long held the view that public infrastructure should be several steps ahead of private investment. This was the way that northern Australia was developed. Fortunately, governments at the turn of the century had few so-called economic rationalists deciding the order of priority on public spending. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that in north Queensland, for example, the discovery of gold and extensive grazing lands initially attracted private development, but it was only when transport and communications facilities were established by the government of the day that the mining and grazing industries secured a permanent economic base. It was the establishment of ports, railways, roads and telecommunications that attracted thousands of permanent settlers to these remote regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> More than any other public utility, railways made the greatest contribution to the continued development of north Queensland, particularly in so far as it relates to the sugar industry. The Australian Labor Party has a proud record of developing public infrastructure, which, whilst not economic at the time of its establishment, has proved to be of incalculable economic benefit to the people of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House just two examples: every hydroelectric scheme in north Queensland was developed by a Labor government. The greatest water storage and irrigation project on the east coast of Australia was developed and constructed by the Federal Labor Government. This project alone, the Burdekin Dam scheme, will enable the development of secondary industry and extensive agricultural production and will earn Australia billions of dollars annually in export income. Economic rationalists said at the time, and indeed some still say, that the project could not be justified. How wrong they are and doubly wrong they shall be proven to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government pledged to get consultative mechanisms into place between the Commonwealth, the States and local government. The Advisory Council for Inter-Governmental Relations-which it did establish-never lived up to its promise and was abolished by the Hawke Government. The Hawke Government has involved local government in the decision making process more than the Fraser Government ever did. Local government was asked to participate in the Special Premiers Conference and local government will derive much benefit from greater harmony of relations in the Federal system. The Canberra Times of 25 October 1990 reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The NSW Premier, Nick Greiner, has backed the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, on the `absurdity' of barriers between the States and taken a swipe at outgoing Liberal President John Elliott. In a major speech to his party yesterday, Mr Greiner called for the Liberals to drop their obsession with defending States' rights. </PARA>
<PARA> He urged the Party to support the creation of a new, practical Federalism and to adopt policies that reflected the real concerns of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> He was not arguing for centralism, but for commonsense and rationality and rebuked colleagues who had dismissed next week's special Premiers' Conference as `a sham'. </PARA>
<PARA> He agreed with Mr Hawke that Australia must move to a `single market, a single economy and indeed, a single nation' . . . `too often we (the Liberal Party) give the impression to the world that we are obsessed with States' rights for their own sake, and we don't pay enough attention to people's rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Greiner has good reason to be concerned about the attitude of his Federal counterparts in the area of Commonwealth-State relations. The Liberal Party may be obsessed with defending States rights, but it also appears-in the area of social security and welfare-intent on forcing a burden on the States and local government that neither the States nor local government would want. </PARA>
<PARA> Take social security. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hewson), on ABC radio on 17 October, in reply to a question over a report in the Melbourne Sun-Herald on 11 October which indicated he was in favour of Liberal Party proposals to abolish the Department of Social Security, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that we do not need a Federal Department. </PARA>
<PARA>This outrageous stance of the Opposition was echoed by the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Jim Short, in an attachment to a media release on Commonwealth-State relations, issued on 29 October, which said in reference to social security and welfare services:</PARA>
<PARA> The States and local government should have the primary responsibility for the delivery of specific services.</PARA>

Not only would about 132,000 northern zone clients on the full range of pensions, family allowance and benefits have their payments placed at grave risk, but also 500 employees of the Department covering the whole of the northern zone would find their jobs placed in jeopardy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal Party, with the Leader of the Opposition at the helm, is again demonstrating a gross lack of knowledge and understanding of the social security system by wanting to turn back the clock to the bad old days, when nobody but people with money were of consequence. Mr Deputy Speaker, this is in keeping with the Opposition's proposal for $3 billion in spending cuts before the March election. Do honourable members remember that? And there was the cry of the Leader of the Opposition after the August Budget that the Budget was not tough enough. Under this Labor Government, the Department of Social Security has been streamlined. It has become very efficient, delivering a generous income support system integrated with economic and wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of vital concern to Australians on lower incomes is the long term viable future of public housing funding. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement provides for more than $1 billion each year for the next three years to ensure the future and continued growth of public housing. It is difficult to believe, but the Liberal Party has actually proposed that, instead of increasing the public housing stock, money would be given in cash for people to remain in the private rental market. Can the House imagine a more preposterous system than one which puts Government money in the pockets of wealthy private landlords? The Liberals, in other words, would turn their backs on the great Australian dream of owning one's home and would condemn lower income Australians to a life of rental burden, without even the glimmer of hope of home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just addressed a few of these major issues arising out of this Bill dealing with funding for Commonwealth-State relations. It is an important Bill, which I believe should be well debated in the chamber because it has such a very dramatic effect on the standard of living of all Australians. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) spoke about the need for consultation and the role played in that during the time of the Fraser Government. The new federalism policy of the Fraser Government went a long way to reforming the fiscal imbalance that exists between the Commonwealth and the States. It went a long way in a number of aspects: firstly, it reduced the level of specific purpose grants and increased those that went in an untied form; and, secondly, it contained a major reform measure which was thwarted not by the Fraser Government but by the friends and colleagues of those honourable members who sit on the Government benches today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government introduced an income tax sharing arrangement with the States. It offered the States the ability to do what so often State Premiers have asked. State Premiers come to Premiers Conferences and constitutional conventions and say, `Give us taxing powers'. They say, `Yes, we believe that governments that spend the money should raise it'. But when they are offered a taxing power, that is the power they do not want. They always want the taxing power that is not under offer to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation to which I referred was introduced. The honourable member for Herbert referred to the fact that it was not used. It was not used because State governments refused to take up the offer that was given by the Fraser Government to Australians and to the Australian States to improve the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. That offer was rejected by the States and rejected most vehemently by the then Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran. He ran a totally dishonest campaign calling the Fraser Government's fiscal arrangements for the States a double taxation measure. It was not a double taxation measure; it was a measure to give the States the opportunity to raise their own revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year when the present Treasurer (Mr Keating) introduced the Incomes Tax (Arrangements with the States) Repeal Bill relating to the Fraser Government's legislation, I spoke in the debate and drew the attention of the House to the fact that that Bill should have been left on the statute books. The strange thing is that this year, as a result of the Special Premiers Conference and some of the rhetoric that we have heard come out of that, it appears that the present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) may be regretting the fact that that piece of legislation was repealed. </PARA>
<PARA> There were some inadequacies in its drafting and it allowed the States to impose a surcharge and grant a rebate. The States could have, for example, abolished their State payroll taxes and collected tax by means of a surcharge on income tax. For those States that were major exporters and wanted to encourage their export industry, it would have been a very good thing if they had reduced the tax on inputs and put it on the income of Australians. That could have maintained a neutral position with regard to the overall tax burden of the residents of the particular State but it could have had a very significant impact on their exporting industries. Similarly, if they had been able to run their affairs efficiently, States could have offered an income tax rebate. But no, they rejected that. My regret is that, when the Fraser Government introduced that legislation, it did not make the provision that the State tax was to be measured as a percentage of the Commonwealth's tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to use this opportunity to illustrate what I mean by that. The Bill that is now before the House is to authorise the payment to the States of general revenue grants. It is to authorise revenue grants to the extent of more than $13 billion. It is a huge amount of money. The Commonwealth and the States between them collect a large amount of revenue. Fifty per cent of the revenue collected from Australians is collected by the Commonwealth and 50 per cent is collected by State and local governments. The revenue is spent on a fifty-fifty basis but the Commonwealth collects 80 per cent and the States and local government collect 20 per cent. Forty per cent of the States' revenues come from the Commonwealth. Fifty per cent of those revenues go to the States through general revenue grants and 50 per cent of the money going from the Commonwealth goes through special purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at this particular legislation, we find that the $13 billion goes as the general revenue grants and the equalisation grants to the less populous States at amounts determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. If the equalisation grants are taken from the $13 billion, the amount paid to the States represents approximately 20 per cent of the income tax collections of the Commonwealth. In the current situation I think that the legislation which was repealed last year should be reintroduced, the Commonwealth should vary it by saying that the States shall be deemed to have levied what is today 20 per cent of the Commonwealth's income tax and that that should apply for 12 months or maybe two years. After that time that amount of income tax will not be collected by the Commonwealth unless the rate is set by State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been interesting to see the reaction of Premier Wran if the Commonwealth under the Fraser Government had calculated the grants that were going to New South Wales under general revenue grants, calculated them as a proportion of the income tax paid by the people of New South Wales and converted them into a rate with the same rate structure applied by the Commonwealth under income tax, and then said that the Commonwealth would pay it only for one year. I do not believe that Premier Wran would then have said it was double taxation; he would have very quickly acknowledged that it was New South Wales taxation that the New South Wales Government needed to provide the services of government to the people of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The present marginal rates are 21c, 25c, 30c, 38.5c, 42.5c, 46.5c, and 47c in the dollar. If it were apportioned between the Commonwealth and the States, the Commonwealth rate at the lowest level would be 16.8c in the dollar and the State rate would be 4.2c in the dollar. At the mid-rate of 38.5c total it would be 30.8c for the Commonwealth and 7.7c for the States. In that way, Australians would only have to put in one income tax return. In that way, the shape and progressivity of the rate structure and the size of the tax-free threshold could be set by the Commonwealth and the State revenue collections then could be determined by State governments instead of being set by this Parliament and then paid through the general revenue grants system. </PARA>
<PARA> Where possible, specific purpose grants should be converted into general revenue grants but where they relate to the payment of services to individual taxpayers or the families of individual taxpayers the Commonwealth should adopt the view that it funds people rather than institutions. If parents then pay for their children's education, they should receive tax relief to the extent of the cost of that education, whether that education is taken through the state system or through independent schools. Similarly, if people pay for their own health care they should receive a tax rebate to the extent of the insurance premium necessary for a cover equivalent to Medicare. The same approach should apply in relation to all services and all transfers that are made to individuals who are taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> In that way, the size of government could be substantially reduced. Firstly, the total amount of tax collections would be dramatically lowered because people would be empowered to spend on their own social responsibilities of education, health care and retirement income provision. They would be able to choose how they spent it and, provided they spent it in meeting those obligations, they should be given dollar for dollar tax reductions. That would reduce the amount of money collected by the Commonwealth from taxpayers. It would also substantially reduce the amount of money that the Commonwealth would need to spend on providing those services where it is the direct provider or on transferring those funds to States where they are the providers. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the States need money to meet other services that are not being provided directly to taxpayers, they should be absorbed in general revenue grants and distributed in the way I have outlined, not by the Commonwealth raising the tax, but by the States being obligated to impose the tax burden, being responsible to their own electorates for doing so, and hence being more responsible in the expenditure of those moneys. One would hope that States would also recognise the need to reduce the size of State government and that, to the extent that they now collect revenue to pay to taxpayers, they would leave the salary, wages and income in the pockets of Australians, enabling them to discharge their own personal responsibilities. In this way, they would not have their money taken, brought to a Treasury here or to a Treasury in one of the States and then doled out to them after having been through the hands of the intrusive bureaucracy that we have set up under legislation established by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the outcome of the Special Premiers Conference. I could not help but have a sense of deja vu. There was a lot of rhetoric about revenue sharing. I hope that in the interests of Australians the rhetoric turns into reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member is right. I do not think the Treasurer will wear it. I do not think some of the Labour Premiers will wear it, either. Many of them have heard the oft quoted statement, `The best tax so far as a State is concerned is a Commonwealth tax'. Premiers will talk about their desire to have the right to tax, but will not be prepared to face the responsibility of levying that tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The States have very broad taxing powers today which they do not use. They could impose an income tax if they wanted to. I am sure the Commonwealth would not use powers that it might have given unto itself during the Second World War to penalise them for collecting the tax. The Fraser Government would not have done so. If one relies on the rhetoric of the present Prime Minister, if the States were to impose an income tax in lieu of, as I illustrated earlier, a payroll tax, I do not think the Commonwealth would stand in the way of the States levying that tax. They might have a view, and we might all have a view, about the desirability or otherwise of having two income tax returns, but that is an administrative arrangement which could be sorted out so that the one return could be used to collect taxation on behalf of a Federal government, a State government or the two governments, and distributed appropriately between them. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a very wide power-what might be called a consumption tax power-but the States hide behind sections in the Constitution which were put there for sound historic reasons, that is, the exclusive nature of excises. That was put in the Constitution because of the difficulties being experienced by the colonies at the time of Federation as a consequence of differential excises and customs as between the then colony borders. Time has passed, but that section is still in the Constitution and the States shelter behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> The High Court of Australia has made it quite clear that States can impose franchise taxes. Because most businesses in a State operate from land, from sites, from factories, from buildings, the States have the power to say, `You can only serve petrol from this service station if you pay a franchise tax which is related to the amount of petrol you supply'. That power is not limited to petrol. That power could extend to every commodity sold within a State. Therefore, the States could exercise a broad-based franchise tax power, but they have not done so. In light of that, I become a little cynical when I read some of the decisions taken at the Special Premiers Conference. I hope that the senior expert officials who are to review the financial arrangements have more success in persuading their political masters than the Fraser Government had in not only persuading the Premiers of the day, but also persuading the bureaucrats who advised those Premiers. </PARA>
<PARA> The first working group was set up a week or so ago to assess the distribution of Commonwealth and State taxing powers. I would have thought we knew the answer to that. We know that the distribution of those powers is not necessarily the problem; it is the failure of the States to exercise the powers; and the failure of this Labor Government to leave the States with the power to administer a sensibly based income tax. This legislation could have provided that 20 per cent of the income tax now being collected by the Commonwealth was to go to the States-$10 billion plus the equalisation grant. </PARA>

That would put fiscal responsibility on the States. However, the Labor Government in Canberra is spineless.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purposes of this Bill are to amend the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act 1988 to implement decisions in the recent Budget on Commonwealth programs for schools in 1991 and to supplement for cost increases grants already appropriated for schools programs for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The major areas for which altered or new arrangements are proposed concern the special education program, a new literacy and learning program, additional assistance for disadvantaged schools, a new element of the capital grants program to support increased secondary school retention rates, and a new award restructuring assistance program to help meet additional costs arising from approved measures for teacher salary award restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of special education, government schools will receive additional funding through a 20 per cent loading on general recurrent grants for students with disabilities. Where students with disabilities attend non-government schools a per capita supplement will be paid in respect of such students equal to the difference between maximum general recurrent rates and the rates which apply for the funding category of the school. In addition, measures to reduce from seven to four the number of programs or program elements providing for special education, while maintaining coverage of the current client groups, will achieve greater flexibility and simplification in administrative processes. The disadvantaged schools program will receive additional funding to increase its coverage from the present 422,000 students to 500,000. </PARA>
<PARA> A new literacy and learning program will operate for three calendar years from 1 January 1991. The objective of the program is to improve learning in the junior secondary years by supporting the development of targeted professional development programs and their delivery to teachers in schools serving populations with high concentrations of disadvantaged groups. The program will be administered on a joint basis and will have a national element providing for collaborative developmental projects and a general element providing allocations to the States and the Northern Territory for professional development programs. </PARA>
<PARA> A new element of the capital grants program for 1991 and 1992 will fund projects which support increased secondary school retention rates in government schools and non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide an impetus to government and non-government school authorities to improve the quality of teaching by encouraging a process of restructuring of teacher salary awards in each sector in each State. The Commonwealth will provide financial assistance towards the additional costs incurred by government and non-government school authorities who undertake approved measures for award restructuring. These funds will be made available under the award restructuring assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill appropriates an estimated $2,440m for schools programs in 1991, and provides for additional funds for 1990 programs in line with cost supplementation arrangements to bring total funding for 1990 programs to an estimated $2,220m. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill gives effect to the Government's undertakings to establish a new form of housing assistance for members of the Defence Force who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985, and puts in place arrangements for the sale of the franchise to provide loans under the new scheme to the National Australia Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the Government's desire to establish a form of housing assistance which would encourage home ownership for members of the Australian Defence Force and which would provide an incentive for individuals to remain in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises the need to ensure that Defence Force personnel do not suffer any detriment in relation to home ownership as a result of the nature of their employment. The new form of housing assistance provided in this Bill is designed to meet these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme is available to all members of the Defence Force who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. In general, those who enlisted prior to that date remain eligible for assistance under the defence service home loans scheme, although those in this category who are still serving and have not exercised a defence service home loan entitlement may elect for assistance under the new scheme. Personnel in this position will be advised of the provisions of the new scheme and will be required to make their election by 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence Force personnel will generally need to have served for at least six years in order to become eligible for the new scheme. There are, however, special circumstances where this requirement will not apply, such as where an individual is involved in operational service in the Persian Gulf or is discharged as the result of a compensable medical condition. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme provides eligible personnel with a subsidised housing loan of up to $40,000. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40 per cent of the average interest that would ordinarily be payable over the term of the loan; the individual will be required to meet the remaining 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> With a view to retaining personnel in the Defence Force, the Government wished to ensure that the extent of assistance was linked to continuing service in the Defence Force. Thus, the subsidy will be available for the period of completed years which the individual continues to serve beyond the initial six year qualifying period. For example, a member of the Defence Force who has completed 14 years service is able to receive the subsidy for a period of eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> The loan may be taken out either during service with the Defence Force or at any time up until two years after the individual has left the Defence Force. The subsidy is available for a maximum period of 20 years. In order to become eligible for the subsidy, the individual will be required to reside in the house for which the loan has been provided. The loan may be transferred from one house to another while the individual serves in the Defence Force, and once during the first two years after the individual leaves the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 17 August 1990 the Government announced that the franchise to provide loans under the new scheme had been sold to the National Australia Bank. The bank will pay the Commonwealth $42m for the franchise, plus an additional annual commission, the amount of which will be dependent on the number of loans taken out in the year. The commission will commence at $975 per loan, increasing to $2,700 per loan by the year 2002. </PARA>
<PARA> Outlays on the new scheme will be dependent on the extent of take-up of subsidised loans. Assuming a take-up rate of 8 per cent, outlays in the 1990-91 financial year would amount to $135,000, rising to $1.779m in 1991-92, $4.187m in 1992-93 and $7.712m in 1993-94. These figures do not take account of those personnel who elect to relinquish their entitlement to a defence service home loan to take up assistance under the new scheme, a figure which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation will provide the framework for a worthwhile and effective scheme of housing assistance for Defence Force personnel. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>There is, I think, no doubt that the closing years of this decade will be remembered as one of the bleakest chapters in Australian corporate history. It is a period which has witnessed the collapse of a number of major players on the Australian corporate stage. Tragically, these collapses have brought with them some appalling losses of shareholders' and investors' funds. They have also brought to light evidence of outrageous irresponsibility and excesses on the part of the directors and management of some major corporations. The damaging effect of this behaviour on Australia's reputation in the international marketplace has been all too obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> These events have indelibly underscored the Government's long-held belief that corporate regulation and investor protection in this country has been inadequately served by the cooperative companies and securities scheme which had its genesis in a 1978 agreement between the then Commonwealth Government and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> A major flaw of the cooperative scheme has been the lack of a single, clearly defined line of ministerial responsibility to a single Parliament for the operation of the scheme. No single Minister or government has been able to be held properly accountable for the regulation of companies and securities in this country. The outcome has been fragmented administration, ineffective use of resources and the lack of consistent, coordinated and coherent direction in regulation and enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members will recall, the Government sought to redress the shortcomings of the cooperative scheme by the introduction in 1988 of an historic package of legislation designed to bring the administration of companies and securities law for the first time under a single and truly national regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The centrepiece of that legislation was the Corporations Act enacted by this Parliament in 1989 with strong business and investor support. That legislation brought together into a single legislative instrument the law regulating company law, company takeovers and the regulation of the securities and futures industries. In so doing it established a single line of ministerial and parliamentary responsibility for companies and securities regulation consistent with the fundamental principles of parliamentary democracy on which our society is founded. </PARA>
<PARA> Sole responsibility for the administration of those laws was conferred on a new national regulatory authority, the Australian Securities Commission (ASC), under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of history that the validity of the corporations legislation was challenged in the High Court by some States and that the High Court earlier this year decided, on the basis of a strict interpretation of section 51(xx) of the Constitution, that the Commonwealth could not legislate with respect to the act of incorporation of trading and financial corporations. That decision did not, however, reflect upon the capacity of the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise its plenary legislative power with respect to the governance and activities of such bodies after the formal act of incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the High Court did nothing to diminish the resolve of the Government to proceed on a national basis with the much needed reforms enshrined in the Corporations Act and the Australian Securities Commission Act. Events that had unfolded in corporate Australia between the introduction of that legislation in 1988 and the handing down of the High Court decision had provided further dramatic emphasis to the urgent need for the Government's proposed national regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accordingly sought urgent negotiations with the States and the Northern Territory with a view to gaining Australia-wide agreement for a scheme of national regulation which, while based on the Corporations Act 1989, would give due recognition to the constitutional role of the States in relation to the incorporation of trading and financial corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations in the months following the March general elections led to the conclusion at Alice Springs on 29 June 1990 of heads of agreement between Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers on future corporate regulation in Australia. The matters agreed in those heads of agreement are translated into the scheme to which the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill gives effect. </PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of the agreement between governments lies, on the one hand, a recognition by the States and the Northern Territory of the need for a national corporations law, administered by a single regulator responsible to a single Minister, government and parliament and, on the other hand, a recognition by the Commonwealth of the constitutional power of the States in relation to incorporation, and the interests of the States and the Northern Territory in the formulation of company law and the maintenance of satisfactory levels of regional service. </PARA>
<PARA> The heads of agreement and the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill strike a balance between those various interests in the following ways. The need to take account of the decision of the High Court in the corporations case, and to avoid any possible future constitutional uncertainties in relation to the new national legislation, are taken account of by resort to an application of laws regime broadly similar to that underpinning the current cooperative scheme legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Under that framework, the Bill converts the Corporations Act 1989 into a law under section 122 of the Constitution for the government of the Australian Capital Territory to be known as the Corporations Law of the Capital Territory. The corporations law will then be applied by State and Northern Territory application of laws Acts as the corporations law of each of those jurisdictions. In this way a single national corporations law will be enacted throughout Australia. Under the heads of agreement, governments are to seek the passage of the necessary legislation through their respective parliaments in time to enable the new national scheme to commence on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> While the application of laws regime will ensure that the new scheme, like its predecessor, is based on State and Territory law, the way in which that regime addresses issues of regulation, investigation and enforcement is fundamentally different. In the first place the separate roles of the State and Territory corporate affairs commissions as delegates of a central coordinating agency, currently the National Companies and Securities Commission, will be replaced by the conferment of sole administrative and regulatory authority on the Australian Securities Commission. The Commission in turn will be responsible to a Commonwealth Minister and the Commonwealth Parliament. This is to be achieved by amendments of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 and the conferment of corresponding powers, functions and responsibilities on the Australian Securities Commission under State and Northern Territory law by the various State and Northern Territory application of laws Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative regime will also greatly streamline and simplify the investigation and enforcement of offences under the corporations law as in force in each jurisdiction. This will be achieved by the adoption of a novel legislative device whose effect will, in summary, be to `federalise' such offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The `federalising' technique will involve each State and the Northern Territory providing in its application of laws legislation for the application to the investigation, prosecution and enforcement of offences under its corporations law of the provisions of relevant Commonwealth laws to the exclusion of State and Territory laws. One effect will be to confer investigatory, prosecutorial and other associated powers on the relevant Commonwealth authorities and officers to the exclusion of the corresponding State authorities and officers. Provision will be made for such powers to continue to be exercised by State authorities and officers in circumstances where arrangements are put in place between the Commonwealth and the relevant State or Territory government to enable the most efficient and effective use to be made of resources. Thus, for all practical purposes, offences under the corporations law of each jurisdiction will be treated as if they were offences under Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA> The same `federalising' technique will also be adopted by State and Northern Territory application of laws Acts to ensure that Commonwealth laws relating to freedom of information and judicial and administrative review of decisions of regulatory authorities under the corporations law apply to decisions under the corporations law to the exclusion of State administrative law regimes. Commonwealth judicial and other authorities and officers will exercise their powers under those laws to the exclusion of any corresponding powers conferred on State authorities and officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The exercise of jurisdiction by the courts of the States, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the Federal Court will similarly be the subject of a special legislative regime to give effect to the intention of governments that the new scheme have, so far as is practicable, the characteristics of a single national law. </PARA>
<PARA> Parallel civil jurisdiction under the corporations law will be conferred on the Supreme Courts of each State, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and the Federal Court of Australia. This important outcome of the agreement between governments will ensure freedom of choice to litigants between a local Supreme Court and the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The national character of the jurisdictional arrangements will be achieved by the cross-vesting of civil jurisdiction between the several State and Territory Supreme Courts and the Federal Court. In this way, the relevant State or Territory Supreme Court, or the Federal Court, will be able to be seized of all litigation relating to a particular matter irrespective of the particular State or Territory jurisdictions in which the various associated causes of action arose. As part of the cross-vesting mechanism, courts will have the discretion to transfer matters to other courts where it is in the interests of justice to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistently with the `federalising' of the investigation and prosecution of offences under the corporations law, criminal law jurisdiction will be exercisable exclusively by the relevant State, Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory courts in much the same way as offences under Commonwealth laws are, under the Judiciary Act, tried by State and Territory courts. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be achieved by the cross-vesting of the relevant State and Territory courts with jurisdiction to deal with offences under the corporations law of each other jurisdiction. No territorial limit will be placed on the jurisdiction of those courts to deal with indictable offences where those offences are alleged to have been committed either outside Australia or under the corporations law of the relevant State or Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid the legal and practical difficulties that would be involved in providing for the transfer between jurisdictions of criminal proceedings in relation to indictable offences in other circumstances, the legislation will place some territorial limits on the matters that may be dealt with by the criminal courts of each jurisdiction. Under these provisions the courts of each jurisdiction will be limited in such cases to dealing with indictable offences that are alleged to have been committed, begun or completed within that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions will, notwithstanding those necessary limitations, nevertheless provide considerable scope and convenience for a court in one jurisdiction to deal with associated offences that involve one or more other jurisdictions in addition to that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The courts of all States and the two mainland Territories will have full cross-vested criminal jurisdiction without limitation as to locality in respect of summary offences under the corporations law of each jurisdiction in the same way as those courts may exercise summary jurisdiction under the Judiciary Act in respect of summary offences under Commonwealth law wherever committed. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions of State and Territory courts exercising civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the Federal Court exercising civil jurisdiction, under a corporations law will be subject to the same hierarchy of appeals as with other matters ordinarily dealt with by those courts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other respects in which the Bill will introduce legislative mechanisms and requirements to ensure that the corporations laws of all jurisdictions together form a single national regime. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Bill and the State and Territory application of laws Acts will establish a regime for the citation of the corporations laws of each jurisdiction that will enable a simple reference in any instrument to the `corporations law', without more, to suffice, as a matter of law, as a reference to the corporations law of the relevant jurisdiction, or to two or more such laws, as the case requires. This will add simplicity and legal certainty to such things as documents filed with or issued by the Australian Securities Commission and indictments, pleadings and orders filed in or issued by courts exercising crossvested jurisdiction under the national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special importance is the way in which the new regime will deal with the matter of incorporation. As a consequence of the decision of the High Court in the corporations case, the incorporation of companies will continue, as a matter of constitutional necessity, to be rooted in the corporations law of a particular jurisdiction. That apart, the corporations law of each jurisdiction will, for most purposes of companies and securities regulation, treat companies incorporated in other Australian jurisdictions in the same way as companies incorporated in that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> At the practical level, incorporators will be able to seek incorporation under the corporations law of a nominated jurisdiction by filing the necessary documentation at any ASC office in Australia. Moreover, the legislation will enable filing and other obligations of an Australian incorporated company under any one or more corporations laws to be fully discharged under all of those laws by complying with the obligation in any one Australian jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> There will, however, be one area of regulation in which existing differences from jurisdiction to jurisdiction will be preserved for the time being. This is the area that can be broadly termed `fundraising' by the Crown in right of a State or Territory, by State and Territory public authorities, by other local statutory bodies and by special classes of corporations such as building societies, cooperatives, credit unions and friendly societies. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there has been no suggestion amongst governments that the incorporation or governance of such bodies should come within the new national scheme, there is a significant body of opinion, with which the Commonwealth is in agreement, that a single national fundraising regime should apply to most such bodies when they seek to raise funds outside their own jurisdictions of establishment or incorporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, the State and Northern Territory governments also recognise the need for reforms in that direction. The limited time available for the negotiation of the heads of agreement has not, however, enabled the implications of any reform in this area to be fully worked through by the State and Northern Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It has accordingly been agreed, and this is reflected in the legislation, that the status quo of the provisions of the co-operative scheme legislation should be continued on in the corporations law in relation to such bodies. This agreement has been reached on the understanding that the extent to which the new law should apply to those bodies will be reviewed by Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory Ministers as a matter of priority following the commencement of the new national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The respective roles of the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory in the future reform of companies and securities laws is a matter which has formed an important part in the negotiations between governments leading to the introduction of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill. Governments have agreed that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities established under the formal agreement relating to the cooperative scheme should continue in operation under the new national scheme, but with a redefined role and under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Minister. To that end a new formal agreement for signature by heads of government is currently under preparation. When that agreement has been signed, the Government will seek to have it annexed to the corporations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the future reform process, it has been agreed that the Ministerial Council will have a consultative role in respect of all legislative proposals and a deliberative role in relation to the reform of what can be broadly described as company law matters. Takeovers, securities, public fundraising and futures will be pre-eminently matters for the Commonwealth, subject to the general consultative role of the Ministerial Council. The Commonwealth will have four votes and a casting vote in the Ministerial Council; each State and the Northern Territory will have one vote. Importantly, the concurrence of the Commonwealth will be required for the introduction of any company law reform proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the importance to the States and Northern Territory of the maintenance by the Australian Securities Commission of regional levels of service. To this end, a number of commitments undertaken by the Commonwealth in the heads of agreement will be inscribed also in the new formal agreement. For its part, the Government believes that levels of service in each jurisdiction will be significantly enhanced, especially having regard to the establishment by the Australian Securities Commission of a national database for companies and a state-of-the-art document imaging system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also agreed that regional commissioners of the ASC should be appointed by contract outside the framework of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and that the State and Northern Territory Ministers should be consulted in respect of such appointments. The Bill amends the Australian Securities Commission Act to provide for such appointments by contract. The Commonwealth's obligation to consult with the State and Northern Territory Ministers on these appointments will be amongst the provisions of the new formal agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters of considerable importance to State and Northern Territory governments in agreeing to the new national scheme has been their desire to preserve their capacity to levy stamp duty on share transactions and charges. To meet these concerns the Commonwealth has agreed to the inclusion in each corporations law provisions that will ensure, in combination with local stamp duty laws, that State and Territory stamp duties are leviable on off-market transactions in the securities of companies incorporated in their respective jurisdictions, and that charges, wherever registered, have been stamped in all jurisdictions in which property secured by them is located. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the agreement between governments for the new national scheme, State and Northern Territory governments will forgo revenue currently received in respect of companies and securities regulation. Under the heads of agreement the Commonwealth has agreed to reimburse the States and the Northern Territory to the extent of $102m per annum indexed in line with the consumer price index from a 1989-90 base. An interim formula has been agreed in respect of revenue forgone in 1990-91 and is reflected in the Budget presented to the Parliament. The detailed arrangements for revenue reimbursement will be included in the new formal agreement currently under preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already emphasised this Government's grave concern at recent developments in the corporate sector, but our concerns will not end with the passage of this Bill and the associated State and Northern Territory application of laws Acts. The Government has a substantial and growing agenda of matters requiring urgent legislative reform. I mention loans to directors and the recently endorsed recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on insider trading, as but two examples. These and other matters will be the subject of legislative proposals that the Government intends to bring forward to the Parliament next year. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime the Government is taking the opportunity afforded by this Bill to introduce, in addition to amendments necessary to give effect to the matters recently agreed by governments, reforms that will give effect to matters on which agreement has previously been reached in the context of the cooperative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Bill will include in the corporations law provisions on buy-backs that correspond to those included in the cooperative scheme legislation subsequent to the enactment of the Corporations Act, and various amendments necessary to take account of fast moving improvements in technology related to a national corporate information system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also deals with a range of transitional matters. These include provisions giving effect to the agreement of Ministers that, from the date of commencement of the new national scheme, the Commonwealth will assume responsibility for the investigation and enforcement of cooperative scheme offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is also being taken to make some technical revisions to provisions of the Corporations Act that are in need of correction or clarification. One such amendment will put beyond doubt the capacity of the Australian Securities Commission, in the course of an investigation or legal proceedings, to seek a court order for the protection, or the appointment of a receiver, of the property of a unit trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill and the State application of laws legislation will together usher in a new era of corporate regulation in this country. The national scheme embodied in that legislative package will offer for the first time in the nation's history a single and truly national regulatory regime that can guarantee a sound and well regulated environment for corporate activity. Without such an environment, business in this country cannot prosper as it should, and investors, both at home and abroad, will lack the security and confidence that is essential to our future economic growth and well-being. </PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill before the House, the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990, is a Bill that really could be introduced only in a country such as Australia. When we look at the make-up of the operations of government in Australia, we find six States, two Territories and, of course, the Commonwealth Government. I think few countries in the world would be governed to the same extent as Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we have these different levels of government, not to mention local governments, then we come across the problem of differentiating powers. The Bill tonight looks at the distribution of moneys or taxes collected between different levels of government and the disbursement thereof for the provision of services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I came into the House at the tail end of the last contribution by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson). What the honourable member was putting before the House, if my memory serves me correctly, was that State governments should have access to income taxing powers, and he was suggesting something of the order of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us with a bit of memory may remember that the former Liberal Government of Mr Fraser actually went some way towards giving or allowing the States those powers. Legislation was passed through this House and through the Senate, and I believe it is still on the statute books, that gave the States that option, if they wanted it. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to look at the whole structure of Australia and ask: Is this one country or is it six or seven countries? It may well be theoretically possible to have six States, all with differing tax regimes and tax scales, providing different services, but in the end the Australian people feel that we are one nation, that we are a Commonwealth, and certainly that many of the benefits people enjoy-social security benefits and education for their children, for example-should be of a common standard. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that when one looks at most of the countries around the world, and certainly countries with a population similar to ours, one understands that most of them would not have the arguments that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks back to where we came from-and we are a relatively young country-one realises that back in the 1800s it made some sense to have local governments, given the difficulty of communication and the distances involved in Australia. Back in those days there would not have been a place like Canberra-it did not exist-to tell places like Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane how to run their affairs. It made sense in those days to have strong local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> When we became a nation in 1901 technology had advanced somewhat, and the founding fathers of the Australian Constitution sat down and came up with what was then a workable Constitution. We have progressed since that time. Nowadays we can talk to Canberra directly or get from Perth or Adelaide to Canberra in a matter of hours. </PARA>

Now we can travel across Australia in a matter of hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are going to keep up with changes in technology and changes in communication, we have to change also. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Sturt asked me whether I would get rid of the States. Yes, I would. If I sat down today to frame a Constitution to serve this country, I would not have States. Why would one do so?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I would have a very strong local government. That is all that is needed. When I look at some of the State governments in this country, I do not think anyone in his right mind would advocate the sorts of powers they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Returning to my former point, I emphasise that basically we are one country, and basically most of the people in Australia, given a choice, would believe that their fellow countrymen-whether they live in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland or Tasmania-should have access to the support systems in the social security field, and the educational systems in primary, secondary and tertiary education, that they enjoy. It seems to make sense to me. </PARA>
<PARA> To answer the point the honourable member for Sturt made in his contribution, when we have a look at the evolution of the taxing powers in Australia we see that they seem to have been centralised under both governments, whether Labor or conservative. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Wilson" NAMEID="0K4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr Wilson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's not right.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think history will prove that I am right. The fact is that the centralisation of power, the taxing powers, have accrued to the Federal Government. The father of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies, had to comment that where the taxing powers resided with the Commonwealth it had a duty to make sure that those taxes were well spent. I think most of us would endorse that. To give the States the income taxing powers and to allow differentiation between States would reinforce the fact that we are like six or seven different countries. I would have thought that in 1990, as we head towards the next century, Australia would have learnt from the old days when we had six different railway systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the recent Special Premiers Conference in Queensland I believe we made great steps forward. I think the Premiers and the Commonwealth Government showed a lot of goodwill and commonsense in recognising that under the Constitution there were limitations in the way that we could run our country. They recognised that if we hoped to achieve the maximum potential we could under the set of conditions that were laid down for us in 1901, cooperation would be the way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that as a result of the Special Premiers Conference we have made progress in certain areas, but not in the area of education. I have to agree with my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that it seems from what was reported to have been said at the conference and what was said before and after the conference that the consistency of sausages was more important than the consistency of education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from my days as a lecturer in technical and further education that even back in the early 1980s TAFE was moving towards a system. It recognised that it was ludicrous to have six or seven different TAFE systems across Australia all duplicating each other. Fundamentally, because TAFE is a much more practical area of education those involved actually sat down and tried to do something about it themselves. At that time there was no ministerial directive, but working parties were set up by lecturers themselves. In the area in which I taught-electrical trades-we reached a lot of consistency across Australia without having to worry about the political process. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that if Australia once again is to reach its potential we should not be duplicating services across Australia. We should not have to worry about the fact that the different States have different age requirements for when our young kids start school, that they have different standards, different handwriting styles. It seems so ludicrous when we sit back and look at it. Why should we be governed by what States have done in the past? Why should we not recognise that in 1990 this is a country that is going to reach its maximum potential if we use the scarce resources we have, whether they be in curriculum development or any other area of government activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Another classic example is the differing food standards across Australia. We have now been a nation since 1901, just about 90 years, and we still cannot agree on food standards. It really does speak volumes for the way in which we have conducted ourselves in the past. I honestly believe that the Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane made significant steps and there is a greater awareness now of the fact that if we coordinate our efforts each of the levels of government will have less of the costs involved in maintaining all of those different structures and maybe with the expertise involved in areas like education, food processing, industrial relations, and in a number of other areas that I could name basically we could have a better system, in fact, better standards--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The honourable member may well ask, but certainly we should use the best brains in this country to come up with standards. If we could only agree as one country, we would have a better system of government and a better standard of government. As to who would collect the revenue, I suppose in principle the honourable member would be attracted to the proposition that the people who spend the money should collect the money. I suppose theoretically, as an ideal, a concept, that is not a bad way to go. I suppose it reinforces the argument of the honourable member for Sturt. But once again we come up against practical considerations. Even when the States were given the opportunity of doing that by the previous conservative government, they did not want to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be that as a result of the Special Premiers Conference in Queensland we do go down that path. I would not rule it out. The only thing I would say is that history has taught us that when the States were given the opportunity they did not accept it. The reason that they did not accept it is that nobody likes to be tagged as the taxer. It always has a negative connotation. It is much easier for State Premiers to talk about the high taxing government in Canberra to make a political point than to point out that through the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill and Bills like it and Premiers Conferences a lot of that money is actually given back to the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To illustrate that, I refer to one of the most dishonest campaigns that has been run in recent times; it relates to road funding. I do not have the exact figures with me, but certainly when the Royal Automobile Club and the National Roads and Motorists Association talked about the low level of money collected at the petrol bowser actually going back into roads they were more devious than any politician in this place could ever be because all they were talking about was the money that the Federal Government had actually spent on roads. They never spoke about the money that local government and State governments put back into roads. When that is added together, the percentage of the revenue collected from petroleum excise rises significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> When we have the system that we have now, people can get away with arguments like that. I suppose the honourable member for Sturt had a point when he said that theoretically the people who spend the tax should collect it. Then arguments like that could not be trotted out. I agree with him, but I go back to the point I made before. When the States were given the opportunity they did not grab it. The honourable member says we should make them grab it, we should make them collect the tax. That does not sound like a Liberal Party person speaking. The Liberal Party, of course, speaks for individual freedom and believes that governments should be free to do what they like. A few of its members talk about States rights still-not about people's rights, of course-and the fact that under our Constitution States should be free to do this and do that. But we have evolved into the present situation and the question is how we get out of it. I have to say that this Government is the only one that has sat down in a meaningful way, set up a Premiers Conference and has at least got the State Premiers thinking in a positive way about ways in which we might address our institutional problems--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Included also in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990 is a provision that has been included to complement the measures proposed under the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990 to prevent the States hindering the imposition of compulsory student union fees by higher education institutions. It is interesting to look at the way in which some States view student union fees even though those student union fees go towards paying for many of the facilities that students enjoy in their higher education institutions. It is a wider argument about union fees themselves and whether people who benefit from the activities underwritten by union fees should be required to contribute towards them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia, if a person does not pull his or her weight, then he or she is called a bludger. In union terms if a person does not want to join the union but wants to accept the benefits that the union has fought for, then he or she is a bludger. I believe that the Bill contains a provision to make sure that States with a philosophical argument that union fees should be voluntary will be picked up by the provisions in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I am always amazed that when people talk about union fees, some people with a philosophical bent-not all-talk about union fees and the fact that they should be voluntary. In days past one could reconcile that with the fact that the taxation system was run in the same way-that is, voluntary tax for those who really wanted to pay it and voluntary unionism for those who wanted to belong to unions. In the real world, neither policy works. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to speak in opposition to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1990, which seeks to authorise grants to the States for a number of purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) have comprehensively discussed a number of aspects of the Bill. My particular concern relates to clause 12 of the Bill, which serves to enforce conditions of funding contained in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), the conditions in question are those contained in the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1990. It perhaps says something about the manner in which the Government conducts its legislative program that this Bill seeks to complement provisions which have yet not even been enacted. The second reading of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill is yet to be debated. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of clause 12 of this Bill, as with the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, is to entrench the practice of compulsory membership of student unions, or, more precisely, it seeks to protect the capacity of tertiary institutions to force students to join a student union and pay the appropriate fee as a precondition of entry into the tertiary institution. It does this by penalising any State which seeks to prevent tertiary institutions from undertaking this obnoxious practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government, through this Bill, is telling the States that if States seek to protect the basic rights of students by ending the practice of coerced membership of student unions, the States will suffer a financial penalty. The penalty they will suffer will equate with the revenue the institutions lose as a result of a change to voluntary membership provisions of the student union. </PARA>
<PARA> Before discussing the issue of compulsory membership of student unions in detail, let me make some observations about why we are debating this Bill tonight. Quite simply, the Australian Labor Party knows that its State counterparts are in trouble. It knows that in two to three years time the political landscape of Australia will be transformed and that Labor governments, such as of those of Kirner and Lawrence, will be, thankfully, a fading memory. Labor is frightened. Just as it relies heavily on trade unions whose foundations are built on forced membership, so Labor also relies on student unions. Student unions, like trade unions, are training grounds for future Labor politicians, training grounds generously subsidised by the coerced exaction of fees from the rest of the student body. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly if this Bill passes, and then as State governments are dismissed from office, the Federal Labor Government, if its present term lasts that long, will be able to utilise the mechanisms of this Bill to restrain the inevitable shift to voluntary student unionism. The one flaw in the strategy is that the Federal Government is as much on the nose as its State counterparts. It will not be long after the demise of the State governments that Federal Government members will be making their own trek to the Opposition benches. When the coalition is back in government, not only will we not utilise the powers provided in this Bill but, if it is passed, we will repeal it. Not only will we repeal it, we will frame a Bill to ensure that the civil rights of students are respected and that the practice of coerced membership of student unions is banned. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I have the opportunity of discussing the basis of the coalition's opposition to compulsory student unionism when the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill comes back for debate, I will now take the opportunity to outline the Opposition's views. To the student who does not wish to join a student union when enrolling in a tertiary institution, the practice of forced membership effectively boils down to forcing the student to violate his or her deeply held political beliefs as a precondition for enrolment. In so doing, it violates that student's right to freedom of association and the equally fundamental right of freedom not to associate-rights considered so integral that they are referred to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the issue of coerced membership of student unions, it is always useful to go back to first principles. What is freedom of association and freedom not to associate and why do we value them?</PARA>
<PARA> Because it will be said that this debate has political overtones, I consider it useful to illustrate the civil rights dimension of this issue by referring to other rights. For example, let us take the right to freedom of religion. Every citizen has a right to engage in a religion that accords with his beliefs. If the right of any Australian to engage in a religion were interfered with, a predictable uproar would ensue. Parallel to this right, there is a right not to engage in a religion if a person is so inclined. This right is equally fundamental for the essence of freedom is choice-a choice to engage in something and a choice not to so engage. Once again, if the right of someone to abstain from practising a religion were interfered with or if one were coerced to practise a religion against one's will, there would be overwhelming public opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Except for changing the right from freedom of religion to freedom of association, nothing that I have said would change with respect to the issue at hand. We all value and treasure the rights of students, or for that matter anyone, to associate with whomever they wish. We equally value the comparable right not to associate with individuals and organisations as the case maybe. </PARA>
<PARA> Other arguments have been proffered in opposition to membership of student unions, particularly political student unions, arguments referring to their unrepresentative character, as is proven year after year through the dismal turnout at student elections. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Dr Bob Woods" NAMEID="1K4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very like ATSIC. There are arguments, based on the same reasoning as with ATSIC, that the unions are not seen to be relevant to the students voting in the election. There are also arguments referring to the extremist political positions that these unions often assume. These arguments are, indeed, correct. The political arms of students tend to be very unrepresentative and often propagate extremist political views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But even if the student unions were able to attract a higher turnout at elections and even if their political positions were closer to the mainstream, we would still oppose any provision requiring compulsory membership because it violates our basic liberal values for anyone to associate with any organisation against his or her wishes. No student union, or any organisation for that matter, no matter how successful, has the prerogative to violate the rights of others and to impose their values upon others. </PARA>
<PARA> What I have said exposes the fallacy of what might superficially appear to be the strongest argument of those who support coerced membership of student unions-that is, the free rider argument, the argument that because students receive services they should be required to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, it is wrong to believe that students necessarily benefit from the activities of student unions. Many students either do not use the services of the union or find the union to be acting contrary to their interests. It is wrong to believe that even if a student does so benefit, this is a ground for coercing membership. It maybe said that we all benefit from the voluntary actions of a whole host of organisations, yet in our democratic society these organisations are not given the right to trample over our rights. Indeed, I would suggest that if this is a concern, the onus is on the union to restrict what it perceives to be the benefits of membership to its members. It is by no means impractical to organise the provision of services to members and to charge non-members. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is wrong to believe that the objector is the free rider. The real free riders are those who seek to utilise the compulsorily acquired funds of others to finance their political activities. It is for this reason that we do not merely oppose compulsory membership of student unions, but we oppose compulsory membership of all student organisations and all unions, be they student representative councils, university unions or student guilds. </PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion, the argument that political student unions can somehow be distinguished from service unions holds no currency. Being forced to join either type of union against one's will constitutes a violation of the right to freedom of association. We have a strongly held belief that voluntary student unionism has a much better chance of being democratic than forced unionism because there is a real incentive on the part of leaders to increase participation in voluntary organisations. A voluntary organisation knows that limits to its membership limit its financial strength. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no mistake that the compulsion to join a student union is enforced by depriving students of their education. In 1978 the University of Western Australia expelled 42 students who refused to pay compulsory services and amenities fees. In 1989 in South Australia a student was refused graduation because of his refusal to pay a union fee. At the Australian National University it was decided on one occasion to refuse to correct a student's examination paper on this ground. Not surprisingly, for a party which has always favoured central control and which has historically had little sympathy for philosophies which confer paramountcy on the rights of the individual, Labor supports compulsory student unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> More regrettably, this practice has rarely evoked opposition from those who claim to be defenders of civil rights and, indeed, it also enjoys some degree of support amongst the academic community. To those who claim to fight for civil rights yet remain silent in the face of forced membership of student unions I say this: it does no credit to such people that they ignore this right, and the persistent violation of the right to freedom of association, both in the employment sector and in the education sector, is rarely if ever discussed, not to mention condemned, at civil and human rights conferences which are held on so regular a basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Civil rights are not things that one can pick and choose amongst. Where we say that we will protect only the rights of those with whom we agree, of those whose views accord with our own beliefs, we do not have civil rights. Nor is it acceptable to argue that financial or administrative convenience overrides civil rights. These so-called defenders of civil liberties have condemned themselves by their silence. </PARA>
<PARA> To the academic community, I would say that it is a matter of regret to me that there are academics who, whilst quite vocal in their legitimate claims for freedom and autonomy, particularly in their teaching and research activities, are either indifferent to or hostile to similar claims for freedom from students. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of surprise and regret to me that whilst almost every, if not every, tertiary institution in this country has its equal opportunity and anti-discrimination officers and committees, I have yet to read of one which has taken up this issue. I have yet to read of one which has said that forcing a student to join a body against his or her will is a violation of that student's right to freedom of association. I have yet to read of one which has said that threatening a student with expulsion because, in accordance with his or her political views, he or she does not wish to join a student union constitutes a form of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> The mentality of pick and choose is rife. As soon as we come across a student whose political views differ from those valued by such committees, the rights of that student are devalued and ignored. I wish to say to the academic community that no amount of effort can rationalise the inconsistency between calling for institutional autonomy and academic freedom on the one hand and then forcing the students to join what are often highly political student unions on the other on threat of expulsion from their education. Universities and the academic community weaken themselves by demanding for themselves what they deny to others. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say to the Government that this is a most cynical piece of legislation. Indeed, we are entitled to be suspicious of the Government's motives and intentions. No government has attracted more criticism than this one for the systematic manner in which it has attacked university autonomy. The Executive Director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee recently told a graduation ceremony at the Australian National University:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . while Mr Dawkins was at pains at the outset to claim that the system would be deregulated and that institutional autonomy would be preserved, the reality is there is scope for much more Government control over higher education institutions than there was in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>We are entitled to be suspicious of a government which has taken to itself the power to tell institutions what they can teach, what research they can undertake and how they should manage their affairs, but then suddenly rediscovers institutional autonomy when it comes to allowing institutions to violate the basic rights of students. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether this new found commitment to institutional autonomy would be so apparent if universities had the opposite but equally offensive policy of preventing students associating in student unions. I suspect not. Voluntary student unionism can work and can be effective. Many services can be provided-and effectively provided-on a commercial contract basis. Institutions with financial flexibility can, of course, provide facilities and services to their students on their own account. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it was the establishment of the funding monopoly by the Whitlam Government which led to the demand for compulsory student unionism as an entrenched feature of tertiary education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Monopoly begat monopoly. Lack of funding flexibility ended in the abrogation of the rights of students. Government domination entrenched their coercion into student unions. I believe that there are those in the Australian Labor Party who do have a genuine commitment to civil rights. To date these individuals have simply abstained from the debate on student unionism, treating the issue as if it did not exist. If they genuinely support civil rights they must convince their colleagues that this is an unacceptable practice and that legislation enforcing it is unacceptable. I foreshadow that during the committee stage we will oppose clause 12. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill represents the completion of action by the Government which has resolved a developing crisis with the State Bank of Victoria. It will at the same time strengthen the Commonwealth Bank and enable it to develop further as a major national institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will create a new structure for the Commonwealth Bank as a public company, so that the additional capital it must have for the acquisition can be contributed by all Australians as joint shareholders with the Government. Grasping the opportunity to acquire the State Bank will secure the future of the Commonwealth Bank as a flourishing enterprise, and a central one in Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquisition of the business of the State Bank will bring the Commonwealth Bank the substantial share of the banking market in Victoria which it has lacked until now, and will make it the largest Australian bank in terms of domestic assets. The Commonwealth Bank will become for the first time in its history a major institutional force. The purchase of the State Bank will enable it to mount a competitive challenge which the other major banks will have their work cut out to meet. </PARA>
<PARA> The great strength of the State Bank of Victoria is as a retail banking business. For a time earlier this year the losses sustained in Tricontinental Holdings, its merchant bank subsidiary, and losses in the State Bank itself, threatened to overwhelm it. If the public had come to doubt the ability of the Victorian Government to deal with the enormous financial consequences of Tricontinental's losses, confidence in the State Bank would have been undermined. </PARA>
<PARA> It is Australia's fifth largest bank with extensive liabilities overseas, and a loss of confidence in it would have threatened the very stability of Australia's financial system. This was a situation which the Commonwealth Government could not allow to occur. Fortunately, the Victorian Government for its part faced up to its responsibilities, and decided that given its own budget position, the only fully adequate way to deal with the situation was to offer the State Bank for sale. That decision does the Victorian Government great credit. </PARA>
<PARA> It offers a sharp contrast to the circumstances of the Commonwealth Bank's acquisition of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales in 1931, which are worth briefly recalling. During 1930 a run on deposits in the Government Savings Bank had developed. It reached panic proportions in March and April of 1931, and culminated in the closing of the bank on 23 April 1931. Negotiations between the Commonwealth Bank and the New South Wales Government eventually led to the acquisition of the Government Savings Bank by the Commonwealth Bank, but not before great distress had been caused to the people of New South Wales. The tragedy of it was described by J.T. Scullin in this House on 16 October 1931:</PARA>
<PARA>Had the serious position of the State Savings Bank been firmly grappled with a few weeks before the bank closed, the business could have been taken over by the Commonwealth Bank as a going concern without financial loss to the Government or people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>In this case, the State Bank of Victoria is being taken over as a going concern, and a valuable one now that Tricontinental has been separated from it. As part of the Commonwealth Bank, it will continue to serve the people of Victoria. The Commonwealth Bank, after its due diligence and review of the State Bank, has today signed a contract to buy it for $1,600m. That price reflects the addition which will be made to the net earnings of the Commonwealth Bank when it has added and integrated the business of the State Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will authorise the payment of an amount not exceeding $413m as compensation to Victoria for the revenues forgone through the Victorian Government's sale of the State Bank and the tax losses it has agreed not to access after taking Tricontinental back into direct ownership. I intend the payment to be made in the near future, when an agreement is in place specifying the tax related conditions and a mode of payment which involves debt redemption by the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other main purpose of the Bill is to restructure the Commonwealth Bank and convert it into a public company, in order to raise from the public the additional capital necessary to fund the Bank's acquisition of the State Bank of Victoria. It is the value of the Commonwealth Bank as an institution, and the services which it provides to the community, which are paramount-and not whether it is exclusively government owned. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure we are creating, with the Government as permanent majority shareholder and non-government shareholders as a substantial minority, will give the Commonwealth Bank access to additional capital while preserving its unique quality as a government owned major bank. The Commonwealth Bank as a government owned and government guaranteed bank has a vital place in our financial system. It represents an entirely secure place to deposit money, which is something that many customers throughout Australia value. It represents a discipline on other banks in the kinds of credit risks they can assume, and so contributes to proper banking practice in the system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The bank has established its track record as a commercial and profitable business under full government ownership. Under this Government the Commonwealth Bank has become more commercially oriented, more soundly managed, better equipped for the future, and more profitable. That strong record is a good basis from which the Commonwealth Bank's first offer of shares to the public can be launched. </PARA>
<PARA> The advent of non-government shareholders will not require the Government to become a passive shareholder and to disappear from the picture. As Treasurer, I shall be carrying the responsibility for the Government's guarantee of the liabilities of the bank, which is not to be altered by this Bill. I shall also be carrying responsibility for the large investment of all citizens of the Commonwealth in the bank, which will not have been diminished in any way by the issue of shares to additional shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to know what policies are being followed by the bank and to see that it continues to be run wisely, efficiently and profitably. In this, I expect I shall be fully in accord with its other shareholders. With these continuing government responsibilities in mind, the Bill will retain in the Commonwealth Banks Act a number of its existing provisions which help to define the Government's relationship with the bank-in a few cases, with modifications to reflect the bank's conversion to a public company. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 9, containing the bank's `charter' responsibilities to the people of Australia and the Australian economy, will remain. Section 11, providing for an annual corporate plan to be prepared and given to the Treasurer, and containing a power for the Government ultimately to prevail in the circumstances of a formal difference of opinion, will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> A power will remain for the Treasurer to appoint the Secretary to the Treasury as a member of the board of the bank-which I propose to use. At the same time, the conversion of the bank to a company and the issuing of shares to non-government shareholders will bring about other positive changes. Firstly, with the conversion of the Commonwealth Bank to a share company there will be an opportunity for it to have an employee share ownership plan. I intend to see that there will be such a plan, established quickly, and integrated with the plan for the first issue of shares to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, part of the restructuring of the bank done through this Bill is a change in the legal status of the Commonwealth Development Bank. It has until now been a separate bank under the same ownership, the same board and the same managing director. The Bill will make it a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, in the same way as the Commonwealth Savings Bank has been for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Development Bank's special charter will remain unaltered under its new status. It will continue to act as a specialised lender to, and financier of, small business. Thirdly, the issue of shares to the public will introduce a new kind of market scrutiny of the bank's performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend that the bank will be able to have its shares listed by the Australian Stock Exchange, which will maximise the tradeability of the shares and will also focus analysis on the bank's performance relative to other listed banks. I expect that this market attention and analysis will add a further discipline and stimulus for the bank's board and management. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish briefly to describe the features of the share structure of the Commonwealth Bank for which the Bill specifically provides. Foreigners will be prohibited from subscribing to the first public issue of shares in the Commonwealth Bank. The aim of this restriction is to give priority to Australian residents in subscribing to shares in the bank. However, foreigners will not be prevented from buying shares from subscribers and holding them thereafter. The wish of foreign persons to buy some of these shares in trading after the issue will add substantially to the effective demand for the shares, and hence to the prospects of success of the issue and to the market value of the new shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of voting shares to be held in aggregate by persons other than the Commonwealth will be limited to 30 per cent through the Commonwealth Banks Act. This will operate as a binding restriction on both the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank. As a separate matter, the Commonwealth will be prohibited from selling any of its shares in the bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Through amendments which this Bill makes to the Banks (Shareholdings) Act, interests in voting shares in the Commonwealth Bank will be limited. Domestic and foreign banks will not be permitted to have any interest, directly or through associate relationships, except that banks or entities within banking groups will be permitted to hold voting shares as managers or trustees on behalf of other beneficial owners. No person apart from the Commonwealth is to have an interest exceeding 5 per cent of the voting shares in the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the changes being made through this Bill are historic. We shall have created from the existing Commonwealth Bank and State Bank of Victoria a whole new force in banking, while protecting the State Bank's depositors and the wider community of Victoria and averting a financial calamity. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also like to just place on record my personal appreciation in the negotiation of this transition to, in the first instance, my principal private secretary, Dr Don Russell; Mr George Pooley and John Eyers of the Treasury; the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Tim Besley; the Managing Director, Mr Sanders; and Mr David Murray; and, on the Victorian side, the Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner; her Treasurer, Mr Roper; the Minister for Economic Planning, Mr David White; and their adviser, Mr Philip Herrington. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 contains amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Defence Service Homes Act 1918, the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 4) 1989 and the Public Service Act 1922. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will amend veterans' affairs legislation to implement election promises announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in March 1990 to provide for the automatic grant of pensions and benefits to widows and dependants of veterans receiving extreme disablement adjustment and extend the operation of the Defence Service Homes Act 1918. It will also give effect to Budget decisions and make a range of other amendments to improve administration and benefits to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also provide additional repatriation and defence service homes benefits to certain Australian Defence Force personnel deployed for operational service in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing these repatriation benefits, the Government recognises that Australian Defence Force personnel deployed for operational service in the Middle East face a very real danger as a result of that service. The Government has decided therefore that all Australian Defence Force personnel allotted for operational service in the Middle East, including those deployed with United States or United Kingdom units, would be regarded as being on operational service once they reach the operational area. Until such time as they reach the operational area, they would be regarded as being on hazardous service. This would ensure that they receive the benefit of the more generous standard of proof in determining eligibility for compensation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> With the introduction of these amendments they will have access to disability pensions on the same generous standard of proof basis as war veterans. They will qualify for service pensions and thus have entitlement to the equivalent of the age pension benefits five years earlier, as do war veterans. They will be eligible for repatriation medical treatment and associated benefits on the same basis as war veterans. Those service personnel who enlisted in the Australian Defence Force on or before 14 May 1985 will have access to subsidised low interest housing loans, insurance and other housing benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act. Those who enlisted after that date will be entitled to housing ownership assistance under the Australian Defence Force home loans assistance scheme to be implemented early in 1991. Finally, in the event of a member's service resulting in severe or fatal injury or disease, cover under the Act will also be available to that member's dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another provision of the Bill which relates to arrangements for allotting personnel for service in an operational area. The special benefits under the Act available to persons who serve on operational service are in recognition of the special dangers associated with operational service. Until recently, the allotment provisions have not caused any difficulties because the term has always been regarded as having a special meaning. This is no longer the case. In the recent cases of Doessel and Davis, the Federal Court construed the phrase `allotted for duty' as being equivalent to `posted for duty'. On this interpretation, a person who served in an operational area but who was not specifically allotted for `operational service' for the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act would qualify as having had operational service, even though that service was not at a time when it involved increased danger. </PARA>
<PARA> To restore the intended purpose of `allotted for duty', this Bill will give a special meaning to references in the Act to that term. In addition, the amendments would confirm that allotment may be in accordance with retrospective arrangements most often necessarily followed by the Department of Defence. The changes would also provide that allotment would be by written instrument, that it can be retrospective or otherwise and that such instruments will be issued by the Defence Force for use by the Repatriation Commission in determining a person's eligibility for entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A further provision would be made to take account of new arrangements instituted by the Department of Defence to allot-by written instrument signed by the Vice-Chief of the Defence Force-units and individuals for operational service in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Savings provisions are included in the Bill so as not to disadvantage anyone in respect of whom a determination to grant eligibility has already been made or anyone who has lodged a claim or application on or before 8 November 1990 and which has not been decided. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill would also give effect to the payment of the pharmaceutical allowance from 20 March 1991. This special allowance is to offset the cost of the charges for prescriptions under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. These measures would ensure that no pensioners would be disadvantaged as a result of the introduction of these new charges. </PARA>
<PARA> To retain consistency with the Department of Social Security in the administration of the income and assets test, this Bill will introduce similar amendments to those proposed by the Department of Social Security to deem a minimum rate of interest of 10 per cent on all cash and deposits held by pensioners in excess of $2,000 in assessing the rate of pension payable. This Bill would provide for the rate of deemed interest to be periodically reviewed. Specific provision is made in the Bill to ensure that pensioners who are eligible for health benefits cards on 28 February 1991 will not lose them as a result of the operation of the deeming provisions. The deeming provisions would apply from 1 March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also proposes changes to a range of other benefits to achieve more efficient administration and a more equitable distribution of benefits to veterans and dependants. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> - the removal of the three-year minimum service requirement for `hazardous service', which entitles veterans to the more generous standard of proof in deciding claims;</PARA>
<PARA> - an increase in the rent assistance threshold by $10 a fortnight to $50 a fortnight from March 1991 for both single pensioners and pensioner couples to ensure that the level of rent assistance more realistically reflects the current level of housing costs;</PARA>
<PARA> - an extension of the boundaries for payment of the remote area allowance; and</PARA>
<PARA> - an increase in the rates, and automatic indexation of, a range of benefits and allowances for severely disabled veterans including allowances for specific injuries and disabilities, recreation transport allowance and clothing allowance. The rates of these allowances will be increased from 20 September 1990 and will, in future, be increased automatically in line with movements in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to those provisions of the Bill which would give effect to a number of undertakings by the Government to improve entitlements of veterans and dependants. The first of these relates to the automatic granting of war widows' pension to the widows of veterans who were in receipt of, or were entitled to receive, extreme disablement adjustment at the time of their death. The widows and dependants of these veterans would be entitled to the same benefits as the widows of special rate pensioners. These changes will be backdated to 22 December 1988, being the date on which the extreme disablement allowance was introduced, and will provide for similar benefits to all severely disabled veterans and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most extensive changes for veterans and dependants, in terms of responding to the changing needs of an ageing veteran population, is the proposal to extend the purposes for which loans may be made under the Defence Service Homes Act. This extension will make it possible to provide assistance for persons seeking accommodation in retirement villages in which they will have a permanent right of residence. This change represents a significant step towards meeting the housing needs of older veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will also provide increased flexibility for the 140,000 holders of defence service home loans outstanding at 9 December 1987, by allowing these borrowers to transfer their loans from one home to another. This initiative replaces existing limited arrangements for transfers of loans. An associated amendment also brings to an end the possibility of eligible persons losing their benefits through the transfer of a loan to an ineligible person. </PARA>
<PARA> As the defence service homes initiatives represent an extension of the lending business sold to the Westpac Banking Corporation in November 1988, the bank has agreed to purchase the rights to the new lending business. The supplementary agreement with Westpac forms schedule 1 to this Bill. It is expected that the new arrangements will assist up to 3,000 persons. This will result in Westpac paying to the Commonwealth each year more than $1m in fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the automatic grant of war widows' pension to veterans receiving extreme disablement adjustment will cost an estimated $0.11m in 1990-91 and $0.24m in 1991-92. The provisions to deem income on cash and deposits and the changes to the rent assistance threshold are expected to result in savings of $3.516m in 1990-91 and $15.331m in 1991-92. The proposal to allow portability for defence service homes loans is expected to result in net costs of $0.131m in 1990-91 and $2.015m in 1991-92. </PARA>

<PARA> I point out to the honourable member for Chifley that comrade Kirner in the bankrupt State of Victoria last month imposed on Victorians-better known as Mexicans-an iniquitous 3c a litre surcharge on petrol to support payment to those people who invested in the Pyramid Building Society who lost their money as a result of statements made in public by the then Treasurer of the State of Victoria, the Hon. Rob Jolly. In New South Wales a tax is imposed on all citizens in order to produce further good works. In Victoria a tax is imposed on that section of the public who drive motor vehicles-all the transport operators, all the users of petrol-in order to support those people in the community who invested their money in a building society because they believed that they would obtain high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Had it not been for the fact that the Treasurer of Victoria messed it all up and managed to convince the citizens of Victoria that their money was safe in Pyramid without investigating the facts of the case, without knowing whether or not Pyramid was safe, without knowing whether the investors' deposits were secure, this surcharge would never have been imposed. The surcharge, of course, relates only to those people who use petrol. </PARA>
<PARA> Does it make logical sense that those people who use petrol in Victoria now support those who invested their money in the Pyramid Building Society? I would contend that it makes no logical sense whatsoever. I agree that the Government of Victoria made a case to the people that the Society was secure. For that reason, the Government has some responsibility to the people, which it is attempting to discharge by guaranteeing payment on a dollar-for-dollar basis some time in the distant future, which we are led to believe will be long after a Liberal government is in control of the State of Victoria. An act by the then Treasurer of the State of Victoria will create pain into the future for all citizens of Victoria, and I hope the people of this country never forget that act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am certain that the citizens of New South Wales will never want to move to the State of Victoria. I think they would revel in the fact that they have an honest government in New South Wales which is delivering a positive response to the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak this evening about a matter that is of some concern in Western Australia. It relates to a court case which has been a recent source of much media coverage in the State in the past few weeks. In the end it resulted in the conviction of Robert Martin and Robert Smith for telephone bugging pursuant to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and, in particular, some allegations during the trial that senior members of the Western Australian Government knew of or may have organised such interception that was the subject of this particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I would like to talk about the background to the case. The matter arose as a result of the charging of the Chairman of the Superannuation Board, Mr Len Brush, in 1987 for allegedly receiving $150,000 as a loan in return for favours to Mr Robert Martin in relation to some investments and a project called the Anchorage Project which was to be constructed in north Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA> At the trial Mr Brush was acquitted. Pursuant to that trial in 1988 allegations that telephone tapping had taken place during the course of the inquiries leading to the trial became public knowledge and, as a consequence, investigations were carried out. The investigations resulted in the charging of Robert Smith and Robert Martin for telephone bugging. As I said earlier, they were eventually convicted last week. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter is of interest because of a diary that was seized from Mr Robert Smith. Mr Smith was a police officer in the 1970s in the Western Australian drug squad. He left the force and formed his own private investigation firm. During this particular period in 1987 he was hired to conduct some telephone interceptions, in particular on a key witness in the matter of the case of Len Brush. </PARA>
<PARA> During the trial some entries in the diary came to the fore and, in particular, the following entries were mentioned in cross examination. These were entries of a running sheet of the activities of the Robert Smith investigation agency and referred to the following: 14 April 1987, work on Lightfoot for BB, 1.5 hours; 15 April, work on Lightfoot for BB, instigate inquiries in eastern States; 21 April, work for BB on Lightfoot, 1 p.m. to 6 p.m.; 22 April, work on Lightfoot, Briggs, Aust. Shale, PRL Nominees, Southern Goldfields and Medico, Blue Downs, for BB; 28 April, work on Lightfoot, Southern Goldfields etc, five hours plus John three hours, Kathy one hour, note to BB re Illich, Applicant SSB-which presumably stood for the State Superannuation Board; 29 April, Vince rang-bombshell on bloke-to call that office, work on Lightfoot, 11 p.m., called to Martin's by wife; 30 April, sweep on R. Martin's house, two hours; 4 May, spoke with Vince, pressure on, wants something on Lightfoot; 7 May, BB, Lightfoot, four hours; 9 May, documents re Lightfoot to BB; 11 May, further checks re Lightfoot for BB; 15 May, four hours, BB, Laurence, Lightfoot; 19 May, BB back, note to BB re lightfoot, 3.5 hours; 20 May, saw Vince; 21 May, saw Vince; 23 May, Vince rang before departure to Canberra, boss wants Laurence, go slow on Lightfoot; 26 May, accounts to Darcy Farrell. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for the importance of this particular use of BB was that there was some belief in that particular trial that the initials BB may have stood for the former Premier, Brian Burke. The person that is referred to as Vince is believed to have been Vince Shervington who was Brian Burke's personal driver and also the person who organises things to do with his office and to do with his trips to various other States, et cetera. He was Premier Burke's driver and services officer, as described in the trial. Darcy Farrell was Mr Burke's press officer. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I have raised this matter is that I believe that the reference to BB, which may have been the Premier at the time, Brian Burke, who is now the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See, requires a thorough investigation by the relevant authorities to ensure that all matters relating to these particular telecommunication charges and convictions are properly investigated. As such, it would satisfy members of the public in particular in Western Australia that the ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See either was or was not involved in securing the services of Mr Robert Smith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the issue of unemployment. I have had some major concerns in recent weeks about the way that the issue of unemployment figures has been presented and discussed in this House. I am probably most concerned about the fact that we keep referring to the 1982-83 figures as a comparison. One has to remember that during that period this country had a major drought. It concerns me that when we have looked at the unemployment figures we really have not been taking into account the effect of the major increases in the Public Service numbers over recent years. There are a number of other major areas that need to be taken into consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned when we look at companies, particularly companies in my electorate, and at the types of problems that they are addressing and the factors that influence the unemployment issues. I have many companies in my electorate which have been sending people on long service leave to try to resolve their unemployment problem, or what would become an unemployment problem. These same people are sending employees on annual leave. A number of them are working on a four-day week, and in many cases, three day weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a concerning factor when we go through factories in the electorate and find on a Thursday or Friday that we could fire a bullet through them because these people are not physically working. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) would come into this place and consistently say that the unemployment figures are not in the same order as they were in 1982-83. He is right, if we want to look at the figures that are calculated by the boffins in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need to get the Treasurer and a few of the other Ministers from this Government out to the electorates, out into the real world, to have a look at the real figures and the real problems that are facing these businesses. The real difficulties that we face are not the statistical figures that are here but the basis that the businesses are trying to work on. They are trying to survive in very difficult times. I really do not care whether the Treasurer decides that we have technical recessions or we do not have a recession, or whatever. He needs to realise that he and I and everyone else in this place are representatives of people. We are here to represent them and take care of the interests of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned when I go out into my electorate and talk to businesses. They keep asking me what is happening in that place, Canberra. These people do not seem to understand the problems that we have. Our unemployment figures at the moment are not reflecting the true problems that we have. Not too far down the track we will see that the long service leave of these people will run out. We will see that the companies will not be able to contribute to the holiday pays on a continual basis. We will see that the factories working three days a week will not be able to continue to do that. We will see these unemployment figures rise. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is high time that the Treasurer, while he has the opportunity to do so, got out into the electorate. I would happily invite him out into my electorate to see the types of problems that these businesses are facing. Many of these businesses are in a situation at the moment where they cannot afford to put people off because of the redundancy packages. They will get to the stage where they wind out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> If that is what we want for the businesses and the people who can provide the basis to resolve the problems that we have in this country, I believe it is a sad and sorrowful mark on the government of the day. We have around 650,000 small businesses. Those businesses can solve many of our unemployment problems and replace many of the imports that come into this country, but there is only one way they can do it; that is, to be given some sort of incentive, some sort of encouragement, if you like, from the Government. That is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that some of the Ministers in this Government must get out and see the people. It is high time that they looked at the real problems on the ground rather than sitting here and looking at the statistical information that flows through this place. That is just not good enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the time. My contribution will be very short. This afternoon during the 90-second statements, I made a comment in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I will quickly clarify the matter as I ran out of time earlier. At the end of my speech I said that it was important for the Government to look very seriously at this question as the convention does have very strong statements. After that I wanted to say that there are strong statements about the rights of parents to raise their children unfettered by the state, except in the case of physical and mental abuse. Articles 12, 13 and 15 especially, and also articles 14 and 16, must have firm statements that the rights of children are subject to parental control.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) talk about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. On a number of occasions many of us on this side of the House have expressed some very real concerns about the Government's intention to ratify a convention which, in the view of many of us, seriously undermines the rights and, indeed, the responsibilities of parents in respect of the correct upbringing of their children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that last night the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), on the other side of the chamber, also drew the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to his concerns about the United Nations convention. Significantly the honourable member for Herbert pointed out that there had been a misconception about the intention of the Vatican or the Pope in regard to the United Nations convention because we had been told by the Attorney-General in this House that the Catholic Church actually supported that convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert clearly pointed out last night that this was not the case and that the Vatican had only intended to ratify the United Nations convention with some very serious reservations. Significantly, one reservation was that the convention was deficient in spelling out very clearly the rights and responsibilities that parents have to bring up their children as they see fit. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Ballarat just brought that matter to my attention. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining time I have, I draw attention to a question that was asked earlier in the House today. In Question Time today, the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) asked the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) about the closing down of the science faculty at Bond University. The Minister in his answer acknowledged that he knew that the science faculty at Bond University was to be closed down and he said that he was sorry-or words to that effect- and that he was disappointed that that had been the case. He said that he supported the work of Bond University and realised that the work of the science faculty, particularly its research into the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and other scientific areas, was very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard that answer as being totally inadequate; in fact, I think the Minister's answer was totally hollow. From day one this Government has given no encouragement whatsoever to Bond University. From a philosophical point of view, I think the Government will be very happy not only to see the science faculty at Bond University close down, but also every other faculty as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This fine institution, which I point out is in my electorate, is going from strength to strength. Already, some graduates of the university's faculties, particularly its business faculties, have come onto the marketplace and have been in demand. Bond University is producing some very fine graduates. Its law faculty is rapidly becoming one of the most desirable faculties in the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very concerned that the Minister, in his answer to the question about the closure of the science faculty at Bond University, implied that the backers of the university in fact were responsible. He acknowledged that the science faculty had a considerable amount of support from private industry-and it does. I think it is Burroughs-Welcome that has guaranteed up until this point in time $4.5m over three years to support the faculty. But there was a deficiency, and the Minister, in his answer to the question, implied that the backers of the university ought to pick that up. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that is unfortunate, because the Japanese partner, EIE, in the absence of Mr Bond through his problems-and he has done nothing much to help the cause-has been putting in $500,000 a week until now to keep that particular university going. I applaud that activity and suggest that the Minister's answer to the question this afternoon in saying that he was disappointed that the science faculty was to close down was totally hollow. He shed real crocodile tears. If he and the Government are serious about Bond University as a private tertiary institution, they ought to be encouraging and be seen to encourage that university. It is the first of a number of private tertiary educational institutions that will appear in this country, and we on this side applaud and support that particular thrust. We certainly support Bond University. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to conclude briefly the remarks I made earlier in relation to an important trial that took place recently in Western Australia in which two men were convicted of telephone bugging pursuant to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the revelations during that trial that related to a running sheet that was put together by Robert Smith, the investigator who was hired to make these telephone buggings, for which he was convicted. Of course, I mentioned and read parts of an excerpt from the trial transcript that was reported in the West Australian, in which there were references to the running sheet or diary that was seized by police that related to a person called BB.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to honourable members that during the trial the defendant Smith was in fact asked who BB was or who it referred to, and he said that it referred to Robert Martin, who was his co-defendant. It was pointed out to him that in fact he referred to Robert Martin, using his full name, in other parts of the running sheet, and that may have given the lie to that particular comment. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to the Federal Government, in answer to a question without notice in the Senate concerning the investigation relating to this particular matter, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has given a commitment that the matter will be properly investigated as soon as possible and that the Parliament will be advised. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the matter purely and simply because it is a matter of great concern to many people throughout Australia and, in particular, to many of the citizens of Western Australia, who have seen a veritable collection of incidents during the last few years involving the Western Australian Government and certain business dealings in which it has been involved that have given rise to considerable concern. Of course, there have been many calls throughout the community for a royal commission or a full and proper inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the relationship between the initials BB and the running sheet, the person named as Vince Shervington, who was the driver to the then Premier Brian Burke, other allegations and matters that arose during that trial concerning some tapes relating to telephone interceptions and other ancillary matters that arose as a result of this particular trial, really do call for a proper investigation that, surely, must involve at least inquiries of the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See. </PARA>
<PARA> One would presume that, in conducting a full and proper inquiry, the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See would at least return to Australia at some time to cooperate and assist the authorities conducting that inquiry with their inquiries and, to that end, hopefully satisfy those people within the community, particularly in Western Australia, as to whether the private investigator, Robert Smith, was hired by somebody senior in the Western Australian Government and whether that person was the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy See and the former Premier, Brian Burke. </PARA>

<PARA> Particular purpose grants were made to individuals, community groups, voluntary conservation organisations and local governments between 1982-83 and 1988-89 to develop demonstration projects. The National Tree Program (NTP) was amalgamated with the One Billion Trees Program in 1989-90. Between 1982-83 and 1987-88 NTP Coordinating Committees in each State and Territory were responsible for decisions relating to grants and details of the grants are not readily available. In 1988-89 Greening Australia Limited organisations in each State and Territory became responsible for administering the scheme of grants. Total allocations for grants for demonstration projects under the NTP, which would include grants to conservation groups, were:</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3701" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FRASER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Table 1 attached provides annual figures on the net public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and the current account deficit (CAD) in absolute terms and relative to GDP, for the period from 1965-66 to 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A close relationship between the net PSBR and the CAD from one year to another is not to be expected since the CAD reflects not only public sector net borrowing but also private sector net borrowing (ie the balance between private saving and private investment). Over longer periods there is an observable tendency for significant movements in public sector net borrowing to be reflected in movements in the current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of historical developments in the net PSBR, private sector net lending and the CAD is provided in pages 2.50-53 of this year's Budget Statement 2. The main points are:</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1960s and early 1970s, private investment was reasonably close to private saving so that on average the private sector was in approximate financial balance. There was a persistent net PSBR and CAD, although both were reasonably small relative to GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> The net PSBR increased sharply in 1974-75-because of a boost to public spending-and remained high in most years up to 1986-87, averaging 4.9 per cent of GDP over this period. For a while, the effect of this structural deterioration in the net PSBR was not reflected in a marked rise in the CAD because of the historically unusual situation of the private sector being a net lender over most of the 1970s-private saving was high and investment low.</PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1980s, despite some reduction in the net PSBR, the CAD rose sharply, reflecting the private sector investment boom in the resources sector. In the 1982-83 recession, private investment fell more than private saving and, despite some increase in the net PSBR, there was a temporary decline in the CAD. As the economy recovered from the recession and the private sector returned to financial balance, higher net PSBRs were again reflected in higher CADs.</PARA>
<PARA> The period since 1985-86 has been one of substantial fiscal consolidation, reflecting mainly reductions in public consumption and a consequent rise in public saving. This contributed to a reduction in the CAD in 1986-87 and 1987-88, but was then increasingly offset by a sharp rise in private investment. It was only in the latter part of 1989-90, as the surge in private investment eased, that the CAD began to decline.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) These developments imply that a significant and sustained reduction in public sector net borrowing (or a move to a public sector financial surplus) is likely, over time, to be reflected in a lower current account deficit. However, this need not be the case in the short-term, because of cyclical movements in private sector net borrowing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Aggregate lending $US21.4 billion (commitments)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Aggregate payments $US14.9 billion (gross disbursements)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Interest and charges $US6.9 billion</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Net disbursements $US5.3 billion</PARA>
<PARA>Net transfers were negative $US1,547 million in 1988-89 and (positive) $US2,413 million in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As the World Bank only lends to developing countries, the answer to this question is the same as question 1.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The World Bank lends to developing countries through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and to the poorer developing countries (per capita income less then $US480 p.a.) through the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional lending arm of the World Bank. There are no interest charges on the credits provided to these countries by IDA. Net transfers from IDA were $US3,126 million in 1988-89 and $US3,363 million in 1989-90. The funds used by IDA come mostly in the form of subscriptions, general replenishments from IDA's more industrialised and developed members and from transfers from the net earnings of the IBRD.</PARA>
<PARA> Both IBRD net disbursements and net transfers have been reduced in recent years by the voluntary action of various IBRD borrowers in prepaying loans. These prepayments totalled $US2.5 billion in 1988-89 and $US0.6 billion in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also wide variation among countries in the direction and volume of net transfers vis-a-vis IBRD. Some are receiving positive transfers, reflecting significant growth of new lending. In others new lending has stabilised or fallen for various reasons (e.g. progress towards graduation of loans, lack of desire to borrow, inappropriate domestic policy settings) and net transfers have been negative. For the 48 currently active IBRD borrowers, net transfers were close to zero in 1989-90; excluding prepayments, they were positive $US375 million.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that positive net transfers from IBRD to its borrowers would be difficult to sustain year in year out. For this to happen, borrowers' debt to IBRD would have to keep expanding at a rate above the rate of interest on their existing IBRD debt (currently about 8 per cent per annum). This would be in excess of the recent growth rate of developing country GNP in dollar terms. Hence, in these conditions, maintenance of positive net transfers would require inexorable growth of debt service burdens, which are already unmanageable in many countries. The IBRD believes this would be unhealthy for both the borrowers and itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes data only on the maturity structure of foreign debt domiciled abroad (that is, debt issued overseas by Australian residents).</PARA>
<PARA> Non-resident acquisitions of debt instruments issued in Australia such as Commonwealth government securities are excluded.</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign debt domiciled abroad is separated into official and non-official categories on an annual basis. The official sector consists of general government and Reserve Bank debt. Public trading and financial enterprise debt is included with private debt in the non-official sector.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 (the latest year available), of the stock of debt held by the official sector, 10.6 per cent was contractually due or expected to be repaid within a year. The remainder (89.4 per cent), was contractually due or expected to be repaid over periods longer than one year. The corresponding figures for the non-official sector are 37.5 per cent and 60.2 per cent, respectively (with 2.3 per cent unable to be allocated to a particular maturity profile).</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr Tickner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) In May 1982, following the High Court decision mentioned by Mr Hollis, the then Queensland Government declared the Archer River property, which the Commonwealth had sought to acquire and transfer to Aboriginal ownership, a State national park. The property has remained a national park since that time under a management which has given very limited access to Aboriginal people associated with that land.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government, I am advised, has employed a consultant to investigate ways in which the interests of the Winychanam people, and especially those of Mr John Koowarta, can be addressed. These complex negotiations, which have the support of the Queensland Premier and the Minister for Environment and Heritage, Mr Pat Comben, are expected to last for several more months. I am advised that the Queensland Government believes that it may be in a position to make an announcement on the issue of the Archer River property (now Archer Bend National Park) early in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) With respect to the High Court decision on the Western Australia Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 that the Crown was bound under that Act, this House will be aware from statements made by my predecessor that following high level discussions in mid 1989 the then Premier of Western Australia agreed that the State would henceforth operate as though it was bound by its own Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The wider implications of the High Court decision are essentially matters for the Attorney-General and for State and Territory Governments to consider.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As arrangements for the private use of Commonwealth vehicles apply to officers employed under the Public Service Act, all Federal Government departments may advertise positions with the use of a car as part of the remuneration package.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are currently approximately 2000 cars involved. A further 59 are on order.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The following principal criteria apply to the use of cars as part of a remuneration package:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) participating officers must occupy offices in the Senior Executive Service of the APS, normally on a substantive basis, or occupy equivalent offices in statutory authorities staffed under the Public Service Act. However, given the incidence of long-term actual occupancy of SES positions in many departments, there appears to be scope to consider the extension of the option for the use of privately-plated vehicles to officers acting long-term;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) participation is subject to the officer making a personal contribution to his/her agency, payable fortnightly, equivalent to $700 per annum for a six cylinder vehicle and $500 per annum for a four cylinder vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) participants should have a limited choice of type of car.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) accessories may be fitted to a vehicle at the request of an officer following approval of the agency. The cost must, however, be borne by the officer. Any accessories must conform to relevant standards and must not detract from the vehicle's potential resale value.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) existing general rules and arrangements apply concerning such matters as accident reporting, liability and damages, unfair wear and tear, traffic offences.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The following restrictions apply to the use of Commonwealth vehicles for private use, including outside business hours.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the vehicle is to be driven only by the officer and his/her nominees when used for private purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) workers compensation cover does not apply while an officer is travelling on private business. That is, an officer is only covered while travelling on Commonwealth business, such as to and from his/her place of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the vehicle must be made available by the officer during office hours for use by other staff, as required.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) private use of a vehicle for interstate travel and normal periods of leave must be approved by the head of each agency.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) if an officer is authorised to take a vehicle on leave, the personal financial contribution will continue and the officer will be responsible for fuel charges and any extra servicing costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) With few exceptions, vehicles allocated for private use have normal number plates. All participating officers are eligible to have access to privately plated Commonwealth owned vehicles. The vehicles are privately registered and conform with relevant standards.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No precise figures are available on the effect that the inclusion of self-drive vehicles in remuneration packages has had on Comcar's car with driver operations. Total revenue has fallen recently, but this is attributable to several factors as well as the use of self-drive cars by SES officers, i.e. the airline dispute, the increased use of Cab-charge by public servants and the reduction in sitting times by Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA> Did the Minister announce on 13 June 1990 the Government's decision to accede to the 1950 ``Florence'' Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials and the 1976 ``Nairobi'' Protocol to the Agreement; if so, what is the timetable for depositing the instruments of accession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes. A Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce-Australian Customs Service Working Party is preparing a Submission detailing the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 which will be required to implement the Government's decision to accede to the Florence Agreement and the Nairobi Protocol. This Submission will be considered by the Government later this year. It is therefore likely that the necessary tariff amendment legislation will be enacted in the Autumn sittings of 1991. Assuming clear passage of this legislation, the necessary tariff amendments will take effect from 1 July 1991. Australia will then be in a position to deposit instruments of accession with UNESCO.</PARA>
