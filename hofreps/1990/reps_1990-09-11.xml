<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise under standing order 95 to bring to the attention of the House a matter of privilege. The matter concerns two articles dealing with the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. One article is by Martin Daly in the Melbourne Sunday Herald on 9 September and is headed `Migrant Amnesty Proposals Give Hope to 20,000'. The other article is by Michael Millett in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, 10 September, and is headed `Call to Ease Law on Illegal Migrants'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Practice at page 713 states that the evidence taken by any select committee and documents presented to and proceedings and reports of such committees which have not been reported to the House shall not, unless authorised by the House, be disclosed or published by any committee member or by any other persons. It is clear to me that both articles reveal either that the authors have seen confidential draft reports of the Committee or have been informed of the private deliberations of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> In the time since the articles were published, and given that the Committee has been finalising its report for presentation today, I have not been able to establish the sources of these articles. As a result of the articles, serious concern has been created in the community and false expectations have been created in relation to the possibilities of an amnesty which, as honourable members will see when the report is presented later today, is misleading and a misrepresentation of the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the matter for your consideration now, Mr Speaker, because I am extremely concerned that the Committee's private deliberations and/or its draft report have not been kept confidential. I understand that under the Standing Orders matters of privilege must be raised at the first opportunity. The Melbourne Sunday Herald is published by Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, Flinders Street, Melbourne, and the Sydney Morning Herald by John Fairfax and Sons of Jones Street, Broadway. </PARA>
<PARA> I present copies of the articles in question and I ask you, Mr Speaker, to consider giving precedence to a motion so that the issue can be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges for investigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to his assertion last Sunday that `I really know how to run this and lead this Labor Party. I just operate quietly behind the scenes'. Can the Prime Minister, therefore, inform the House why he has so continuously lent public support to the Beazley megacom option while acknowledging in the Cabinet room that it is an inferior proposal?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1533" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have made no apology at any stage of this ongoing debate for the processes that have been employed within the Australian Labor Party. We have been the party in government which has been prepared to tackle the very difficult issues of micro-economic reform. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that my challenge, made at the time of the last election, remains unanswered. I asked him or anyone behind or around him then to nominate any period of conservative government which came within a bull's roar of the record of achievement in micro-economic reform of this Government. That challenge remains unanswered because it is unanswerable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this process of undertaking what the conservatives never had the guts to do we have been prepared within our Party to undertake open discussion. When we talked about an issue such as introducing competition into the area of telecommunications, it was inevitable that there were going to be deep feelings and differences of opinion within our Party. I said appropriately the other day that I had my way of leading this Party, and I guess that in the end I would say to honourable members opposite, including the present Leader and the other two behind him whom I have met and dealt with, that the record of leadership of the Labor Party since 1983 is best tested by looking at who has got the runs on the board.</PARA>
<PARA> I have continued in that way on this important issue. I have encouraged debate and discussion and I have recognised, as Minister Beazley has recognised, the indisputable fact that no-one can assert that any particular model has 100 per cent of all the benefits and lacks all of the disadvantages.</PARA>
<PARA> There are certain features of competition based on an OTC model which have their attractions and to which I have referred. Let me say that there would also be distinct costs in using OTC. The bene- fits of OTC are based on OTC's know- ledge of the Australian market. But the important thing to notice under the proposal that the Cabinet has now endorsed is that OTC will not be lost to the Australian people; its values and its skills will be retained in public ownership and it will remain a highly competitive force in one of the most important markets for telecommunications, and that is of course our link with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> Also, it should be understood that it will serve another invaluable purpose, and that is as an incentive to Telecom to get its interconnect operation done right and get it done soon. All overseas experience, particularly in the United States, if I may say so, shows the desperate need for an incumbent monopolist to have a stake in getting competition started. OTC will certainly be that stake for Telecom. Those are the considerations that I regard as relevant to the question that has been asked by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say in conclusion that the hypocrisy of the approach of the Leader of the Opposition on this matter is mind-boggling. We understand that what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting is that if one has an unqualified view as to what is the right policy position the responsibility of leadership is to push that and to push it despite the pressures one may face. I have answered in this case why we have taken the position we have in regard to Telecom. For this man opposite, this Leader of the Opposition, to adopt this position is the height of hypocrisy. In this place I have indicated what the clear position of the Leader of the Opposition was, when he was an untainted academic, on a fundamental issue of policy-taxation. He was asked on 3 August 1987 what his position was on capital gains and fringe benefits taxes. What he had to say then-and this is the Leader of the Opposition who asks that leadership be followed through-was this: `I'd go for near uniform taxation of all forms of income'.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, before the bully boys of the Liberal Party, the ones behind the scenes who have got the power and tell the leaders what to do, had got at him he had a clear and unequivocal view of what the responsibility was in this matter; that is, that he would tax capital gains the same as income tax. When it gets to the position of leadership, when he is there and has the opportunity to give leadership on a fundamental issue of taxation, what does he do? When the bully boys of the Liberal Party say `No capital gains tax', this Leader says, `Yes, sir, no capital gains tax'. It did not come too difficult for him because, as a man of considerable holdings of real property and personal property, it was very convenient to forget what he had thought was the real position.</PARA>
<PARA> So do not let this Leader of the Opposition talk about the responsibility of leadership. On a fundamental issue of taxation reform, when he knew what the right position was, instead of providing his Party with leadership, he turned around to the bully boys of the Liberal Party and said, `Okay, if there is to be no capital gains tax I will lie down'. He lay down and in so doing he forfeited any claim to decent leadership and to having any integrity whatsoever.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1535" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government and, I believe, the people of Australia, I welcome wholeheartedly the agreement reached by the Cambodian factions in Jakarta last night to accept the United Nations Security Council framework for peace in Indo-China. I trust that, in expressing that welcome on behalf of the Government, I am speaking for all members of this House because that decision taken in Jakarta last night represents the greatest opportunity yet for an end to what has been this continuing saga of tragedy, conflict and suffering of the Cambodian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last night the Cambodian parties agreed, firstly, on the formation of a supreme national council, the SNC, and, importantly, that that SNC will embody the sovereignty of Cambodia. Secondly, the SNC will occupy the Cambodian seat at the United Nations and, most importantly for current purposes, the SNC will delegate to the United Nations all the powers necessary to implement a comprehensive peace agreement, including the conduct of free and fair elections and the general administration of Cambodia. It is quite clear, now that this major decision has been made and agreement reached to this point, that a considerable amount of detail and much hard work remains to be done in order to bring the process to ultimate fruition. But there is no doubt that the Jakarta meeting and the decision made there are crucial for this further process to go forward.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not automatically committed to the deployment of Australian forces as part of the United Nations role that will be involved, but I have indicated previously, and I do so again, that Australia will be prepared to make a major contribution to a United Nations presence in Cambodia in the transitional period which is envisaged under that decision. Of course, the size and nature of that contribution will depend on the United Nations requirements as determined by the Secretary-General and the provisions of the final settlement.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I trust that all honourable members-not only those on this side of the House-will join me in applauding the magnificent contribution that has been made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans. Senator Evans took the initiative on this issue and there is a universal recognition by all participants in this process-not only by those directly involved in Cambodia but by the other nations; the Association of South East Asian Nations, the European nations, the United States and the permanent five-that the permanent five framework which was adopted at the Jakarta meeting last night is based upon the work put forward by Australia through its Foreign Minister. Therefore, the whole of Australia, irrespective of people's political affiliations, should join, with great joy, in applauding the magnificent work that has been done by Australia's Foreign Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> That initiative and concept which flowed from the Australian Foreign Minister has been given effect to by the tremendous work undertaken by officials of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Many of those officials have been involved in the hard slogging, shuttle diplomacy within Asia, Europe, the United States and the United Nations. I pay tribute to them all but most particularly to the work done by Mr Michael Costello.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Treasurer. By way of background, the Treasurer would have seen in the report on mobile telephones by the Australian Telecommunications Authority, Austel, its view that where there is a duopoly of only two competitors in a market, monopoly prices are still charged, no real choice is offered to the consumer and there is no incentive to adopt new technologies and minimise costs. The Treasurer would also have seen that Austel then argued that more competitors produce greater benefits in terms of efficiency, price, product and service. In the light of that, I ask the Treasurer: Is Austel right on its economic arguments against duopolies and in favour of greater competition? If so, why is the Australian economy not to get the full benefits of competition in telecommunications?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has not reached a final conclusion on the particular recommendations of Austel, so one cannot be clear as to what competitive outcomes are likely to emerge until that decision has been made. As to the more general point about duopolies and competition, we could have a debate here all afternoon about that. We could perhaps start by the coalition telling us why it was so happy to sit with monopolies, let alone duopolies, for years particularly in telecommunications and why it was so keen to re-establish a duopoly in airlines just before the 1983 election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister for Land Transport meet with his State and Territory transport colleagues in Hobart on 7 September 1990? Was consideration given to the establishment of a national rail freight corporation? What was the result of these discussions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1536" SPEAKER="Brown The Hon R.J." NAMEID="5A5" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CHARLTON" MINISTERIAL="LAND TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the question is yes, I did meet last Friday in Hobart with the State transport Ministers. The propositions that were put before the State transport Ministers probably represented some of the most substantial proposals that State transport Ministers have ever given consideration to. One of those, as indicated by the question asked by the honourable member for Port Adelaide, is the question of the proposed national rail freight corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was delighted with the way in which the State Ministers responded, although they have from time to time indicated some degrees of concern-and some of those are continuing. I have assured them their concerns will be resolved in the process of negotiations and the discussions which will take place as a result of the decision to establish a task force of officials from both the Federal Government and each of the State governments. The task force will be appointed under an independent chairman to ensure that each of the States can be satisfied that it will be able to participate appropriately.</PARA>
<PARA> The intention is that we try to get as many of the principles together for the proposed national rail freight corporation by the end of this year. We will then call a special meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council, consisting of both the State transport Ministers and me, at the end of January to give further consideration to the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to emphasise this point: I said that it was one of the most important propositions taken before State transport Ministers since Federation-probably in the last 100 years, as the Leader of the National Party would concede because of his own interest in the development of rail. It has been estimated that if we were able to get a corporation of the kind suggested up and running and we required it to operate on a very firm, positive, commercial basis, it would be possible for it to make a contribution to Australia's gross domestic product of something like $1.4 billion every year. That would continue year after year.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but if we were able to do it the States and State taxpayers by about 1993-94 would benefit to the extent of something like $375m every year. I think we ignore possibilities of that kind to our peril.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to emphasise something else in connection with this. Some people may have had some reservations about whether rail will be or should be able to compete effectively against road transport at the present time. Because of the particular interest of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in the successful operations of Australian National (AN), I point out that it has just recently declared-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australian National, the Commonwealth Government railway system, as you know, Mr Speaker, just announced a profit for the last financial year in excess of $8m. On its freight division last year there was a profit of $11m. That compares with $9m the year before and represents the fourth consecutive year in which AN has made a profit on the interstate freight movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only State system which has been able to do that is the Western Australian system. It made a profit of about $2m last year. So it indicates that rail can become competitive. If we approach it commercially, if we get together systems of the kind we need, we will be able to operate rail commercially with benefits to State taxpayers and the national economy of the dimensions that I have indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> The deficit on AN's passenger services was reduced by something approaching $3m with the result that the annual deficit now is substantially lower than it was before. It was hoped that it would be able to cut even on Tasrail's operations. I am sure it is of particular interest to those honourable members who come from Tasmania that the deficit the previous year was about $4m; last year it made a profit of $60,000. I know that is not very substantial, but it indicates very clearly and positively that if we are prepared to take the initiatives that are obviously necessary in connection with rail, then we can get rail to a position where it will be able to satisfy and fulfil the types of requirements that should be made for rail. That is important for Australia. It is important to the effectiveness and success with which the whole land transport system can operate. I appreciate the question and I understand the honourable member's interest in it because he represents that industry and those people very well.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. It is asked in token of the Prime Minister's great affection for political history in this country. I remind the Prime Minister that the special national conference of his Party on privatisation is to be held almost five years to the day after his own inaugural `Light on the Hill' oration at Bathurst in September 1985 when he exhorted his Party members to keep fresh and green the memory, the example and the experience of the late Ben Chifley by totally opposing the then policies of the Opposition to privatise, in whole or in part, Australian Airlines, Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank and Telecom. Now that the Prime Minister has been forced to accept, however inadequately, the essential logic of what the Liberal and National parties asserted at least five years ago, how does he justify to the Australian people his blatant political opportunism then and also the lost opportunity over the last five years to bring about major structural changes with bipartisan support in areas which he will undoubtedly tell his Party's conference in two weeks time must be tackled if the government is to have a remotely credible micro-economic reform agenda?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I preface my remarks by expressing the hope that he does not think that history began just five years ago. If we are going to have an historical exercise, let us have a brief one. If we started our historical exercise in 1949, we would come to the conclusion that between 1949 and 1990 the honourable gentleman and his--</PARA></TALK.START>

For the greater part of the period since 1949 he and his mob have been sitting on this side of the chamber, with the responsibility for running this country and undertaking any degree of micro-economic reform his Party thought was necessary. In the whole of that period his Party's record was zilch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member mentioned airlines. Who was the initiator of the duopoly in the airlines industry? Who fought all the way through to keep that duopoly, a licence to print money for one? It was those opposite. In all that period when the honourable member for Bennelong was the Treasurer and had the opportunity to do something about the airline industry, he protected that duopoly. He did not change his thinking at all, he did not develop; he sat there rooted in the conviction that no change was required to what had been done by his predecessors since 1949. In that whole seven-year period when the honourable member's Party was in office, including the time when his Party had control of the Senate, when he could have undertaken any micro-economic reform he wanted in this country, his record was appalling. He did nothing. I have not just stayed rooted in one position.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many philosophers say that the mark of a hopeless individual is that that person is not prepared to develop his thinking. I stand before this House and openly acknowledge that in the period since I have been Prime Minister, when I have had the responsibility of leading this country and facing up to the challenges of the 1980s and 1990s, I have understood that some of the positions and the attitudes of the past are not appropriate to the challenges of today and tomorrow. I have been prepared to change my thinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not stand before this House and apologise for the fact that I understand that, as we go into the final decade of the twentieth century, the attitudes and the assumptions that were formulated 20 or 30 years ago are not the most appropriate. I stand here before this House and say, as I have said publicly elsewhere, that it is necessary to change our thinking to meet the challenges of time. This side of the House has been prepared, as I say, not to stay rooted in the past and claim that what was good enough then is good enough today. Unfortunately, true to their conservative brand, those opposite cannot change their thinking. In relation to the airlines, the waterfront and all the other areas that were crying out for micro-economic reform, they were not prepared to do so. They went through seven years of office and brought in no change.</PARA>
<PARA> We have come to office and faced up to the responsibilities. We have understood that we have had to say to our Party that the positions we have had in the past are not necessarily the right positions for Australia today if we are going to take Australia best equipped into the twenty-first century.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no compunction whatsoever in standing before this House and saying yes, I have developed my thinking and changed my position in certain respects because I believe that the attitudes of the past are not appropriate for the present or the future. I make no apologies for that. The great tragedy is that those who are bound by ideology, those who sit on the other side of the House, neither had the courage in office to change nor have the imagination now to be relevant.</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that when I go before the members of my Party on 24 September they will respond to the challenge that I and my Cabinet colleagues put to them-that we have to be prepared to change. It will not be a matter of apologising and saying that we had a different view before because the precise point I will be putting to them is that the point and the position we had before are not appropriate to the present and that the interests of this country demand change.</PARA>
<PARA> The difference between us will be one of ideology. Our change will be based upon the proposition that we need to have competition in the telecommunications area, including retaining a fully publicly owned telecommunications facility. That will distinguish us from the Opposition. As we go through the period of this Parliament and up to the next election it is a fight that I will be looking forward to having. It will be a fight about which the Government side will say that the proper development of telecommunications in this country, the proper protection of Australian citizens, requires competition and, within a competitive framework, it requires a fully publicly owned internationally and domestically operating telecommunications facility.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that position of reality and responsibility towards the welfare of this country we will be facing ideologues who have no interest in the ordinary people of this country. They will just engage in a $20 billion fire sale to hand over the whole of the telecommunications industry to the private sector. The Opposition will not have any concern for retaining a framework which will look after the interests of ordinary consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> I tell the present Leader of the Opposition, the ex-Leader of the Opposition and the whole of the Opposition that that is a fight that we are looking forward to. We have had our arguments within our Party but when we have finished our position out of the conference it is certain that the Labor Government will be standing for a telecommunications industry in which there is a fully publicly owned telecommunications facility. That will be against the Opposition's position, which will be to flog off the whole of the telecommunications industry to the private sector, which would have one concern and one concern only, that is, the maximisation of private profit. As I said, that is a fight that I am looking forward to; it is a fight we will win.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The question she has put before the House basically draws to our attention the most significant child-care expansion in the history of this country. This year the Commonwealth is spending an extra $75m and over the next three years an additional $400m. In three years time we will be spending twice as much on child-care as we are spending now. This brings quite clearly to the public focus the fact that this Government has implemented its commitment to provide this massive shift in the provision of social infrastructure through child-care. As a result of this unprecedented growth in child-care, aged care, medical and pharmaceuticals, family allowance supplement and employment support, and despite the very tight fiscal conditions that we operate under, this Government has provided that infrastructure for the ordinary family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In child-care we see it exemplified in three particular ways: through accessibility, affordability and, very importantly, equality. By 1995-96 the changes that have been put into place now will mean that there will be a quarter of a million child-care places in Australia. That is more than double what we have now and about three times what we had when this Government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to the question of affordability, we want to make sure that people, no matter what their income as long as they need that child-care, should be able to afford it. Unlike the United States and Britain, where child-care is beyond the reach of normal ordinary working families, in this country child-care will be accessible and affordable. Under the new fee relief arrangements up to 125,000 families will benefit from the more generous fee relief system introduced in this Budget. Their parents will get some help with their fees on incomes up to $56,200 if they have one child in care. From 1 October, for parents who are earning $280 a week now, the fee relief ceiling will be lifted to $370 a week. They will get up to $85 a week for 50 hours of care. From 1 January 1991 parents with children in approved commercial centres will get help with their fees for the first time. I think that is a very important issue of equity.</PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, the Opposition's tax rebate policy would do little but inflate prices in a market where the demand is so strong. It would do very little about supply. In fact, the costs would blow out. That has been shown to be the fact in the United States, for example, where in 1980 the Government spent $956m on its tax rebate for child-care. That blew out to $3.4 billion in 1986, a massive increase in expenditure without really influencing the supply.</PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that the honourable member for Forde has asked this question because she has done a tremendous job over the last couple of months in addressing the very important issue of the extension of fee relief to people with children in commercial care. Very importantly, through a committee representing commercial as well as community interests and unions that she has brought together, she is addressing the issue of quality. The recommendations that the honourable member for Forde is bringing together with the work of that committee show a tremendous spirit of consensus in this area that will certainly in a very short period to come-in a matter of months-start to show benefit in the quality of child-care as well as affordability and accessibility for many thousands of Australian families.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the decision that has been taken would not fit the model that is alleged to have been referred to by Tony Cole, the head of the Industry Commission. We will see when the legislation comes into this place that that is the case. I have no reason to make any further comment on what was said in regard to the first part of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the second part of the question, I am obviously, as would be expected, not going to go into the details of the Cabinet discussion on this matter. I simply say, in elaborating slightly on what I said before, that in the Cabinet, as throughout my Party, there has been detailed discussion, debate and argument. First, what united the Cabinet was the commitment to having an effective, competitive position in the telecommunications industry. Second, we were united in our position that in a competitive framework there should be retained, in full public ownership, a telecommunications facility which operates internationally and domestically.</PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret that in terms of those two considerations which united the Cabinet, there was some difference of view as to how those objectives may best be met. All I can say is that I am totally confident, as one who was engaged fully in that debate and in looking at alternatives, that those two objectives will be totally met. That is, when the legislation is passed Australia will have one of the most competitive telecommunications industries in the world. Having what are now OTC and Telecom combined will not be an aberration but will represent what operates in virtually every other country in the world, where there is one facility operating both the international and domestic aspects of the telecommunications enterprise. There seems to be some misunderstanding in the minds of the members of the Opposition and many commentators that what is being talked about here by having OTC and Telecom together is some sort of an aberration when in fact the truth is that having them separated has been an aberration in terms of international comparison.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I am totally confident that when the legislation is passed, Australia will have the benefit, firstly, of one of the most effectively competitive telecommunications industries in the world, and secondly and importantly, in terms of the Australian tradition that we will continue to defend, a significant part of that effective, competitive telecommunication industry will be a fully publicly-owned facility.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As many honourable members would be aware, transplantation of bone marrow is currently the only curative therapy available for a number of diseases of bone marrow, including severe aplastic anaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia. For many people in need of a bone marrow transplant who have been unable to find a compatible donor among relatives, the only hope had been a search of the Anthony Nolan Register in the United Kingdom. This is not only costly and time consuming, but also offers little hope to many Australians of diverse ethnic background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government therefore announced in the Budget that it would make $700,000 available to assist the establishment of Australia's own bone marrow registry, encouraged by the support that had been shown for the initiative at the June meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council, AHMAC, as well as by the Australian community more generally.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian register will be made up of computer registers of donors in each State and Territory. Where an initial search proves unsuccessful, a search of the national register will be undertaken. In addition, the national register will be the point of contact with international registers for international searches of the Australian register.</PARA>
<PARA> It is presently envisaged that the Red Cross will perform the required tissue typing for the registry, as well as entering records on the computer system, while the States are likely to have responsibility for the recruitment of potential donors. These issues of structure, required funding levels and management of the registry are to be considered by AHMAC at its October meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> I am hopeful that the Australian bone marrow register will begin to be operational by the end of this year. Within a few short years the registry should obtain a large pool of potential donors, making bone marrow transplantation between unrelated Australians a common occurrence. An effective register will not only reduce direct costs on the health care system, but ensure improved survival rates and quality of life for those Australians who are unfortunate enough to require a bone marrow transplant.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the honourable gentleman draws my attention to history, even if it be only this morning's-and the Opposition has been discussing history in this matter for some time-it is clear, as far as telecommunications policy is concerned, that over time the honourable gentleman has been rooted in many positions; not least has been the position that he adopted during the last campaign when he had responsibility for this area. It is worth reminding the honourable member of it at this stage when he talks about what is necessary to deliver lower prices to people. He had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Government has received many representations on these reports and believes a statement is necessary to allay public concern. The Government is committed to maintaining the essential common carrier roles of Telecom and Australia Post. Telecom and Australia Post are great national institutions that will not be put at risk. It is equally important that all Australians, no matter where they live, should have access to national telecommunications and postal services and confidence that they will be provided at reasonable prices. Telecom will remain, as it has been, the national terrestrial common carrier in telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>So far as I know, the ALP is the only party which has now taken a firm decision in favour of competition with Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA>This is during the course of the campaign. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If it were not for the fact that Telecom unions were now clearly a Labor Party front, one would expect them to be honest about this and condemn this ALP position. So far as the Government is concerned, competition in the terminal market is an open question and the Government will consider this in the light of its further consideration of the recommendations of the Davidson Committee report.</PARA>
<PARA>It is one thing to change one's mind when one is in government: it is another thing to change one's mind when one is in opposition. Changing its mind on a few things is something which an intelligent government does when it has to work its way through proposals. Hairy-chested Opposition declarations are a different matter.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His question went to the issue of how the Government would be able to ensure, via regulation or a regulator or whatever, that there would be a capacity to deliver at declining prices. Let me tell him that, unless that is in place, the evidence from elsewhere is that either one of two events will occur: either prices will rise or no competition will take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of systems internationally which are totally deregulated on the sort of contestability model that from time to time the Opposition has put out. They exist in Sweden and they exist in New Zealand. There is no regulator in either case, nor is there regulation, and in neither case is there competition. The simple fact is that barriers to entry in the telecommunications market, if one decides seriously for competition, have to be determined on the basis of government legging that into the system. Anyone who knows anything about telecommunications, as opposed to imposing some Chicago business school theory on it, knows that that is the case. There is essentially no argument within the Government on the fact that that ought to be done and no argument by anyone in telecommunications that that is the only way to go.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as a regulator is concerned, unless there is a regulator in place, as I said, there will be no competition. But the fact that we intend to maintain Telecom in full public ownership in the structure which it has effectively established to this point, with the profit stream that it has and the profit stream that OTC has, with the fact that there is room to manoeuvre within the structure of Telecom's current investment program in its own infrastructure, means that we are able to say with confidence that we can maintain the community service obligations (CSO) of Telecom and that we can maintain the rural program. The Opposition in its position cannot say that. It has not only proposed competition; it has proposed selling the monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the House what happens when that occurs elsewhere. It is such a gigantic step to oblige the capital markets to absorb the real costs of a telephone monopoly-an asset worth something between $15 billion and $20 billion-that it becomes the Opposition's preoccupation. It was the preoccupation of the British Government; it was the preoccupation of the New Zealand Government; and, being the preoccupation of the British and New Zealand governments, they went through that process of introducing competition without focusing on the principal issue: competition.</PARA>
<PARA> When a government gets people to pay something like $15 billion or $20 billion, it does not rock around to those people and say, `And by the way, while we are getting you to pay $15 billion or $20 billion, we will be working pretty hard to make sure that you cannot get a return on your capital or a return that you would consider satisfactory.' That is the weakness in the Opposition's position when it goes out to members of the public and attempts to convince them that what it is going to do is to produce lower telephone prices for them, because it will not. There is no evidence from anywhere to suggest that it will, if that is the basis on which it intends to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has, in a half-hearted and unsystematic way-which represents the total way that it has approached the question of its communications reform-given evidence of that. The fact that it has a weak, pathetic National Party as its operators now has to some extent excluded from the public the fact that that is so. The Opposition has said to them that they will shift the community service obligations on to the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member has never served in a government. Let me tell him what the Budget process is like. Take an example where a government has $250m rocking around free and it is making a choice between knocking off community service obligations and, perhaps, increasing the price of prescriptions. The honourable member should see where he goes when he is putting up an argument on one of those choices. He might last with community service obligations for a year or two, but then it is out the window. Anybody who knows anything about the governing process knows that that is nothing other than the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On top of that, the Opposition has a $540m investment program proceeding in the bush, which is essential to ensure that people in the bush get an adequate service. That goes on Budget as well, I suppose, amongst these collective geniuses. That means that we have $250m per annum, and then $540m on top of that. That is going to rock into the Budget as far as prices are concerned in this brave new world that the Opposition is putting forward.</PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, in order to be able to effectively introduce any form of competition in this environment, all Telecom's exchanges have to be digitalised. That is another $640m program. So if that is rocked in as well in order to be able to ensure that everybody will benefit from the advantages of competition, the Opposition will have another interesting little problem on its hands, particularly if that is included as a CSO and is essential for competition. The new owner of Telecom is supposed to generate $15 billion to $20 billion off the Australian capital market because the Opposition has said that the majority of its shares must be Australian owned. If the Opposition thinks it can then say to that owner, `By the way, will you sustain that $540m plus the $650m in order to allow your competitors to come in and compete with you, because if it is not there, then there is not any competition?', then it is totally ignorant of the technology of these issues. The reason why we have been going through this exercise is that these issues have to be considered.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot confirm that it vetoed the changes, but I can confirm that the ACTU and its constituent unions had a number of positions in regard to both the telecommunications debate and the airlines debate. I can confirm also to the honourable member that from my reading of the press this morning the unions, including I think some comments from the President of the ACTU, have indicated that they do not support the decision that has been arrived at by the Cabinet and will fight against it. Well, that is interesting. All I can say is that I confirm what I said before, that I have confidence that when the decision has to be made and where it has to be made is in the conference of my Party, because we have a platform position which would not, as it stands, allow us to give effect to the decisions we want to make in the airlines industry and in the telecommunications industry; therefore we go to the conference. I affirm the confidence I have that out of that conference there will come a capacity for the Government to give effect to its decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As distinct from the conservative parties in this country, we will not simply stand there and say that we are going to slog it out and not try to persuade the workers concerned in this matter. We will continue to have discussions with the ACTU and the unions particularly concerned. I believe that out of that process of discussion they will come to understand the models being proposed by the Government, although they do not like them-and they have made that clear. It is not a question of saying they do not like a model that the conservatives are referring to; they do not like what we are talking about. I go back to the same situation I was talking about before, that there are conservatives in the trade union movement, as well as on the other side of politics, who prefer to leave things as they are.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that I personally and those of us in government have a responsibility to the whole of the Labor movement, the political and the industrial movement, to explain that we live in the most rapidly changing times in history, wherein the technology that is involved in the telecommunications industry is a matter of almost month by month change. Many of the assumptions of the present are based upon a technology that is going to be out of date. We cannot maintain a position of integrity and of relevance in 1990 assuming that for the 1990s the technology of the 1980s, the 1970s and the 1960s will apply.</PARA>
<PARA> The new technology makes the assumptions and the attitudes of the past irrelevant and out of date. I have a firm conviction in the capacity of my colleagues and me to persuade the rest of the Labor movement, politically and industrially, of that fact. That confidence is not based simply on some hopeful presumption; it is also based on the fact that in the 7 1/2 years that we have been in office we have had to persuade the Labor movement politically and industrially about a lot of things, a lot of changes. It did not like many of the things initially that we were talking about: the deregulation of the financial sector and the massive reduction in tariffs-and that is something again those opposite would not touch when they were in office. They did nothing about reducing tariffs. Was it because they were too scared of the trade unions? What was it? They were scared of something.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not scared of the trade union movement. Fortunately we have a relationship with its members that means we can talk to them, as we did talk to them about tariffs. Many of them were as bad as honourable members opposite. They did not want to change the tariff structure. But we said that if we are concerned about the future of this country, we cannot maintain a tariff structure of the past. We cannot be going out to the world on behalf of the people that the National Party represent, the farmers of this country, and saying that we have to reduce the barriers around the world and keep up our own. We have to be prepared to change. To the great credit of the Labor movement, those who initially were reluctant to change have been prepared to change. We got through the most significant reductions in tariffs in the history of this country because we went and talked to the trade union movement and persuaded it that these things should be done.</PARA>
<PARA> I say directly to the honourable member that when I express my confidence about our capacity to get these changes, it is based upon an understanding of the way that the union movement has been prepared to listen in the past. It is for that reason, I believe, that after the special conference is finished we will be in a position to give effect to that, in this continuing saga of dramatic micro-economic reform which had to wait until the advent of a Labor government to happen in this country.</PARA>

Coal companies have been living on incremental tonnage as they have taken up those additional contracts and we are now heading into a period where there will be new investment and the Government is looking at that very closely.</PARA>
<PARA> I can also inform the House that the two State governments principally concerned with exports of Australian coal, Queensland and New South Wales, are also very prepared to cooperate with the Commonwealth Government. We have now set up an Australian Coal Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA> Addressing the final part of the honourable member's question, it is quite obvious, of course, that the high value of the dollar certainly does take away some profits for the coal companies. They have a range of strategies, of course: some take up to six months forward cover on those contracts and to some degree they can protect themselves. However, with most coal sold in United States dollars and with the decline in the value of the US dollar, they do face a particular problem at this time. But by and large I think there has been enormous cooperation in this industry. We are poised to get additional tonnages and we will maintain our position as the world's No. 1 coal exporter.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to pay credit to the honourable member for Macarthur and other honourable members, particularly on my side of the House, who take such a close interest in this industry. They have been quietly explaining for a long time to the work force that this is an export exposed industry and that there have to be adjustments in terms of both management and the work force, and these are taking place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, last night the Government-after what seems like months and months of blood-letting and self-immolation- reached what it was pleased to call decisions in principle on the reform of telecommunications in Australia. It is fair to say, by way of compression, that there were three substantial elements in the proposal that was announced last night. The first is that there is to be a combination of Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd, making a megacom, as it has popularly been called. The second proposal, apparently, is that there is to be allowed in this country now, as a great leap forward in the cause of reform, one competitor additional to Telecom in the whole telecommunications area. The third proposal is consistent with the Australian Labor Party's attitude that it is all right to privatise bodies of this sort which are continually making losses. It is a proposal to sell Aussat Pty Ltd, our communications public company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be said at the outset that the reality is a far cry from the description that has been given by the Government of these matters as being decisions in principle because the Australian people, having given consideration to them, could only conclude that if this was reform then it can only be described as a disaster and it can only be concluded that the Government has abandoned all serious attitudes towards bringing in substantial, real and effective reform in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be understood so that we can see where we have got so far as this Government is concerned, where this whole saga started. Of course, it started in the first flush of enthusiasm after the last election when the Government, through the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), announced that this was to be the final gloss put on the golden age of reform. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told in this letter that was conveniently leaked, a letter that was sent by the Prime Minister to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), that this final polish and gloss of substantial reform in a number of areas is now to be added to the history of the Hawke Government. The Prime Minister said in this letter:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our fourth term offers opportunities and carries an obligation to quicken the pace of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the decisions that were made and announced last night we cannot conclude other than that those hopes have been sadly disappointed and that the Government has abandoned any serious attempt to introduce substantial reform in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at what has been proposed by the Government it must surely be conceded that at least two very substantial and fundamental defects are at the root of the Government's proposals. The first is that, as I have said already, one of the proposals is to combine Telecom and OTC. We are opposed to that. We think it is a backward step not only because OTC itself is opposed to it and will be dragged very reluctantly, kicking and protesting, to this forced marriage, but because one cannot conclude other than that the megacom proposal will increase government control over telecommunications in Australia and strengthen government control over the whole industry. If we are looking for freedom, the benefits that come from deregulation and real reform, this is the last step that should be taken-to strengthen government control over telecommunications or anything else-at a time when we want more private investment, more incentive and more productivity in this country. It is a very backward step indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fundamental defect in what has been proposed is that the Government is to allow only one competitor. We and many informed commentators in this area say that that is no competition at all, that is not reform, that is not what was heralded by the Prime Minister in April this year in the letter that he sent to the Minister. To allow one competitor is not to introduce real reform and real competition in telecommunications or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the Opposition that has been promoting that view or pointing out that we will not make progress in this area if we establish a duopoly, as it is called, in place of the monopoly that we presently have. As I pointed out at Question Time, a very respected body, Austel, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, has looked at all the possible models for structuring competition in telecommunications. It looked at this matter specifically in the context of mobile telephones, but what it said applies to other areas, and was clearly intended to do so. In making a sustained economic examination of this area, Austel said that one will achieve nothing by simply putting a duopoly in place instead of the monopoly that one has at the moment. Austel said that that is not reform, it will not introduce competition and it will not give the benefits of competition; it said that if we want real benefits of competition we must go further than simply this one approved single competitor allowed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At Question Time we were told by the Minister that not enough people are making a serious and sustained examination of the detailed issues of this matter. It is worthwhile reflecting that Austel has done it, and this is what Austel said about the duopoly which the present Government is now proposing:</PARA>
<PARA> Because it is relatively easy under a duopoly to match quickly any new competitive initiative taken by a rival, ``live and let live'' attitudes can easily develop such that competition is far more apparent than real and the outcome is little different from that of a monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA>Austel goes on to say that monopoly prices could be charged, no real choice might be offered to the consumer and there could be little incentive for adopting new technologies and minimising costs generally. After a sustained and detailed examination of the economic case for exactly the proposal that the present Government has put forward, Austel concludes that it will get the Government nothing by way of benefits and indeed it will be a retrograde step because we will have price fixing, monopoly prices, very limited real choice and very little improvement for the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel then goes on to look at the other side of the argument and makes out a sustained case for allowing more competition. It says that indeed we will get benefits in prices and in consumer service if we have more than one competitor, if we have a greater competitive structure set up. It says that greater net benefits in terms of overall efficiency and competition in all aspects of the price product service package are potentially achievable under conditions of-as it describes it-oligopoly; that is, of more competitors than there are under a duopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> Austel quite rightly puts the spotlight on those three important aspects-price, product and service. It is saying exactly what the Opposition has maintained through the whole of this debate-that if we want improvements in terms of prices, the product that will be delivered and the service which is to be given to the consumer, then we will not achieve benefits in those areas by simply allowing one government approved competitor to Telecom, but that we must have open competition. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a sustained case in support of open competition. It is a sustained case which the Government has clearly overlooked in coming to the conclusions that it has on this matter. As I have said, it is not simply the case that we have put. From the very day the Industry Commission was established, the Government has placed great reliance on that body. As we heard in Question Time, the Chairman of that body said recently in a speech-how prophetic it was when one looks at these comments-that in the year when we finally dismantled the domestic two-airline agreement and all the inefficiencies that it delivered, it would be ironic if we were to plunge ourselves into another closed system of regulated duopoly in telecommunications. That is what has happened. Ironic it may be or not, but the reality is plain for us all to see now-the Government has plunged this country into yet another closed system of regulated duopoly, this time in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw an additional gloss in Question Time. We had, as I understood it, the concession from the Minister that the proposal put by the Government yesterday will not reduce prices of telephone services but rather that those reductions in prices, if they do come, will come only from more regulation. At the end of the day that seems to be at the bottom of exactly what is now being proposed by the Government-more regulation instead of less. That is what the Government has given us. That is the big disappointment. That is the failure of the Hawke Government in this area of so-called reform. The Government stands condemned for abandoning the one prospect that it had of introducing real competition and getting for the consumers and industry in this country the benefits of true competition. It has abandoned that chance and it was its last opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> As we said last time this matter was put before the Parliament, there is an alternative plan, one which we believe will give industry and consumers very considerable benefits from the policy that we have promoted. It is, as I have said, one which is now supported by Austel itself because it has made out a very strong economic case for the advantages of open competition. We have said that that must be at the top of the list of priorities. The essential ingredient must be competition. We have committed ourselves to full and effective competition in all sectors of telecommunications. It is only when we commit ourselves to that competition that we will get the benefits that telecommunications, properly managed, can give to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we say that not only must there be competition in all areas of telecommunications but also there must be competition in network facilities. It is essential-the Government now seems to be alert to the importance of this-that if we are going to have an effective system of competition then the competitors must have access to the network. In our private members' Bill that has been introduced into the Parliament we have proposed a sensible mechanism for allowing that connection to take place. In that Bill we have made it perfectly plain, as I hope I have again today, that we will achieve nothing by combining Telecom and OTC, other than increasing the stranglehold of government on telecommunications at the very time when we want and need less government control. </PARA>
<PARA> We have said in addition to that that there are a number of specific proposals which have to be addressed and which the Opposition has made a sensible decision on. In the first place they are the proposals with respect to mobile telephones. The Government has now had the Austel report for months. Like most other fields in this area it has been paralysed and been prevented from making a decision on the fairly simple, straightforward proposal of whether the Government monopoly will be allowed to go on dominating the market in mobile telephones or whether the Austel recommendations will be followed in allowing additional competitors. We say it is essential that those additional competitors be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> We have said, in addition to that, that one of the important areas is private networks which already exist. Austel again has made a recommendation, a report, on this. The Government sits on that month after month, apparently unable to make decisions on it. We in the Opposition have committed ourselves to support that recommendation made by Austel for the wider use of private networks. It does not even need legislation. It simply needs a Government directive which the Minister refuses to give. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the alternative proposal, one of full and open competition which will give to the Australian people and to industry and business the benefits that are presently locked up in the telecommunications industry. It will only be by this adoption of full and open competition that those benefits will come. If we go on with the sort of nonsense we have heard from the present Government, particularly last night, we will continue to deny ourselves the true benefits of competition in telecommunications. </PARA>

In fact, it supports the position of oligopoly. It says that there should be three, not two, competitors on cellular mobile telephones and if more than three are put in-and that depends very much on the technology-the benefits of that competition will be lost and prices will rise because technological problems are associated with putting more than three competitors on the network. The document that the honourable member for Menzies presented that he said supported the evidence of open contestability supports only oligopoly and then only oligopoly in circumstances in which the technology is right for it.

<PARA> As it happens, the Government has not taken a decision on that particular Austel report as to whether or not there will be a third mobile licence issue. That is a matter that the Government will consider at a later date after it has got right the issue of competition as far as the basic network is concerned. To rely on that which the Opposition does as some form of evidence that the Government has finally reached a conclusion which has to be excoriated, disapproved of or whatever is absolutely an absurdity. It just shows the extent to which there is inattention on the part of the Opposition to the way in which the Government policy in this area is revolving. </PARA>
<PARA> Another case against it relates to the issue of what the honourable member calls megacom. I think I will form a one-man international nomenclature committee and go around the world telling everybody that they have got to change the names of their Telecoms because they are now obliged to under the sorts of definitions that have emerged here from a combination of Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) and Telecom. They can, it seems, only be described as a megacom. In operating on that criteria, we would have to change the name of British Telecom to British Megacom. We would have to ring up Televerket in Sweden and say, `Change the name of Televerket to Megaverket'. We would have to ring up the people in France, and so on, and go through their particular situations because all of them operate on the basis that their major carriers have an international as well as a domestic operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Merging the 2,000 workers currently in OTC Ltd with the 84,000 workers in Telecom would not mean that Telecom would have increased government power, because they are both government entities. It would simply place the main Australian carrier on the same basis as its overseas equivalents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that an examination of what exists elsewhere might tell us something about the nature of the truly revolutionary changes that the Government is proposing to the conference for the introduction of network competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In his last speech on this matter, the Opposition spokesman cheerfully said that the Opposition had arrived at a policy equivalent to the policies of those nations with which Australia liked to compare itself. Let me go through some basic services: Austria, monopoly; Belgium, government monopoly; Canada, limited competition on trunk services; Denmark, monopoly; Finland, monopoly, regional and international; France, government monopoly; Germany, government monopoly; Greece, government monopoly; Iceland, monopoly; Ireland, government monopoly; Italy, government monopoly; Japan, competition types 1 and 2-and that does not incorporate all of the network; Luxembourg, government monopoly; Netherlands, government monopoly; New Zealand, competition, but there is no effective competitor yet; Norway, monopoly; Portugal, national duopoly, international monopoly; Spain, monopoly; Sweden, no formal monopoly, but there is no competitor; Switzerland, competition; United Kingdom, duopoly under review; United States of America, monopoly on local, competition on trunk services. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the situation as we look around the globe. It might actually tell us something about the nature of the communications industry and why it is that when we sit down and look at the requirements to reform the communications industry, we do not charge ahead with mindless theories from the Chicago business school and seek to impose them on what the Government is doing; rather, we look seriously at whether or not there may be some natural barriers to entry and whether or not those barriers ought to be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody on the Government side assumes that any particular decision that we will arrive at on these matters is immutable. None of us assumes that the telecommunications industry is fixed through time. The reason why the Labor Government can afford to make that assumption is that we alone among governments in this country have addressed the issue of the breakdown by technological change of the saliency of monopoly arrangements in the national telecommunications system. </PARA>
<PARA> We alone have been the people who have started the reform process by the corporatisation of Telecom. We alone have addressed the issues by opening up value added services to competition. One of the reasons why we can talk now about private networks is that there has been a substantial expansion of those private networks in the regulatory operations that this Government has put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government established Austel. Austel did not exist before we came into office. This Government imposed on Telecom the discipline of fixing a basket of prices to ensure that prices did not increase, except in line with the rate of inflation. These are decisions taken by this Government. Nothing was done by the Opposition when it was in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In Question Time I quoted statements made by the honourable member for Menzies when he actually did have responsibility for this area. Each of those statements expressed increasing desperation on his part to convince the electorate that he was committed to a policy of retaining Telecom as the national provider of the terrestrial network and that it was, in fact, the Labor Party which was putting forward this dangerous proposal of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> This type of attitude is typical of this Opposition. It has the luxury of its status in opposition to make the sorts of statements that it never dared make in government. Honourable members opposite addressed none of these issues when they were in government. The history of the Labor Party is one of a persistent preparedness to face up to the requirement for change in this area, as in so many others. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member said about private networks may well be true. What he said about the third cellular mobile licence may well be true. Nothing that the Government is proposing to this conference chops off those options as far as the Government is concerned. What the Government is concerned with in the statement that it made yesterday is the issue of network competition and how to get it. We cannot get network competition in an environment in which we are simply saying, `There should be no regulation; there should be no person, no authority, in a position to ensure that there is a fair interconnect price, that the technologies of interconnect are fair to those coming in'. There are a couple of nations that have tried the Opposition's open contestability model: one is New Zealand and the other is Sweden. </PARA>
<PARA> In Sweden, the situation is that effectively the national monopoly regulates itself; it regulates the price at which people may interconnect with it; it regulates the terms and conditions under which people may interconnect with it. True, it has very low prices, but nobody would seriously suggest that that situation permits to come into that country an effective competitor. One cannot compete in those circumstances. If one is introducing competition in telecommunications, one cannot run away from a requirement for a regulator, a requirement for regulation, a requirement to ensure fair practice that goes beyond simply the court system. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand it is protected only by the court system. Anybody who knows what is happening now inside the New Zealand telecommunications system knows that there is enormous pessimism about whether or not it is going to get added to its situation a competitor. There is already beginning in New Zealand debate around the proposition that, after this election is over, they have to start to lever in an opponent for New Zealand Telecom if they are going to be able to achieve their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> So this is not immutable. If one cites the Opposition's experience with two-airline agreement policies, one may well come to the conclusion that it is. The record of the Opposition when it came to a two-airline policy was to maintain it for 25 years or thereabouts, and one would be entitled to think that that was the end of the matter once a duopoly had been created, if one went on the past record of the Opposition when in government. Of course, as soon as this Government had an opportunity to address the two airlines agreement, straight out the window it went. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter, however, is that this Government addresses not a situation now where there is competition, it addresses a situation where there is a monopoly-a monopoly that is worth, in terms of its infrastructure, somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion. That says something about what the price of entry is for anyone who would compete with it. To get anything like an alternative network to Telecom over a reasonable period of time, we have to talk at a minimum $3 billion to $5 billion. Who is going to invest $3 billion to $5 billion-certainly which Australian is going to invest $3 billion to $5 billion-in an operation where there is no regulator in place to ensure that interconnect is available at a reasonable price; where there is no regulator in place to ensure access on a reasonable basis to Telecom's networks? Who is going to do that? Who is going to invest those moneys, given Telecom's enormous market power?</PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the Opposition one thing that it will not do. It will not increase any confidence on the part of that particular firm coming in if it is saying, `And by the way, as you come in from a standing start to operate against Telecom'-that sector of private enterprise which is prepared to do that-`we will be providing an opportunity for other sectors of private enterprise to buy Telecom'. Picture such a private enterprise investor sitting at a table at the AMP Society planning an investment program. Is he going to put $2 billion into the competitor of Telecom or is he going to buy Telecom? Is he going to put $2 billion into not just the competitor of Telecom but what may be a dozen competitors of Telecom, or is he going to put that money into Telecom itself as it is privatised?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made the fundamental error on every piece of historical analysis that can be done on the introduction of competition by combining those two. The Opposition tries to get over the problem of its fundamental error by saying, `Well, competition comes first, ahead of privatisation'. The same consideration applies. If privatisation is going to take place in three or four years, and under a duopolistic framework a profit stream is not going to be established in anything under five years, is an investor going to wait for two or three years and invest in a very effective telecommunications company or is it going to try its hand out there in the market against that and against everybody else who decides to come in? Obviously not. The issue has to be decided once and for all on whether we are going to privatise or not. That is an absolutely threshold decision for anyone who is going to make a decision about whether or not to invest in communications. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, if the Opposition says, `We will also force this particular company to take on board a requirement to provide funds for opponents coming in, a requirement to provide CSOs and a requirement for it to continue its current investment program', then the Opposition is just in the realm of absurdity. One would have a bit more confidence that the Opposition had actually thought some of these issues through had it not, apart from the privatisation proposal, declared its position on communications on day one after the last election. After the last election the Opposition had as part of its competitive model virtually all that the honourable member for Menzies has recently announced. No thought went into it; no Austel reports were examined. If the Austel reports had been examined, the Opposition would have discovered that Austel was talking about an oligopoly and not an open, competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition had put itself into a thought process, it might have come up with something pretty good. But the problem for the Opposition is that if it had actually put itself into that thought process it would know that it had to find some way of levering in competition. Anybody who has tried that has understood it. The Opposition would know that if one is levering in competition and is really going to produce competition, not just the sell down of a government asset, then one is going to have in place a regulator-and that means having in place regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I can see that we are going to have an awful lot of difficulty getting over threshold issues in this particular debate as time rolls by. Certain words are anathema to the Opposition. The word `regulators' is out of the window; `contestability' has to be the almighty God; and `privatisation' has to be central. The trouble is that the logical consequences of having these concepts floating free without any sensible policy conclusion is that in the end one has no policy at all-and in fact the Opposition has no policy at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If all that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) says is right, why is it that he is one of the only Ministers in the Cabinet that came to the position that he did and that all the economic Ministers came to a completely different view? We have seen over the last several weeks and, indeed, months a series of leaks while the Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) competed for space to try to get the particular issue up. A lot of the issues that the Minister raises are, unfortunately, avoiding the very point and the decision that has just been made-that is, it takes Australia nowhere and is only a political compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) said, from our point of view where we need to start is greater competition, and that is all about contestability. Indeed, we have looked at the Austel reports and seen what they say. It is a pity that the Government does not take account of the reports and allow some contestability in the marketplace, because that is where the real benefits will come to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Often when we have these matters of public importance, truncated as they are by a shortage of time, there is not enough time to deal with all the issues. So I want to pick up some of the points made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today, because this decision is in two parts. Firstly, how is the Government going to deal with the problems and decay within the Australian Labor Party (ALP)? Indeed, the Minister was sent out with an almost impossible task. He is a not so skilled plastic surgeon and he had to work out how to repair the deeply afflicted, cracked and rapidly ageing face of the ALP in the Australian body politic. Secondly, the Minister had to rearrange the organs of the telecommunications body in order to conceal the horrible truth that one of its elements, namely, Aussat Pty Ltd, had been bleeding to death through the Government's own incompetence, which all happened in 1983 when it took the decision to make sure that Aussat could not compete effectively with the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), as it then was, or Telecom Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister would well know-and I am sure that he would nod if he was in the chamber-that what the Government is doing by taking OTC Ltd and putting it into Telecom is capturing OTC's earning stream and putting it into Telecom to avoid for Telecom the problem that is happening to the airlines, which is a shortage of equity and the need to go out and make further borrowings. If public bodies keep coming back to the Government, the Government has to put more taxpayers' dollars into those organisations, and that means higher taxes as a result of these organisations requiring greater and greater amounts of equity. The Minister is conducting a con-a cosmetic reconstruction to deal with the crisis of Aussat. It is also not really very good economics. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if we have a look at the whole decision and read what has been said by, I suppose, one of the Government's friends-at least, it does not appear to be one of our friends-we see that today's Australian Financial Review said this:</PARA>
<PARA> The Cabinet decision, which represents a major victory for the Government's political pragmatists over the economic ministers, comes after an internal battle which leaves deep scars  . . . within the Government and a perception of a divided Government which was forced to settle for an economically inferior compromise. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is a compromise that the Government has dealt up here. It has not addressed all the issues that need to be addressed. We have addressed the question of competition and how we want to have greater competition. We can talk on another day about interconnect, public service monopolies, satellites and the declining relevance of that technology, optic fibres, and so on. The Government said in Question Time today that we do not understand technology. Give us the time and we will show that we do understand technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason that the Government took OTC into Telecom was to grab its earnings stream because in two or three years time Telecom will have the same problem as the airlines now have. The Government wants to get that earnings stream and put it in there now. It wants to cut out Aussat, capitalise the losses and sell it off. But the fundamental problem there is whether we should or should not have public ownership. We have taken the decision that, once the competitive model is established within Telecom, one can then move towards privatisation. It has happened in other countries, some examples of which the Minister has referred to. Who owns the shares is not fatal to the delivery of the service. All that happens generally when one has a private operator of that monopoly or, indeed, a competitive functional arrangement within a national boundaries system, is far greater competition, and that translates into far more productivity. The end result, of course, is that consumers get some benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Public ownership is a misnomer. The public have no say in the acquisition, use, funding or disposal of state enterprises. For example, the public ownership of Aussat has meant that the Government could appropriate from the Australian people, without asking them, $100m to stem the flow of blood resulting from public ownership. The privatising of Aussat and OTC-our policy at the last election-and now Telecom is about giving people the opportunity to own, profit from and dispose of a share of it. Privatising these bodies also enables the Government to raise much needed capital from equity rather than borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is privatisation important? The Government seems to step away from privatisation because it knows that it cannot have it both ways. The Government wants to privatise the airlines but it does not believe that privatising the telecommunications area is in any way a solution. Yet it is prepared to embrace the privatisation of Aussat for all the wrong reasons. Given the huge size of government business enterprises (GBEs), their efficiency and commercialism is of great importance if the thrust towards greater economic efficiency, higher productivity and international competitiveness is to be fully realised. Public trading enterprises account for about 10 per cent of total gross domestic product (GDP) and employ at least 400,000 people or 7 per cent of the total work force. They account for well over half the total public gross fixed capital expenditure, which is about 4 per cent of GDP. About one-quarter of the total assets of GBEs in Australia are in Commonwealth enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has identified micro-economic reform as the area for attention, yet it appears to be failing rather abysmally. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development 1990 economic survey of Australia and the 1989 Industries Assistance Commission report on public sector enterprises warn that public enterprises as a whole have unacceptably low productivity levels and are uncompetitive in international terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am making about public ownership-and this is the area in which the Prime Minister wants to fight this debate in the future-is that the net rate of return on capital averages 3.1 per cent compared with 16.4 per cent for the public sector. It is a huge difference. Public sector inefficiencies cost Australia over 3 per cent of GDP. Capital expenditure on transport and communications is 40 per cent of all capital outlays and represents 3.6 per cent of GDP. Structural reform in these areas could boost GDP by over $6 billion. The Minister for Transport and Communications should not shake his head because those figures come from the Secretary of his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economy is in trouble after seven years of stewardship from this Government. These problems have to be addressed. We might argue about how best to do that, but it is certain that the Government cannot go back to the Australian taxpayer continually and ask for more capital for the Aussat-type problem, which will be multiplied unless the decisions are taken to do what is happening in other countries in the world-inject competition and move out of public ownership into privatisation. Call it what you want, but privatisation has to happen, because the economic imperatives are going to drive the Government to that conclusion, just as they are with the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be that the Minister for Transport and Communications will not be able to bring his Party to agree to that course, as its members seem to disagree with everything he says. Certainly government ownership of enterprises has stifled the management of these organisations and has prevented the necessary efficiency improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of privatisation, there are many other issues that I shall address at some future time about the ability of the capital markets to step in and offer to the Australian public and others an opportunity to take a share in Telecom. This is what I imagine the Government will try to do, somewhat unsuccessfully, with the Commonwealth Bank and the airlines. The same will happen with Telecom as is happening in a whole range of public infrastructures provided by governments in other countries. They realise that you cannot keep going back with cap in hand to the people. The Minister is undermining the whole economic fabric by making this decision. At a time when the rest of the world is getting small, the Minister wants to get bigger. Why? Because he has a fundamental misunderstanding of what efficiency is, how to obtain productivity and what is the best direction for this country to go in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has locked himself into a political deal. He has tried to run ahead of some of the economic Ministers, to beat them to the punch at the 24 September conference. He may well rue the day when he went down this route because it will not deliver to Australia what this country needs for the future and it does not address the issue of a marching technology that makes a lot of the proposals the Minister has put forward quite irrelevant in terms of time. If the Minister locks us into this position for seven years, in two years' time we will be in real trouble, as we will be even more uncompetitive than we are now. </PARA>
<PARA> The person who will respond to this debate is the chairman of the Government's backbench committee. A report in the Australian Financial Review, headed `Key Beazley man slams megacom plan', refers to the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). Why does he slam it? The report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Stinging criticism reflects the view in Caucus that Mr Beazley's plan is too tough on Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the other part of the deal. This is all about preserving featherbedding and preserving privilege for the biggest union in Australia, whose membership will increase from 85,000 to nearly 90,000 once it is given OTC. This deal has been done for all the wrong economic reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak in this debate. The first thing I should point out to the House is the real tragedy that on the issue of Australia's communications future and the different approaches by the Government and the Opposition, the National Party of Australia has wimped out of the debate. The National Party has sold out. It has sold out its rural constituencies. I have never known such an important debate in the House on a matter of public importance when a member of the National Party has not at least contributed. But the Nationals have wimped out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) raised two major defects in the Beazley plan, both of which I am pleased to say I totally support. First, he said that it is defective because Telecom Australia and OTC Ltd are to be merged. What he does not say is that Australia is one of only three countries where the public carriers do not carry domestic and international traffic; one of only three. The honourable member for Menzies is saying that all the other countries have got it wrong and Australia is the only one that has got it right. Of course the separation was always an historical quirk. </PARA>
<PARA> The other complaint raised by the honourable member that was dealt with by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was that there will be an increase in government regulation. Let me quote from Hansard what was said previously by the honourable member for Menzies. Incidentally, in reviewing the conservative years of rule he said that there had been more reviews in this area than there had been in the Folies Bergeres. In fact the conservative Government's record on micro-economic reform was absolutely nil. At best I can mention two matters. First, it developed the concept of the Australian Post Office, whatever that meant, and whatever impact it had; and secondly, it applied interest on the borrowings of Telecom. Those were its only reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> In tabling the report of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunication Services in Australia, the honourable member for Menzies, who was the then Minister, suggested a few things that should be done. In regard to Telecom's pricing policy he said:</PARA>
<PARA>It should reflect costs to a substantial degree. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as National Party members are concerned, that means one writes off the bush. One has real costing in the bush; that is what it means. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . minimise price discrimination</PARA>
<PARA>That means that one has a situation where tariffs are increased. Another suggestion was to adopt timed local calls. Is there any pronouncement by the new shadow Minister, the honourable member for Menzies, who was a former Minister, rejecting timed local calls or saying why he is now no longer in favour of them? In that tabling statement the honourable member also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Cross-subsidisation should be reduced to levels which Telecom can absorb yet remain competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member has changed his position on that and he wants to put it on budget. Back in 1988 when the Department was pushing for cross-subsidisation to be on budget, that was rejected for all the reasons that the Minister for Transport and Communications has outlined. It would be the first thing that any Treasurer from either side of the House would cut. Would the Opposition say, `Because of the circumstances we are being forced to make this cut, but we will expect the cross-subsidies to continue'? Of course it would not. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies is also on record as saying that he favours Telecom being preserved in public ownership. Has there been an explanation by the shadow Minister as to where the transmogrification was arrived at? That statement appears in Hansard. When and why has he changed?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also mentioned that the Beazley package failed because it only provided one competitor. He cited the Austel report. Austel was looking at the cellular mobile; in fact it sent an officer overseas to have a look at cellular mobiles. Of course it reached the conclusion in the report that there ought to be three competitors and not one. Let me point out to the honourable member for Menzies that if Austel were bringing down a report about the customer premise equipment area, it would be saying that three was an inadequate number, as it currently is, and that there ought to be many more. One cannot have a report into a specific area of activity and then generalise.</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in this debate whenever one suggests that there ought to be a competitor established, people argue that it will not be a real competitor, it will not be a robust competitor. When an attempt is made to put regulations in place so that the competitor can grow and it will not be wiped out by the larger organisation, the honourable member for Menzies objects and wants to go one further. Not only does he want there to be difficulties with the second competitor growing, but he argues that there should be a third competitor. What competitive force will that provide against such a big organisation? In fact it will be 10 times harder for two to establish a toe-hold than it will be for one. That suggestion should be rejected for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA> In this debate the most tragic thing about the Opposition's lack of vision is that it cannot see the international opportunities that are present for Australia-for its carriers and for Australian industry. Opposition members have no view that Australian industry is capable of getting out, particularly into the Asian market, and competing. They have no view of that at all. Their sole preoccupation is on two things: one is to privatise, particularly Telecom; and secondly, to wipe out industry. In fact they have done more pirouettes on industry policy since they have been in opposition than I have seen ever before. They have no view that one can have carriers pulling through industry, that not only can Australian industry improve its current performance, but also we can get more out of it. What does it mean if we do get more out of it? It means that there are more dollar exports-something this country desperately needs. The Opposition has said not a word about that. And of course there will be more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone seems to be calling in aid the name of Chifley. I feel very comfortable in being the member for Chifley and in saying that I think he would approve of an approach that looked internationally for more export dollars and created more jobs, both within the competitor and in Australian industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) spoke about Aussat and all the problems of Aussat have been heaped on this Government. Aussat was the creation of the Opposition and yet the Government is supposed to be at fault. The real problem with Aussat is that it is a single technology company. In this day and age no single technology company will survive, particularly when its main form of competition, optic fibre, has come down so dramatically and will continue to come down more so in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of saying that the Government has not had the guts to attack structural reform, let me mention the airlines. It is very interesting to note that three months before the 1961 election the Opposition, which is so much against duopolies, in fact extended the airline agreement-not by five years, but by 14 years. In the early 1980s the Opposition did it again. It entrenched it for eight years and required 12 months notice. Do we hear Opposition members talking about their proud record on waterfront reform? What did they ever do? `More reviews than the Folies Bergeres', were the words of the Opposition's shadow Minister for privatisation, and I will throw them back at him. What reforms did the Opposition accomplish in rail or road? Absolutely none. In an industry that is estimated by the year 2010 to represent 35 per cent of gross domestic product, all the Opposition is interested in doing is privatising. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at what happens overseas when bodies are privatised, one can see that prices go up. Prices have to be lifted in order to make it more attractive. What is inherent in the Beazley plan? The plan is designed to ensure that there are regulations, of course, to ensure that the cross subsidy is preserved, to ensure that ordinary customers continue to benefit from real declining prices and to ensure that there will be price capping. Of course, there is regulation; of course we want to make sure that we are looking after ordinary customers. We do not want to repeat the experience of countries overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> When one privatises the main carrier, as the Opposition proposes to do, prices increase and the people who are hit in the neck are ordinary domestic consumers and small businesses. Not only has the National Party turned its back on rural and provincial Australia, but also the Liberal Party is turning its back on small business. I, along with my colleagues on the Government side, believe that the decision taken by Cabinet has been a landmark decision which we support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report attempts to address the difficult and controversial issue of illegal entry and to come to a balanced view of how that illegal population should be dealt with. I believe this to be the most detailed and thoroughly debated proposal concerning illegal immigration ever put forward for consideration by the Australian people. The Committee is of the view that every effort is to be made to deal seriously with the problem of illegals. In order to do this it is necessary to both impose penalties and provide encouragement for people to come forward and meet the Government deadline of 31 October 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before outlining our proposals, I should like to make some introductory comments. The Committee was established by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) with a wide-ranging brief to consider changes to the Migration Act and regulations and any other matters referred by the Minister. As a priority, the Committee wished to address the difficult and sensitive issue of illegal entrants, given the impending end of the limited concessionary arrangements on 1 June 1990 and 30 June 1990, which required them, firstly, to leave Australia, thereby not incurring any time penalty should they wish to re-apply immediately for entry to Australia; or, secondly, to apply to regularise their status on spouse or economic grounds. </PARA>
<PARA> This deadline was perceived by the Committee to create serious problems of implementation for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs of any recommendations requiring amendment and of potential injustice to those affected. Hence, once the Committee decided to inquire into matters affecting illegals, it considered that it would be unfair if some people were required to leave after 30 June and before the Committee had an opportunity to report to the Parliament. As Chairman of the Committee, I therefore wrote to the Minister on 20 June 1990 arguing that, while not wishing to encourage illegals currently here to remain, the Committee was seeking further evidence in respect of these matters and therefore requested an extension of time beyond the current 1 June and 30 June dates until 30 September 1990 for the concessional arrangements now applicable, and for the voluntary departure without the re-entry restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister agreed to extend the concessionary period until 31 October 1990, but emphasised that this would be the final deadline. The Committee further determined that, in order to give the Minister and Cabinet adequate time to consider the report and draft any necessary legislative amendments, it would report as soon as possible in September. This extremely tight reporting deadline imposed severe constraints on the Committee, its secretariat and its adviser. The Committee is of the view that if it is to meet time constraints in the future, deadlines may need to be more reasonable and will require a hefty increase in the resources of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Much interest has been generated in the report. To date, over 90 submissions have been received. The Committee also held public hearings in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney consulting with a large number of community groups, as well as the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I must take the opportunity to point out the severe practical difficulties that the complexity of the regulations has caused to many people. It was a common complaint raised in submissions and at the public hearings. The issue has also been raised by Mr Justice Wilcox in a recent Federal Court case when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The task of ascertaining the position in relation to a particular applicant or a particular type of visa or entry permit is akin to feeling one's way through a labyrinth. </PARA>
<PARA>I and my fellow Committee members can only concur with that sentiment. However, we recognise that a revised and simplified version of the regulations has been promised by the Minister. The Committee regards that exercise as having a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the report. Australia's migration laws have been developed to control the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia. There is, therefore, a need to maintain the Government's migration program within pre-determined levels and to enable the removal of persons who are either in Australia illegally or whose presence in Australia is not in the best interests of the Australian community. However, there is also a need to consider some of the cases of those people who were here illegally prior to 19 December 1989 when the law changed so dramatically, and where it can be shown that their cases merit consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not condone or encourage illegality as a back door to permanent entry to Australia. It supports the efforts of the Government and the Department to, firstly, minimise current levels of illegal entry and, secondly, prevent a future problem. However, the Committee is unaware of any other developed country which has automatic and mandatory deportation for nearly all of its illegals, as is the case under the tough provisions of the new model. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Committee believes that some limited opportunity should be made available for a small proportion of the total number of illegals to regularise their status. The people we are concerned about are some of the people who may be innocently illegal-those who have a compelling compassionate case or those who have been absorbed into Australian society for at least five years and who can show that they have made a substantial contribution to Australia. Such a limited window of opportunity will encourage people to come forward before 31 October and will help to minimise the extent of the illegal `twilight society'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is further concerned that the Government's intention that illegal entrants should come forward before 31 October 1990 will not be fulfilled unless the new control model is tempered with discretion and compassion. The Committee believes that the main way of dealing with the problems of long term illegal immigrants, generally, is by empowering the Immigration Review Tribunal to consider applications from illegal immigrants who come forward or who are apprehended before 31 October 1990. This Tribunal would be empowered, in the case of innocent illegals, to make recommendations to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and, in all other cases, to make a determination. A special category of people which the Committee is particularly concerned about is those people who are now illegal or who, in the future, may become illegal through no fault of their own. The Committee is unanimous in its concern about this particular category of people-the innocent illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that people can become illegal even if they are honest in their dealings with immigration staff, have no knowledge of the illegality or have no intention of becoming an illegal. Certain children born or residing in Australia fall into this category. The Committee argues that innocent illegals, here illegally through no fault of their own, should have the opportunity to regularise their status. </PARA>
<PARA> All members of the Committee, with the exception of Senator McKiernan, are of the view that the Immigration Review Tribunal should consider the cases of the innocent illegals and other cases of compassion. We thus strongly recommend the expanded role of the Tribunal. In general, the Committee resolved that an illegal immigrant would be able to apply to the tribunal provided that he or she has been:</PARA>
<PARA>in Australia for at least five years prior to 31 October 1990 (that is arrived in Australia prior to 31 October 1985) and is able to present evidence demonstrating this fact; and</PARA>
<PARA> has come forward and presented themselves to the Registrar of the Immigration Tribunal before 31 October 1990 by either:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) completing an application form as outlined below; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) completing a notice of intent to lodge such an application in which they undertake to complete a full application form by the 15th December 1990; and</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) completes such application form by 15 December;</PARA>
<PARA>is able to present information and evidence which would satisfy the Tribunal that they have made a positive and substantial contribution to Australia during the period in which they had been in Australia; or</PARA>
<PARA>can demonstrate that there are compelling or compassionate circumstances which contributed to the applicant's illegal standing and which should be taken into account by the Tribunal as reasons for granting stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In making its determination, the Tribunal will take note of the following relevant circumstances in the case of those applying under paragraph 32.2(b):</PARA>
<PARA>age;</PARA>
<PARA>length of residence in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>strength of connections with Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>personal history, including character, conduct and employment record;</PARA>
<PARA>domestic circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>compassionate circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA>any representation received on the person's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA>In rare cases where there are compelling and compassionate circumstances and where persons have been in Australia less than five years or were prevented by serious intervening circumstances from making an application before 31 October 1990, such persons may seek leave of the Registrar of the Tribunal to lodge an application for the Tribunal's consideration. This clause is to be used only in rare cases. </PARA>
<PARA> A further issue of concern to the Committee which particularly affects innocent illegals is the requirement in regulation 42 that, where an applicant for an entry permit is illegal, the application has to be lodged not more than 12 months after the person became illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> Innocent illegals are predominantly children and/or those who are unaware they are illegal. The illegality may not be discovered until many years after the time when the person became illegal, yet he or she will be caught by Regulation 42, no matter what their circumstances may be. The Committee has recommended in chapter 5 of its report that provision for a waiver of the time period for lodgment of an application in appropriate circumstances be incorporated in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the Committee in recommending its general approach is in no way trying to undermine or prejudice the Government's program of control of illegals. On the contrary, it is concerned that the Government's intentions `will not be fulfilled unless the control model is tempered with discretion and compassion'. The five-year qualifying period for applications has been strongly supported by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils at its recent national conference and by many ethnic community representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> On pages 73 and 74 of the report, we outline our assessment of the total number likely to be allowed to remain in Australia as a result of this process. Of the 90,000 illegal entrants, between 3,000 and 4,000 are likely to be able to stay. This is not a large number in the total illegal population but it will deal with the most deserving cases. I reject the argument that this concession will establish a precedent and that people will be encouraged to hide away for five years and then come forward, hoping to take advantage of the scheme. This is a complete misrepresentation of the intentions of the Committee and the nature of the scheme. This will be a one-off scheme and not ongoing. The cut-off point of 31 October 1985 is intended to be absolute and not a movable feast. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is serious about enforcing the 31 October deadline, it must publicise the fact that people must come forward by that date, otherwise they will suffer penalties and certainly will receive no further concessions of this nature. Indeed, it is because of the severity of the scheme after 31 October 1990 that the Committee has decided that this one-off concession should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, there are many other matters and recommendations in the report which we urge all honourable members to consider and we urge the Government to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to thank my fellow Committee members for their time and efforts in getting this first report to Parliament. I should also like to express the Committee's gratitude to Dr Kathryn Cronin, the legal consultant to the Committee. Dr Cronin's dedication, professionalism and expertise are highly valued by the Committee. I should also like to thank the staff of the secretariat, Robina Mills and Heidi Quinlan, for the enormous work which they put in during the last few weeks in getting this report together for honourable members. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak and respond to this, the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, entitled Illegal Entrants in Australia-Balancing Control and Compassion. There is one thing with which I agree with the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who spoke on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, and that is that balancing control and compassion is a difficult exercise. It is a matter which members of the Committee grappled with over some months. I would encourage those who are interested in this matter to read the report and also to read the dissenting reports because what becomes apparent is that balancing control and compassion is a matter on which there are numbers of different views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are in this case, Mr Deputy Speaker, the views of the majority that comprised four members of the Committee of 10. The report shows that one member of the Committee was unable to attend meetings of the Committee and took no part in its deliberations, and he regretted that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter, there are dissenting reports by me and Senator Olsen. Senator McKiernan dissented, Senator Cooney dissented and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) dissented. We dissented, I might say, in different ways and on different aspects of the report. But it is significant that in reading this report the view of the majority clearly lacks authority. It is not a report that ought to persuade the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). </PARA>
<PARA> There are aspects about which I should like to simply reinforce strongly the view of the Committee and the honourable member who spoke before me. In relation to the question of the framework of law in which this question of illegal immigration is addressed, it is clear that the law is so complex that a judge described it as feeling one's way through a labyrinth. I would further quote the judge where he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>As will already be apparent, understanding the regulations is no easy matter. Apart from the initial problem of obtaining an up-to-date text of the regulations, the reader is confronted with a lengthy and complex document, abounding with cross-references, from one provision to another. </PARA>
<PARA>It was because of those comments that the judge went on to make the observation that he did. The honourable member for Calwell draws certain conclusions from that. I draw different conclusions. The conclusion I draw is that the way in which this law was implemented last year was fundamentally flawed. Mistakes were made but they were mistakes of the Government's own making. They were not the mistakes of the Opposition. They were not the mistakes of the Australian Democrats. They were mistakes of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister described the decision-making process as one of trial and error. I thought that was a remarkable statement. I made the observation in relation to that that I thought it was far more error than trial. The fact is that the law is flawed. The law was not brought forward with a proper consideration of matters of compassion nor were the issues of control properly balanced. Members of the Committee saw fit to seek an extension of time to enable consideration of this matter. The Committee, as is clear, has worked under a very considerable difficulty because the time was not there for it to come to considered conclusions on which all members could agree. But the timing was a matter upon which the Government took advice from the Committee. It was not timing which I supported, as honourable members will know. The minutes show that I dissented in relation to that matter; it was not a unanimous decision of the Committee. I had a concern at that time that we would be giving mixed messages in relation to the Government's resolve to deal with the question of illegal immigration were we to add further to the time in which people might consider their positions under the framework of law introduced by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member who spoke before me, the honourable member for Calwell, indicated that this was a significant problem, but the report, in my view, still-as the Government does-gives estimates which largely understate the enormity of it. The Government now admits that 90,000 illegals exist. Until the Committee started its work the Government persisted with the view that there were merely 60,000 illegals in Australia. That figure came about as a result of our deliberations and pressing for information. To that number of 90,000 should be added the 30,000 applicants for grant of residence status who are in the pipeline for processing and whose circumstances are presently being considered. It may well be that a majority of them will have to leave, but certainly a majority of those are illegal. They are made valid only because they have been permitted to be processed. </PARA>
<PARA> To that should be added the 20,000 People's Republic of China (PRC) nationals granted temporary residency. Most of those have not been included in illegal calculations to date, yet clearly, as was shown by the information made available by the Government, many of them even at the time of Tiananmen Square were then illegal. Nor has the Government added most of the 25,000 PRC students who arrived post Tiananmen Square and are now in breach of these conditions. As most of those arrived more than six months ago on six-month visas, I would have to say that the majority, no doubt, are now illegal. I suggest that the total figure is closer to 150,000. That is the size and nature of the problem that we have to address. The numbers are greater than the total migration program for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Lack of resolve in dealing with this issue is the most significant factor contributing to the growth of illegal entry. Mixed signals which have been given by the Government over time-and I have to say extensions of time constitute such mixed signals-are an invitation to those who want to come here and find that under our framework of law they are excluded. All of this has been compounded by the flawed and poorly drafted delegated legislation. Each attempt to address the difficulties has led to a postponement of compliance activities and it has held out the prospect of regularisation of status to illegals within Australia whether or not this was the case or the intention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that further significant steps to expand the circumstances in which claims to remain here in Australia may be advanced will only further serve to undermine the Government's compliance efforts. In coming to a view as to what the balance should be, the majority of Committee members in this case have come to a view that the range of circumstances which might be considered should be further widened. I have to say, first, that the scheme, when reduced to its simplest elements, accommodates the applications of innocent illegals at any time. I have to say I think that cases of innocent illegals ought to be capable of being addressed. Secondly, the scheme accommodates those with compelling and compassionate claims. They can also be made at any time. I have to say in relation to those matters that I think the test ought to be stronger than just compelling and compassionate claims, and I come to that view in my minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> It provides further that those who apply before 31 October 1990 shall have an entitlement if they have been here five years or more to stay on permanently on what are called absorption grounds. Honourable members may be interested to know how many people that affects, how many people would have an entitlement to lodge an application. On page 20 of the report it indicates that of the 60,000 people that the Government previously thought to be in Australia illegally-and the Committee was advised of this on 7= June-more than 10,159 people are so affected. The honourable member who spoke before me endeavoured to rationalise that figure down, but that is the number who would be entitled to lodge applications. If that does not send a signal, I do not know what would. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say that I believe that the scheme proposed by my colleagues is defective in three important respects. First, it is unduly complex and difficult to follow. Secondly, it tends to confirm in the minds of prospective illegals that simply by staying on in Australia eventually governments will relent and permanent residency will be possible. Further, where breaches of our law are concerned, it rewards them. We know that most illegals in Australia obtain employment in breach of section 83 of the Act and the absorption test proposed by the majority involves looking at those people who have worked here illegally and, if they have paid taxes, rewarding them for it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are really only two matters that need to be dealt with. The first is that of innocent illegals, as identified by the Committee in chapter three of the report. Secondly, in the most compelling, compassionate and deserving cases-where, in my view, it would be unconscionable to require a person in Australia temporarily or illegally to leave- some limited, residual discretion should exist to enable claims to be made and processed. It is in those very limited, compelling, tragic and compassionate circumstances that I suggest that the Tribunal set up by the Government should be in a position, where circumstances are drawn to its attention, to recommend to the Minister-not to determine the matter; not to take the matter out of the hands of the Government- that he look at the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching its decision, the Tribunal would have to have regard to these factors: the public interest, which would normally suggest that deportation would be a proper course; that the circumstances that are to be considered would most likely have arisen since the person arrived in Australia; that the strength of connections with Australia which would result in further residency being continued were sufficiently substantial that it would be a preferable result to deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, absorption of less than nine years certainly would not be seen as a factor on its own that would warrant any consideration by the Tribunal in making its recommendation. It is recognised in the table to which I referred that some 874 people have been in the country illegally for nine years or more. I have suggested further qualifications to that matter so that the Minister may ensure that it does not become one where control of the program is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to note in relation to those matters recommended by me that my colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who has put in a separate dissenting report, picks up many of those recommendations that I have made. I think it is important to note that my colleague Senator McKiernan, who is a Government member, makes it very clear that, while he condones the Minister's having some responsibility in looking at innocent illegals, he is also very worried about the prospect of watering down and backing away from announced enforcement policies of the Government yet again. He would see that as being a sign of weakness by his own Government, were it to succumb on this matter. Senator Cooney goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I am unable to endorse the majority report. I give my reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>He says further:</PARA>
<PARA>That balance is to be struck in circumstances where there is room only for a small proportion of the thousands upon thousands of people who want to settle here. The acceptance as a permanent resident of someone who until then has been present illegally means the denial of entry to another who has obeyed the law in seeking entry to Australia. That poses an issue of equity. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to make the point that he does not believe that these matters have been properly and fairly determined by the elaborate process suggested by the majority of members. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Minister will take on board the view of the majority who dissented. It is put in different ways but the report is clearly in conflict with the view of the majority, in this instance a majority of four. It is a matter of balancing control and compassion. If the proposal of the majority is accepted it will balance compassion so far, in my view, as to outweigh the proper control that the immigration program of this country requires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with considerable pleasure that I speak in support of this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, Illegal Entrants in Australia-Balancing control and compassion, because it is the first that I have been involved with that has been presented to this House. I have long had an interest in migration, being a migrant myself. Whichever way one does it, migration is disruptive. As a nation chiefly of migrants and their descendants we should all be aware of this. For those who are not, I commend the very fine Australian play Their Country's Good on the formation of the Australian nation by involuntary migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some migrants come here illegally for reasons which vary as widely as they do themselves and at the start of this inquiry into their status I was strongly of the view that they should all be deported pretty well compulsorily without appeal and on detection. My reasoning was that this country has and needs a robust and orderly immigration program. If our electorates believe the program not to be within the Government's control they will withdraw public support for that program and, if the 90 per cent of the applicants for migration who are rejected believe that illegal entry can succeed, they will be tempted to take that route. </PARA>
<PARA> Illegal entrants, then, are an affront and a threat to the migration policy as a whole and to its orderly character in particular. I supported very tough actions against illegals and opposed in particular the repetition of the amnesties which were granted over a decade ago. As a result, the extremely tough proposals introduced in the legislation of last year seemed to me to be appropriate except for the abolition of ministerial discretion. I was and remain of the view that the total codification of the migration regulations was not appropriate. That was undertaken before I was in this House; so I accept its introduction and will try to make it work as best I can. </PARA>
<PARA> During our series of public hearings, which, as the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) pointed out, were very extensive, my views on the situation of illegal entrants shifted somewhat. Crucial in this transition of my point of view were the so-called innocent illegals to which both the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and the honourable member for Calwell have referred. Broadly speaking, these are people who have unknowingly acquired an illegal entrant status. We had a large number of examples of such circumstances presented to us. The ones I draw to the House's attention are those who have become unknowingly and unwittingly illegal because they entered as children and were in no position to discover it at that time-and some only find out when they apply for a passport-or women who, for whatever reason, have allowed their husbands to undertake the business of applying for migration to this country, for permanent resident status, and then discover that it was done badly in some way or another and they have acquired illegal entrant status unknowingly, unwittingly and unintentionally. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it was the consensus of the Committee that there are people who would be unwarrantedly harshly treated by the regime that it was proposed be introduced at the end of October. I concede that I started to look at other instances rather more sympathetically but always tried to do so against the background of the need to maintain the integrity of the immigration program and system as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> As the previous speaker pointed out, there are probably between 100,000 and 150,000 illegal entrants in Australia. If the proposed new regime is introduced on 1 November, a date which has already been postponed on a number of occasions, they will all be subject to mandatory deportation on detection. Until that date some relatively minor concessions already apply. I do not relish the prospect of the numerous deportations which will ensue from the extended personnel and financial resources which are to be deployed to enforce the new regime but I accept the necessity of doing this at a time of a growing problem of illegal entrance globally-and we are not the only country faced with it--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member mentions Canada. Canada, a similar country to our own, was investigated quite thoroughly and the honourable member is quite right in saying that Canada has acquired an illegal entrance problem of disturbing proportions. We have that problem to a much lesser extent. As a result I accept the harshness of the regime we intended to introduce in November as a firm but fair policy. A firm but fair policy is a decent policy; a harsh and unfair one is not. The bordering line is often difficult to determine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The majority of the Committee-and it was a majority voting at the time of the vote being taken-proposes in its report that innocent illegals be given particular appeal rights to regularise their status via a tribunal to the Minister, and be allowed to do it before and after 1 November. It also proposes that the same tribunal be able to receive before 31 October applications from other illegal entrants to regularise their status but to do so in accord with pretty strict qualifications. These concern compelling and compassionate circumstances, their own personal behaviour while they have been here-and, indeed, before they came here-the length of stay that they have had in Australia, and the circumstances of that stay. This would establish their ability to apply to the tribunal. These applicants would then be assessed on further criteria the nature of which assessment is essentially to determine whether their continued stay would serve the interests of the Australian community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous speaker talked about the number of persons that would be involved in this process and in the report we have estimated the figure to be of the order of 4,000. It is difficult to be any more precise than that because innocent illegals may not even know at the present time that they are illegal. The number of people who would qualify to apply cannot be accurately determined at this time but to the best of our knowledge 4,000 would be a reasonable figure to anticipate. Our advisers have suggested that even this is larger than would be the case and that 1,000 might be closer to the mark. </PARA>
<PARA> After the end of October the new, very severe regime could then proceed in its firm posture, having, via the system, offered the opportunity for the most compelling of illegal cases, including people who are innocently illegal and do not know they are in that situation, to regularise their status. The regime we propose then becomes firm but fair. Some of the Committee felt that this was too compassionate an approach and placed a greater emphasis on the need to maintain the total integrity of the immigration program as a whole. They wanted toughness maintained and would make the exception, in the case put by one honourable senator, only in the case of innocent illegals. I doubt, however, that they perceive the community reaction which is likely to be engendered by undue harshness in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Other Committee members, including the honourable member for Dundas, who spoke before me in this debate, accepted the tribunal but wanted different rules embodied. This may be an understandable position but its likely effect is to reduce the acceptability of the report by preventing a bipartisan consensus emerging. As a result the report is less likely to be implemented as a whole. This may well be their intention. Others again-outside the Committee but in public testimony-went much further, arguing for concessions including such things as amnesties which I believe would pose unacceptable threats to the integrity of the immigration program as a whole. I commend the report, with its appropriate balance, as its title suggests, of control and compassion, to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague reminds me that the expression is `where angels fear to tread'. It may be there that I am rushing. Nevertheless I, and, I think, many Australians, are justifiably concerned about the extent of illegal immigration into this country. I notice that the title of the report deals with the question of balancing control and compassion. I personally-and I feel that I would be speaking for many Australians-would want to come down strongly on the side of control and detection. It is the matter of detection that I want to deal with briefly this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was very pleased to hear my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), a member of the Committee, say that there was considerable dissent in respect of the Committee report. As I listened to the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) I became increasingly concerned about whether what he was saying was a view or position shared by many people other than himself. As it turns out it is now clear to me that there is considerable dissent in respect of this particular report. I found it rather quaint that we should talk of innocent illegals. It seems to be something of a contradiction in terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk about the question of detention. We all recognise-it appears that the Committee has recognised it-that the problem of illegal immigration is endemic in Australia. Whether we are talking about 90,000 or 150,000 people who are here illegally, it is a matter of some concern. Of particular concern to me is the number of those people who are entering on tourist visas and who are actually working in Australia. I believe that that is a matter that ought to concern a lot of people. If we are talking about 100,000 people who are in Australia illegally, there is a distinct possibility that a substantial proportion of those may actually be working here. If they are working here they are presumably doing work that could be done by people who are here legally or who are already Australian citizens. In other words, these illegals are replacing as many as 150,000 people in the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, we ought to be concerned that perhaps those 150,000 people who are here illegally are probably not paying taxes. Therefore, I hope that the Committee has come down strongly on the side of control in respect of this particular problem. I would like to suggest to the Committee-perhaps it is a bit late to ask it to consider these matters but I want to raise them and put them on the record-some practical ways in which this problem of detection can be addressed. It is not enough to have a few officers running around trying to find these illegal immigrants because the problem is so obviously out of control that we would have to have an enormous police force to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make three suggestions as to how, if we are serious about this problem, we can address it on a fairly simple administrative level. The first proposition is that we can deny illegal immigrants access to a tax file number. Secondly, we can redesign or restructure Commonwealth Employment Service procedures to ensure that those who are using those facilities are bona fide residents or citizens. Thirdly, we can ensure that drivers licences, which are by their very nature a de facto ID card, are issued only to legal residents or Australian citizens. In respect of the tax file number it is quite clear that, with no access to a tax file number, de facto ID or drivers licence and no ability to gain access to unemployment benefits, illegal residency in Australia will be very much less attractive to these people than it apparently is at the moment. In fact, they may find life here rather difficult if they are unable to work here. </PARA>
<PARA> A by-product and another concern regarding the tightening up of administrative procedures in respect of these matters is that these people would also have greater difficulty in gaining credit. This is another thing that they can do quite readily. That also creates a problem for people who give credit to them by virtue of the fact that they front up with a drivers licence which they can gain very readily. I suppose at worst-I say at worst because it is a worst option-if we were serious about this problem we may gain extra tax revenue because people working illegally without a tax file number will be taxed at the highest level, and I assume that they will not come forward to claim a tax refund. At least at worst there are some benefits in that particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to the application for a tax file number. It has some serious deficiencies. Firstly, the documents that one is asked to present when one applies for a tax file number are not difficult to procure. One has to present two category A documents. It is not difficult, if one reads the application form, to find that one has only to find a degree, a school examination certificate or a school examination report and combine that with a document such as a registered mortgage, title or deeds to real estate. Quite simply, on an administrative level the tightening up of that particular application form will in part address this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The other glaring weakness that exists in respect of this application is that there is no requirement for photographic evidence. Surely, it is not too difficult to expect people applying for a tax file number to produce a photograph of themselves. If they were to do so, that would address some of the concerns that I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the procedures of the Commonwealth Employment Service are concerned, it is fairly apparent that it has no concern with this problem. Perhaps it is not necessarily its responsibility. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it has only to ask three questions of people who come before it to play a part in addressing this problem. Firstly, `Were you born in Australia?'. Secondly, `If not, can you produce evidence that you are a legal resident or that you have actually achieved Australian citizenship?'. Thirdly, 'Are you allowed to work in Australia?'. It could ask people who answer that question affirmatively to produce evidence that they are allowed, within the terms of their visas, to work in Australia. The same sorts of questions ought to be asked in respect of people applying for drivers licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The criticism may well be levelled that all this adds to the administrative burdens in these particular areas. I believe that the problem is of such magnitude and concern to most Australians that if we are serious about solving this problem we should take up some of the suggestions that I have made and see whether we can go about reducing illegal immigration in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While there are many things I could say about this report, I appreciate the fact that agreements have been made about speakers lists and the business of the day, and I do not want to upset them any further. However, for quite some time I was Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations and, in view of some of the things that have been said in the debate, I want to make a couple of quick remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One must be extremely careful when talking about compassion and amnesties for illegal immigrants. There are very occasional circumstances where somebody is genuinely what one could call an innocent illegal. In my 16 years in Parliament I have had a very close involvement with many difficult immigration cases and I think these occasional cases readily identify themselves. When one makes a full investigation of all the circumstances of cases where people claim that they genuinely believed they had the right sort of visa to come here as migrants, or that they had really given the right information, one finds that genuine circumstances do reveal themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our difficulties at the moment is that, under the new regime, the migration law is extremely complex and very difficult to follow because of these regulations that we now have. Therefore, it is just that little bit more possible to be genuinely an innocent illegal. This is not quite the contradiction in terms that it sounds. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am strongly at variance with the comments of the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), who said that we need a more compassionate approach to illegals. One should be extremely cautious of the word `compassion' in the immigration debate. When I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, I was one of the members who pushed very strongly for the compassionate factor in consideration of migration applications in those cases where there was a real compassion factor. We were successful in getting a small move in the regulations which does allow consideration, under very stringent conditions, of strong compassionate circumstances for those applying for migration. This is not the same thing as applying those conditions to somebody who comes here on a visitor's visa of some sort and then applies for a change of status. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to mount what one can loosely call a case for compassion. If it can be mounted, usually it can be mounted before the person comes here. It should not be left until that person is here so that he or she can then play on the heartstrings-usually of the general Australian public-via the mass media of newspapers and certain television programs which conveniently give a very one-eyed story just for the sake of today's newspaper or today's program. Therefore, whilst it may be appropriate in the normal course of immigration to have the compassionate let out, basically it is not appropriate for illegals. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had many involvements with people who were under deportation orders who wanted some help, and I have to say I have encountered very few genuine cases. Marginal cases-and some very sad cases can arise here-usually involve people having come here on some sort of visa, decided they really like the place and stayed. They would have made good migrants had they applied in the normal way. When they are detected several years later, they have homes they have to sell and all sorts of other problems from which they have to extricate themselves. They have to get out of the country and cannot apply to come back for years. When you say to them, `For heaven's sake, why did you not apply to migrate and do it the right way?', they reply that they had heard there was to be an amnesty. If there is one way to ask for a disaster in an immigration program it is to let people think there will be amnesties. The statement that was put out on the last amnesty, jointly by the then Minister for immigration and the shadow Minister for immigration, stated that it was to be the last. If we are ever to have proper control over our immigration program, we have to stick with that statement made several years ago and have no more amnesties in this country; otherwise we will just end up with a shambles. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had numerous experiences, as I am sure have other members, of people who have become unfortunate illegals-unfortunate in the sense that they could have mounted a compassionate case. But they knew that they were illegal and that they could have come here in the right way and not caused heartache to other people. Nevertheless, they thought that somebody was going to be soft on them some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I support what the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) says, that we need that small window for cases where there has been inadvertence, for example where somebody has misunderstood the directions that have been given by one of our posts overseas or something like that. But compassion is generally not the right word to use in such cases. Furthermore, we must never again have an immigration amnesty. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received the following message from the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate requests the House of Representatives to resume consideration of the Bill entitled a Bill for an Act to Establish an End of War List for Australian Service Personnel, which was transmitted to the House of Representatives for its concurrence on 2 November 1989 during the last session of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The message I have just reported raises a fundamental issue of parliamentary procedure which I must bring to the attention of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> By a message dated 2 November 1989 the Senate transmitted for the concurrence of the House the End of War List Bill 1989. On 21 November 1989 the message was reported to the House by the Chair, the Bill was read a first time and a motion for the second reading was moved by the present Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). Debate on the motion was then adjourned. The Bill, together with all other outstanding business of the House, lapsed with the dissolution of the Houses on 19 February 1990 prior to the general election for the House of Representatives and the half Senate election which was held on 24 March 1990. The simple position, therefore, is that neither the End of War List Bill 1989 nor any other Bill on the Notice Paper at the time of dissolution on 19 February is now an item of business before the House of Representatives in the Thirty-sixth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The message which the Senate has now sent asks the House to resume consideration of the lapsed Bill which was transmitted to the House, in the words of the Senate message, 'during the last session of the Parliament'. I highlight the words 'during the last session of the Parliament' because the Bill was not transmitted during the last session of this Parliament but during the session of the last Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> The action by the Senate has been taken despite the provisions of Senate standing order 136, to which the House of Representatives standing order 264 is similar, which effectively forbids consideration of a Bill being resumed following a general election or a periodical election for the Senate. I should point out that the Senate suspended its Standing Orders to validate the action it has taken-that is, to enable the message to be sent to the House requesting that we resume consideration of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> Although it is unusual for a Speaker to question the actions of the Senate, I feel that on this occasion I should do so on the ground that the Senate has involved the House of Representatives by its actions. First, it may be argued that suspension of Standing Orders to enable this particular action of the Senate, while of undoubted validity, ignores proper parliamentary practice.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, those who drew up our Standing Orders included a provision for a Bill which lapsed at the prorogation of the session to be restored to the Notice Paper under certain conditions but they specifically excluded such action if an election intervened, as I mentioned earlier. The word `prorogation' as used in the Standing Orders should be read as `dissolution' in this particular circumstance, as a practice of having a prorogation prior to a dissolution is no longer followed and so, these days, the business of the House lapses at the end of a parliament, because of dissolution rather than prorogation.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason behind the prohibition in the standing order is that a new House should not be bound by the actions of its predecessor in so far as unfinished business is concerned because there is a new membership in the House-and indeed a new Ministry. In fact, the last election saw the return of 33 new members to this House, almost a quarter of the whole membership of the House. It should also be noted that the Senate also has a new membership which has not considered the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> In raising this matter I emphasise that I am not expressing a view on the substance of the Bill itself. My comments are confined entirely to the question of the procedures of the House of Representatives and I have an obligation to advise the House of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Bill is not before the House and the message which I have just reported does not transmit the Bill to the House. If the Senate desires the House to consider the Bill, it needs to find a mechanism to bring it before the House which is not contrary to the provisions of House of Representatives standing order 264 and proper parliamentary procedure.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly it is suggested that, if the Senate desires to revive the Bill, it should introduce the Bill again and transmit it to the House for concurrence in accordance with normal procedures. To this end I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free) to move a motion rejecting the Senate request.</PARA>
<PARA> Ordered that the message be taken into consideration forthwith.</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Free) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House of Representatives, having considered Senate message number 48 requesting the House to resume consideration of the Bill entitled a Bill for an Act to Establish an End of War List for Australian Service Personnel, resolves that a message be sent to the Senate stating that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the request is irregular in that it seeks to have the House resume consideration of a Bill which lapsed at the dissolution of the House of Representatives and in respect of which the resumption of proceedings is effectively prevented by the standing orders of the House and accepted parliamentary practice;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the House does not intend to resume consideration of the Bill as requested; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) if the Senate desires the House of Representatives to consider the Bill, it is suggested that the Senate should introduce it again and transmit it to the House for concurrence in accordance with normal procedures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion. I would point out that this important Bill, the End of War List Bill 1989, has been derailed by a quite proper point of parliamentary procedure arising from the most recent Federal elections, which involved both half the Senate and the entirety of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of background, the Bill was originally introduced into the Senate by the then National Party Senator Julian McGauran with the specific objective of providing an end of war list for those who served in the Vietnam war. Other conflicts such as World War I and World War II were the subject of an end of war list. Indeed, an end of war list was recommended in relation to the Vietnam war but not proceeded with by the government of the day in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> That legislation subsequently passed the Senate. It enjoyed support on both sides of the Senate and proceeded down to the House of Representatives, where I introduced the measure. The Bill was not fully debated because the Government did not find the time for it to be fully debated prior to the last Federal election in March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Then the Senate decided to have another look at this Bill and subsequently passed a formal motion, rather than undertaking a proper consideration of the Bill through the first, second and third reading stages. The formal motion, which was supported by Government senators, was moved by Senator Boswell and invited the House to resume consideration of the Bill from the point where we left off prior to the dissolution of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, both the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and I have carefully considered this subject in the time available arising from your intimation of this matter. We have concluded that it would be entirely desirable, and indeed, most proper in terms of parliamentary practice and convention, that both the Senate and the House, as comprised for the Thirty-sixth Parliament, should properly deal with this and each and every other measure during the life of this Parliament. Of course, that process would require the proper procedures for the first, second and third reading stages and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to delay the House, because I know there are a number of tightly-timed maiden speeches scheduled through the rest of this day, but I would remind the House that Vietnam veterans regard this Bill as of great importance. There are practical difficulties in effecting this end of war list, but it did enjoy the support, effectively, of many on both sides of the House and the Senate, Government senators and indeed members of the Liberal and National parties. It is a piece of legislation which I hope will come to fruition as a result of the Senate once again going through the procedure and representing it to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion presented to the House by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free) clearly invites the Senate to reintroduce the Bill, consider it and transmit it to the House of Representatives for concurrence in accordance with normal procedures. In a sense, on a technicality, but an important technicality, the Bill has been derailed. </PARA>
<PARA> None of us are very happy about that because we would have liked to have seen this Bill proceeded with and adopted and this sin of omission rectified so far as Vietnam veterans are concerned. They have had a hard road to hoe. I suppose I can allow that I might be a little biased, being one of a couple of Vietnam veterans who are members of this House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the Opposition supports the motion moved by the Parliamentary Secretary to send a message back to the Senate inviting the Senate in fact to reconsider this matter through the normal stages in accordance with all that is required and meant for the proper practice of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the 1990 Budget before the Parliament confirms our worst fears. The Government has lost any semblance of courage, of leadership and, indeed, of vision. The Budget is all about lowest common denominator factional politics-what is acceptable to people beyond the Parliament, what might or might not be acceptable to the special Labor Party conference due on 24 September, and what might be acceptable or not acceptable to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which had plenty to say about what was not acceptable about the Telecom decision made yesterday by this Government. I note the ACTU is represented in the gallery this day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many respects the Australian economy can best be described as the Titanic. I do not mean titanic as in large, but rather I am referring to that splendid vessel which sank so disastrously earlier this century. This Budget is all about tinkering on the Titanic, and the designer of the Australian Titanic, the Australian economy, is the Federal Treasurer (Mr= Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> Like the naval architects who designed the SS Titanic, the Treasurer has designed his own Titanic based on flawed assumptions. The designer of the SS Titanic assumed that the strength of the ship's hull and its watertight compartments would make it unsinkable. The Treasurer has continued to assume much the same in relation to the economy. However, the reality is that by virtue of this Budget, the Treasurer has set a course which, simply stated, is all about `steady as she sinks'. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I thank the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) for pointing out that Australia is moving in that particular direction, because that is where the Australian ship of state, the Australian economy, is heading; this Budget is all about `steady as she sinks'. </PARA>
<PARA> My experience in travelling across the length and breadth of Australia in recent times is that we are fast reaching the point where our normally resilient economy, our normally resilient farmers, miners, small business operators and blue-collar workers can take it no longer. There is massive economic agony across Australia reflected by increased bankruptcies, higher unemployment and even increased use of food vouchers issued by such organisations as the Salvation Army. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. There is another category, where they are not actually bankrupt, but where small business operators are simply closing their doors and walking away from their small business operation because of the rapid and massive economic downturn impacting across so much of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's economic policies are in many ways to blame for this. Its other policies, where it has tinkered, where it has dawdled on key decisions, are also to blame. Like the SS Titanic, the Australian economy is in danger of sinking without a trace. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be one man who will bear the burden of responsibility for this disaster, and that is the Treasurer. I say to the House that on 28 July 1990 the Treasurer did liken the economy to a ship. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>You know, when you turn the economy around it is like turning around a big ship. You turn the wheel and a long way further the vessel starts to turn. </PARA>
<PARA>The trouble with the Treasurer's ship is that it is a case of `steady as she sinks'. It is not turning; it is sinking, and it is sinking rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> The most telling criticism of the 1990 Budget is that there was an opportunity to address these problems. What was needed were policies which would bring down inflation, bring down the value of the Australian dollar and allow interest rates to trend down sustainably. The opportunity was lost as the Treasurer dished out more of the same and, indeed, with a sting in the tail. Let us look at one particular aspect: the question of an anti-inflation policy contained in this Budget. People who live in New South Wales and consume gas might be interested to know that buried in the detail of this Budget is a commitment by the Federal Government to legislate for not one but two 25 per cent increases in the tariff on gas moving along the pipeline from the field at Moomba to Sydney. That tariff is to be legislated for totally contrary to an existing agreement between Australian Gas Light Co. and the Pipeline Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse still, the Government has issued a letter, which I am happy to read part of to the House today, in which it insists that `with the passage of this legislation, you will be required to pass on the two lots of 25 per cent increases to the consumers'. Let me quote exactly. It comes from the Government Task Force on Asset Sales of the Department of Finance:</PARA>
<PARA>AGL will be required to pass on in full these increases in haulage tariffs to gas consumers but will be free to decide for itself just how this might be done. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to this aspect of the Budget, two legislated-for increases of 25 per cent in this tariff do nothing for the Government's anti-inflation policy. The coalition will be examining this legislation very carefully when it comes forward. Indeed, there is a hole in the middle of the Budget, and I acknowledge the description by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) that it is a doughnut Budget. It is lacking in any substantial progress on micro-economic reform and, indeed, on privatisation, notwithstanding the most recent developments. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the Budget I would like to highlight to the House that for the first time total revenue to the Commonwealth Government will exceed $100 billion. In fact, the Budget provides for an all time record revenue of $101.1 billion and an expenditure of $93 billion and, therefore, a surplus of $8.1 billion. Income tax payments continue to rise in gross amounts. Let me highlight the extent of these income tax rises, notwithstanding so-called income tax cuts from next January. Overall revenue from income tax is expected to rise from $50 billion to $54.3 billion, an increase of 8.7 per cent in gross income tax takings. When we include company tax, superannuation funds taxation, withholding tax, resource rent tax and fringe benefits tax, we have a total increase of revenue in this broadly defined category from $65.4 billion to $69.8 billion, an increase of 6.7 per cent on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's revenue figure in the Budget-some $101 billion overall-comprises some $70 billion from income tax broadly defined, whereas only $19.7 billion comes from indirect taxes such as sales tax, petroleum excise and customs import duty. I might add that this still represents a massive taxation burden, particularly for fuel users, for example, and especially those who are using fuel in respect of export industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Federal Budgets of recent years have affirmed a massive tilt towards direct tax payments, particularly individual income tax, with less reliance on indirect taxation. That is why blue-collar workers are walking out of trade unions in such large numbers, why the membership of trade unions has declined in so many industries. In fact they are being slugged, and that is why so many blue-collar workers are very unhappy with the income tax system and the marginal rates that exist today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look back. In 1985-86 income tax accounted for 65.9 per cent of the revenue base of the Federal Budget. Today it comprises over 70 per cent-in fact, around 72 per cent of the revenue base of this Budget. In this context, I point out to the House that the Treasurer said on 9 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia faces a clear choice. It either does something about the high marginal rates impacting on average weekly earnings and finds another base in the tax system or it does not, but we must stop dealing with symptoms. The tax laws are in need of radical surgery. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the Treasurer, Paul Keating. He went on to say, on 4 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to reduce the current over-reliance on the income tax base. This would result in a manifestly fairer tax system and would create the foundations for a more efficient system to promote stronger economic growth and higher living standards. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have the Treasurer, back there in 1985, arguing for a shift in the tax base of the Budget, but we have a Budget before the House today which reaffirms the massive reliance on income tax from individuals, effectively sucking out enterprise and initiative and reward for effort in a way which is clearly denting the performance of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say that there is an alternative, and this is what I want to dwell on: the clear-cut choice being offered by the coalition with regard to this aspect of taxation. The Liberal and National parties have adopted the goods and services tax (GST) package which I want to detail. It provides for, firstly, the total abolition of the present inefficient and unfair system of wholesale sales tax; secondly, the introduction of a broadly based goods and services tax; thirdly, the provision of a rebate from the goods and services tax on all business imports and a zero rating of exports; fourthly, the provision of rebates on GST on fuels used in business and farming; fifthly, provision of compensation packaged to include low income earners, pensioners and others; and sixthly, finally and very importantly, significant and substantial personal income tax cuts flowing from our goods and services tax package. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the clear-cut alternative for the tax structure of this country. We have had the courage to bite the bullet and to provide a very real alternative which will put incentive back into our economy. It will do one other thing: it will abolish the $1 billion to $2 billion of indirect taxes currently being applied to our export industries in a crippling way at a very difficult time for export performance, given the value of the Australian dollar and the related value of Australian interest rates. We have made a commitment to abolish totally the wholesale sales tax regime with all its anomalies. It taxes at 20 per cent a blue-collar worker with his tool box heading off to Mount Isa Mines but does not tax anyone heading into Parliament House wearing an Italian suit in terms of sales tax-and so many more anomalies could be given. We will abolish completely that wholesale sales tax and, in so doing, we will provide a system which puts our exporters on a similar footing to 21 out of the 24 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. At the moment they are being penalised by from $1 billion to $2 billion by the current hopeless system of taxation provided for once again in this Budget. There is a clear-cut choice, a clear-cut alternative on the matter of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we also have a clear-cut alternative on privatisation, and I want to dwell on Telecom. The Government is stranded on privatisation. It is paralysed. It has gone for the lowest common denominator politics-factional politics, conference controlled politics, and I note all those who are present in the chamber at this time. On the matter of Telecom let me say to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that, in effect, what he argued for this afternoon was the backdoor sleazy method of provision of cross-subsidisation to facilitate some Telecom activity across country Australia and, indeed, in city Australia. The community service obligation (CSO) does not relate just to provincial Australia, remote Australia and regional Australia; it also relates to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and beyond. It is a very important question. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition decided as a clear-cut choice to identify that community service obligation once and for all and to do so fairly. At the moment Telecom does not credit the rural network with all the income it raises and, consequently, the CSO figure is much larger than it actually might be. But we have given a commitment to identify that community service obligation. We have given a commitment and accept that the Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure a comprehensive network across Australia. We also accept that that should be done at a reasonable cost. The alternative, under the Government's decision yesterday, is that we are going to continue with a backdoor method of cross-subsidisation. We are going to continue to provide for that by bureaucratic fiefdom, by decision of bureaucrats. I can point to towns around Australia which have ancient automatic telephone exchanges, which have enormous difficulties under the approach by this Government over the last seven years, and which are not in a sense getting a fair chop out of the current CSO situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have taken a more courageous and honest approach. We are going to quantify that, provide for it, put it up front in the Budget-and that is as it should be. I will not accept any system which will lessen the quality and fairness of access of rural and regional Australians to an adequate communications system. They must have that access at reasonable cost over the long haul of the 1990s and, given all the changes taking place in this decade, it is the approach to that issue taken by the coalition which has a better chance of delivering such a service and making it accountable to both the Parliament and the nation than the somewhat sleazy backdoor method that the Minister for Transport and Communications recommends. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and final area where we offer a clear-cut choice compared to what is offered in the Budget before the House-a Budget which is all about tinkering on the Titanic-is the area of uranium policy. For several years, the Government has pursued the hypocritical policy of three mines which, following the recent closure of one mine in the Northern Territory, has in fact come back to a one-mine policy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) goes round saying, `You cannot govern the country if you cannot govern yourselves'. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said the other day on the matter of uranium policy that it drags on and on because the Australian Labor Party cannot take a decision. Here is an admission, from the Prime Minister's own lips and confirmed by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that the Government cannot govern the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy went on to say that the Government's current policy states that uranium should not be mined but also that uranium should be mined. So the Government is completely and utterly hypocritical as regards its two- or three-mine policy. The Government ought to own up and have the courage to put the issue on the agenda for the special conference. A special committee has been looking at this issue for over two years. The honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) is involved with that committee. Perhaps that is the reason that the committee has not got around to producing some form of report, or perhaps its attempts at producing a report have been vetoed. The Government has had over two years to put that report forward, take it to the special conference and resolve its major problem over uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not often follow what Mr R. Hogg has to say, but he greatly impressed me on Sunday morning when he suggested that the Government had been wrong on its uranium policy and that its policy was inconsistent. Mr R. Hogg, who is a left-winger par excellence and perhaps someone that the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) is happy to be closely associated with, said that the mining policy of the Government is inconsistent. I will spare the Minister on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has a very stark choice. We face a desperate economic situation throughout the 1990s. This decade has started with economic agony unfolding right across the nation. The challenge for the Government was to come up with a Budget which made the fundamental decisions necessary to provide vision and leadership for this country and to review those policies which it knows in its heart it has got wrong. The Government's uranium policy is one of those policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We offer a clear-cut alternative with regard to uranium, which is simply that the artificial restrictions as proposed by Labor policy should be withdrawn. Our policy provides for the removal of the veto on new uranium mines. In fact, mining and the export of uranium will be permitted subject to environmental controls and strict international safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has 28 per cent of the low cost uranium reserves. The left wing and others on the Government side would like to see that remain locked up when countries in Europe require over 70 per cent nuclear power in order to generate electricity so as to stop people from dying from cold in the winter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pride that I rise to address the House today as the fourth elected representative of the electorate of Banks. Since it was created in 1949, the seat of Banks has always returned a Labor member to this House. I am deeply honoured to take my seat in this House as a member of the Australian Labor Party. History has shown that the Labor Party is the only party committed to social justice and equality. The people of Banks believe, as I do, that a Labor government is the only government which governs in the interests of all Australians. They share the same hopes and aspirations as most Australians and look to their elected representatives to fight for an equal and fairer society which offers security for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am the first Labor representative from Banks to make his maiden speech from the Government benches. I chose not to make my maiden speech in reply to the Governor-General's Speech because I will not, nor should any Australian, forget the treacherous events of 11 November 1975. It will always be remembered as a black day in our history when democracy was cast aside and the sovereignty of this chamber usurped. </PARA>
<PARA> My main concern is people, not profits. Governments have an essential role in creating a just and equitable society. I believe in government regulation and intervention, for without it the inequalities inherent in our society will continue to flourish. Governments are elected to govern, not to sit back and be spectators. The disciples of free market economics believe that there is no place for government intervention in the market-place. These economic rationalists show no concern for people and are driven solely by profit and greed. Their unshakeable faith in market forces is testimony to a corrupt ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980s has been a decade of excess and wasted opportunities. We have seen the unprecedented accumulation and concentration of wealth, all in the name of free enterprise. The irresponsibility and damage caused by corporate cowboys is just now becoming apparent. The high flying entrepreneurs of the 1980s, who prospered at society's expense and proceeded to flaunt their new-found wealth, have either disappeared or are in their death throes. Society does not mourn their passing but is burdened with their funeral expenses. Australia cannot afford to be taken on a roller-coaster ride with mavericks who are concerned solely with their own interests. Yet these corporate cowboys have the audacity to claim that they are working in the national interest, that their interests and the national interest are somehow one and the same. Their empty rhetoric has been exposed for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged that from 1 January 1991 Australia will for the first time have a single corporate regulatory authority, the Australian Securities Commission, and that this Budget provides for additional resources of $210m over the next four years to be devoted to regulation of companies and securities. For too long big business has been allowed to run wild. No longer will corporate excesses be tolerated. Australians have underestimated the cost of corporate crime to our nation. An individual who steals $20 is dealt with more severely by the legal system than is a company which has deliberately defrauded its shareholders and the Government of millions of dollars. It is obscene that some of our largest companies are paying as little as 5c in the dollar in tax, yet the people who own and manage those companies have the gall continually to call on government to cut back spending on social welfare, since they believe the recipients of these benefits to be an unnecessary burden on society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious who is rorting the system. The bottom of the harbour tax avoidance schemes, which were encouraged under the Fraser Government, have come back in more elaborate forms: tax havens in the Cook Islands, $2 holding companies, low interest loans to directors-the list goes on. Creative accounting is a polite term for cooking the books. This Government is firm in its resolve to stamp out tax avoidance by the corporate sector. It is time those who can afford to pay paid their fair share. Our opponents across the chamber, who live in an economic fantasy land, have done nothing but continually undermine the efforts of the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to ensure that wage and salary justice is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> In difficult economic circumstances, wage and salary earners have shown considerable restraint. They have done so in the national interest. The Opposition's record on industrial relations is pathetic. Its approach to industrial relations belongs in the Dark Ages. Confrontation rather than consultation is its strategy. It has no respect for the working men and women of Australia and has opposed every initiative designed to benefit those in the workplace. Through the dark years of the Fraser Government our opponents argued that workers' wages should not be indexed to offset the increased cost of living. Time after time at national wage case hearings the Fraser Government submitted that workers should not receive any increases. As inflation continued to soar, real wages kept diminishing. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservative forces have nothing to offer Australia but false hopes and a bad smell. One need look only at the Greiner Government's track record, which in the space of 30 months has managed to break in excess of 160 promises. It is a government without compassion and totally lacking in integrity. Conservative policies are based on division and attacking the poor and disadvantaged sections of the community. The proposal to introduce a consumption tax will further disadvantage those who are most in need of assistance. A consumption tax will do nothing to help achieve social justice and equity. It is a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> When history passes judgment on this Labor Government it will note as one of its greatest achievements the creation of 1.7 million jobs since March 1983. In stark contrast is the abysmal record of our conservative opponents who, between December 1975 and March 1983, watched idly as unemployment rose from 209,000 to 625,000. There can be no more graphic illustration of what it is that separates us from our opponents. The Fraser Government was content to put more than 400,000 people out of work, whilst the Hawke Government created 1.7 million new jobs and reduced unemployment. It is not in our nation's interest to have its most valuable resource lying idle. In his policy speech of 1949 Ben Chifley said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is the duty and responsibility of the community and particularly those more fortunately placed, to see that our less fortunate citizens are protected from those shafts of fate which leave them helpless and without hope. That is the objective for which we are striving. It is the beacon, the light on the hill to which our eyes are always turned and to which our efforts are always directed. </PARA>
<PARA>Gough Whitlam stated in his policy speech in 1969:</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Party has an enduring commitment to create opportunities for all citizens. The opportunity for a complete education, opportunity for dignity in retirement, opportunity for proper medical treatment, opportunity to share the nation's wealth and resources, opportunity for decent housing, the opportunity for civilised conditions in our cities and our towns, opportunity to preserve and promote the natural beauty of the land. </PARA>
<PARA>These ideals remain just as valid today. They are the foundation stone of Labor's social justice strategy. Economic circumstances may have changed, but the ideals espoused by great men, such as Chifley and Whitlam, must not be abandoned. The road to reform is not an easy one, but these ideals are worth fighting for. I joined the Australian Labor Party in 1974 because I was attracted by the vision articulated by Gough Whitlam. The Whitlam Government, sadly, was a brief one. Many of the reforms so bitterly opposed at the time by our opponents are still with us and have become an integral part of Australian life. It was a government which raised hopes and expectations and lifted the horizons of the people. Programs have been modified to cater for changed economic circumstances, but the emphasis has not been lost. All major initiatives designed to promote social equality have been undertaken by the Labor Party. The need for and importance of a national health scheme was first recognised by Labor. The creation of Medicare is but one example of Labor's ongoing commitment to achieving social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government did all it could to dismantle Medibank and deprive Australians of affordable health cover. There can be no equality in a society that does not provide quality and affordable health services to its people. So, too, should all people be given access to higher education. Education should not be the domain of the rich, but should be available for all. The Whitlam Government recognised the importance of education, and this Government has continued Labor's commitment to higher education by ensuring that an extra 70,000 positions will have been created between 1988 and 1993. Increased retention rates in high schools are further testimony to Labor's commitment to education. In 1982 only 36 per cent of young people stayed on through high school. This has increased to more than 60 per cent in 1990 and the Government is seeking to increase this to 65 per cent by 1992. We are all diminished when any one of us is denied proper education. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in the nation's interest that the elderly are properly catered for in retirement. Labor's retirement incomes policy is directed at ensuring dignity in retirement. From women's issues to the environment, Labor has always been committed to making Australia a fairer and more compassionate society. </PARA>
<PARA> On this special occasion I would like to acknowledge those who have supported me over the years. Both my parents were born in Barhalyoun, Lebanon. I am proud of my Lebanese heritage and look forward to the day when peace returns to Lebanon. My family has lived in the electorate at Panania for more than 60 years. My father, Samuel, migrated to Australia from Lebanon with his family in 1926. He was 12 years old. He was a bootmaker and then a market gardener who instilled in me the value of a good education and the importance of treating all people with respect. At the time of my father's death, my mother, Maria, who is with me today, was left to raise 10 children-all of whom were still at school or university. Words cannot express the enormous debt of gratitude I owe her. She serves as an inspiration to all who know her. </PARA>
<PARA> My family has been an integral part of my success. I wish to place on record my appreciation to my brothers, Jacob, Raymond, Joseph, Anyce, Louis, Christopher and Simon, and my sisters, Myrna and Fay. I also wish to acknowledge the support and guidance of my late uncle Tony and his wife, Fay, and that of my late grandmother, Annie. </PARA>
<PARA> My elevation to Parliament has been a long struggle. This would have been my third term had obstacles not been placed before me by the party machine in New South Wales. I would never have made it to this House had it not been for the solid and unwavering support I received over many years from the rank and file of the Australian Labor Party in the Banks electorate. I am honoured that so many of my friends and the local party membership have made the effort to be here today to share this occasion with me. Their presence in the gallery stands as testimony to the enthusiasm and interest which are generated when the local Labor Party membership is permitted to participate in the decision-making process. To those present and the many others unable to be here, I say,`I thank you all for your time, energy and effort'. The result in Banks on 24 March was not my victory, but our victory. </PARA>
<PARA> My most loyal supporter throughout my long struggle was Judy Bail, who never lost faith in me or what I believed in. Her determination and capacity for hard work could never be underestimated. Assisting Judy all the way were Lucy Burrell and Maurice Campbell. The time and effort invested by these three people over a number of years could not be calculated. It is due largely to their perseverance that I stand here today. </PARA>
<PARA> My campaign director, Phillip Boulten, and I went through university together and have remained close friends ever since. He is a person whom I greatly admire and he has never deviated from his beliefs. He has always acted with honesty and integrity and has served as an inspiration to me. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to acknowledge the continuing support provided by my fellow directors of the Revesby Workers Club. Bill Bullard, as President, has always been there to offer assistance, while John Gibbons, Keith Heaslip, Vic Pavlick, Ron Polley and Norma Smith have all been generous in their support. As Secretary/Manager, Brien Higgs has been a good friend. To the management, staff and members of the Revesby Workers Club, I offer my sincere thanks. I am proud to be Vice-President of such a great club which has a history and tradition of providing service to the community. It serves as a model to other clubs throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My campaign was assisted by a number of people, but special thanks must be given to Chris Osborne and Graham Rooke who took time off work to assist me. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already stated, mine has not been an easy struggle. My quest for endorsement has been protracted and, at times, bitter. I have prevailed because of the loyal support of my rank and file. Special thanks must go to Michael Finnane and Ray McCormack for their guidance and support over the years. I cannot ignore the support offered to me by Senator John Faulkner and Martin Ferguson. I value their friendship and consider myself fortunate to have two such friends. I am pleased about the election of Martin Ferguson as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and am confident that, under his guidance, the ACTU will continue to play a positive role in ensuring that we live in a fairer, more equitable society. </PARA>
<PARA> For more than a decade before entering parliament, I worked, firstly, as a public solicitor with the Legal Aid Commission and then as a barrister and public defender in New South Wales. To Peter Hidden, QC, and the public defenders; to Ron Newham and his staff at the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales, I say,`It was an honour working with you'. I have yet to encounter a more dedicated and professional group of people. Keep fighting, justice demands it. </PARA>
<PARA> My role in the legal system was that of an advocate for those people who did not have the resources to defend themselves. In this House I will continue to be an advocate for justice and a better world for those who cannot fight for themselves. Whether my stay in this chamber is short or long, I am not prepared to act merely as a seat warmer. I intend to be an active and accessible member and will continue to fight on behalf of the people who sent me here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask that you pass on my congratulations to the Speaker on his re-election to such a responsible position and also my thanks to the officers of the House who participated in the new members' seminar that was held recently at the opening of this Parliament. I am most grateful for the time taken by honourable members on both sides of the House and by their spouses, and I thank them for giving of their time so willingly in order to enhance my ability to effect my responsibility as a member of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I congratulate the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) on his maiden speech, but I remind the honourable member that today's use of the term 'social justice', which he used at the beginning of his speech, comes from, and was first mentioned by, the Right Honourable Robert Gordon Menzies on the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Liberal Party. I thank the honourable member for drawing it to the attention of the House today. </PARA>
<PARA> I enter this House acknowledging that I am here by the grace of God, and I pray for His blessing upon all honourable members in their work on behalf of this great nation. It is a privilege and an honour to participate in this great institution of parliamentary democracy and I accept the responsibility of serving the constituents of Corinella and, in the broader sense, the people of Australia. I said 'by the grace of God' because I know of no other person who was a candidate in 1984 and again in 1987 and who joined this House in 1990 as a new member. I have been through five preselections-and anybody who has been through five Liberal Party preselections can understand what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people took great pleasure in my victory in Corinella; not least being the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson). I have had the pleasure of working alongside these honourable members for a considerable time-some six years-and I have gained invaluable experience from them. To Petro Giorgiou and his team in Victoria, I say, `Thank you for your outstanding contribution to my campaign'. My thanks go to the Victorian State members for their unified efforts and to those who have stuck with me through nearly 10 years of elections-including local government elections, preselections and Federal elections. I especially thank my wife, Bronwyn, who is in the gallery today and seated with her, Merilyn MacGregor and Lorraine Wilksch, who are friends who have been through all those times with us. </PARA>
<PARA> I send a message of thanks to Emily Broadbent and the boys, Evand and Paul, who this week are on camp with the Pakenham Consolidated School and the Pakenham Secondary School. I am sure they will be listening. However, I want to send a special message to the partners of volunteers. I refer to those volunteers we recognise in the fire brigades, the mothers' clubs and in all the other facets of voluntary organisations in Australia. We know that Australia would stop dead if those volunteers stopped tomorrow. However, all those volunteers have partners who stay home night after night. Some members of the House have said to me that it is the pits being married to a Federal or State member, whether it be the husband or the wife. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the message needs to go out to those people, especially from this Party, that we appreciate their contribution in staying home and looking after those issues at home when others are out-when the fire siren goes and you are called out. That is important to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Three people who deserve special thanks in regard to my election are Glenys Gunther, Ruth Simon and Joan Reid. Their depth of knowledge, talent and unfailing confidence proved invaluable. I wish to say `thank you very much' and to express my gratitude for the kindness shown to me by my family; the people of the Kooweerup swampland; the Shire of Pakenham; the Westernport Development Council; the Dandenong Valley Authority; the Mornington Peninsula and District Water Board; the Pakenham Water Board-where I was first introduced to sewage in a big way; the people at Minibah and to all those disabled people whom I have been lucky enough to have been associated with and learn so much from over the past eight years as president of the organisation associated with that group. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those people shared in the victory but none shared in the victory as much as Lenny McGill and the boys from the Trutones and their families. Although that will not mean much to the House, to many Victorians I would be better known as the lead singer of the Trutones Showband. If I knock on a door during an election campaign, I normally say, `I am the candidate for Corinella'-as I was last time. However, I would be told, `No, you are not. You are the singer with the Trutones'. So I would have to address people in that fashion. But I did command the vote in the last election and that is the main thing. </PARA>
<PARA> To Bernie Marron at the Bentleigh Club, to the staff and members of organisations and companies that I have worked for over the past 20 years-and learned so much from, I would add-to the staff members at Broadbent stores, who have had a missing boss for some six years, I say, `You are very important to me'. That comment applies especially to those friends in the now abolished electorate of Streeton. To those friends I would also say, `You are the salt of the earth, and I appreciate everything that you have done for me'. </PARA>
<PARA> Lenny McGill said I was a punch-drunk boxer and that I never knew when to lie down. I admit that there have been times when I have felt a little sorry for myself. Obviously the honourable member for Banks felt the same way a few times. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1680 there was a gentlemen who had a little tougher time than I have had. His name was Roger Crab and he was in Cromwell's army for seven years. He had his skull cloven in battle and was then sentenced to death for indiscipline but survived to set up a business as a haberdasher or a draper, as I am. </PARA>
<PARA> One day he was seized by religious fervour; he gave away his shop and took up residence in a crude hut, where he lived the rest of his life on three farthings a week. His food consisted of bran, dock-leaves, mallows and grass. Several times he was cudgelled and put in the stocks. The wretched sackcloth frock was torn from his back and a merciless whip applied. He was imprisoned four times for being a wizard but died of old age in his hut on this day in 1680. There are those that have had a tough time before me!</PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to be here in this House. As yet, I have not moved into my new office. I owe a great debt to a former member of the House, Len Reid, who was the member for Holt. He has offered me the use of his converted garage as an office for the considerable period since the Federal election. I extend a special thanks to Len Reid. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Sunday morning after the election, I received a phone call from Mr Leo Ford, who proceeded to tell me that his record was intact and that he had never handed out how-to-vote cards for a losing candidate. I was pretty thrilled about that; I would rather he told me before the election. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, Mr Ford had handed out how-to-vote cards for the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and prior to that, Mr Barry Simon. Before that, Sir Phillip Lynch; before that, Sir Billy Snedden and back to 1938, one of our greatest statesmen, Sir Robert Menzies. So I am in pretty good company. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Leo Ford is a past mayor of the City of Oakleigh. He currently resides in the electorate of Corinella and, by coincidence, the current mayor of Oakleigh is Councillor Denise McGill, wife of my good friend, Lenny, whom I mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Corinella was a newly constituted electoral seat in Victoria at the last Federal election, there was an electoral seat of Corinella at Federation from 1900 to 1906, which was held by Sir James Whiteside McKay. He was a soldier, politician, lawyer, teacher and borough councillor. Jim McKay won his first seat in State parliament by just 10 votes. Then at Federation he won the seat of Corinella. The only parallel between Jim McKay and me is that he was a councillor, as was I. Indeed, I was Shire President of Pakenham and for six years and a councillor for that shire. I learned then the importance of local government, its closeness to the people and how important it is for this Parliament to face up to the needs and the problems that local government has today. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim McKay's story is remarkable. He was shot twice through the hat and once through the shirt on one day and he was not brought down until a bullet broke his leg-an injury that finally saw him relieved of his command and returned to Australia. Of course, there is much more about this man than I could possibly tell the House during the time that I have. </PARA>
<PARA> My reading of the biography of Jim McKay only enhanced my gratitude to our forefathers who shed their blood on behalf of their fellow Australians. I am of a generation where only a few have known the destruction of war and fewer have known the discipline of men like McKay. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir James McKay would be sad to see the world of today where in my State-Victoria-we have legal brothels. We have a growing drug problem. In fact the Westernport Drug and Alcohol Service tells me it has in my electorate what it calls a major needle exchange program. </PARA>
<PARA> Road trauma in Victoria is horrific. We have an inordinate number of single-parent families. Last year Australia had 43,000 divorces. I would remind the House of the resultant poverty of many of these children from broken homes. To our detriment, some are homeless and, worse than that, without hope. </PARA>
<PARA> My new electoral seat of Corinella encompasses broadly the area from rural Wonthaggi, Phillip Island to the industrial area of Dandenong-the original hub of commerce gateway for Gippsland. I will not be dissuaded by the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) in regard to the beauty or prominence of individual members' electorates because surely the boundaries of Corinella were made in heaven-from the rolling hills of Wonthaggi along the rugged shores of the Victorian coastline down to Phillip Island and the shores of Westernport Bay where I spent much of my boyhood; the rich, deep peat soils of the Kooweerup swamp-the place of my birth-then up into the magnificent urban surrounds of Cranbourne, Langwarrin, Keysborough and Hampton Park, where there is no room for an airport at this particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate has the Dandenong livestock market, General Motors-Holden's Ltd, Nissan, Toyota, Ford, Heinz, the International Harvester company, ACI, and Visy Board Pty Ltd. I could go on, but the real engine of Corinella still lies with the thousands of small businesses like my own and the farms that cover the electorate: family businesses, productive, efficient, stable; clothing manufacturers; furniture; steel fabrication; confectionery; horse training-and a bit of trading; and quarrying. We are the breadbasket of the Garden State. The area from Cranbourne to Kooweerup is a great production area. We export fresh and processed vegetables, organic asparagus, the best potatoes in Australia, the best milk from the Bass Valley, the best celery from the Schreurs farms. In fact the quality of the celery is so fresh that when snapped it can be heard in the eight Federal electorates that I border. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Flinders in his maiden speech spoke of the beauty of Phillip Island, its glorious beaches, penguins, mutton-birds and koalas-70 bus loads of tourists, local and international, descend daily on the island. The importance of tourism to my electorate, the electorate of Corinella, cannot be underestimated. The employment generated throughout the Bass Valley and in the shire of Phillip Island is crucial to our local economy. The devastation of the pilots strike and Victoria's being the first State on the east coast to have a bed tax are not grand preludes to the Australian Motor Cycle Grand Prix to be held at the picturesque Phillip Island circuit on Saturday. Australia will be the focus of world attention in Corinella as Wayne Gardner and Michael Doohan vie for the honour of winning and keeping that victory local. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking of a local victory, in the week before my maiden speech to this House, Phillip Island won the grand final in football. I congratulate that team and remind Pakenham footballers that they have a grand final to win next Saturday. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to the historical importance of the seat of Corinella and the original settlement: the first Government House, the first wheat crops, the first white man's structure in Victoria, the first military road in Victoria. The capital value of Victoria at this particular time, I dare say, is about the same as it was in the 1890s. The area from Phillip Island to Wonthaggi has major historical importance and significance to this nation. Wonthaggi has a proud history in coal production. Now a flourishing tourist industry in its State coal mine is a reminder of the great miners' union tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> My wife and I were pleased to celebrate on the weekend the re-enactment of the landing on Churchill Island of Lieutenant James Grant-a marvellous exercise. I would recommend a visit to Churchill Island to any honourable member; they can stop off at our many small businesses where they can spend their few dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Corinella are as diverse as its businesses, new Australians from our earliest migrant intakes. They have made an enormous contribution to the growth of industry. These people now own farms and businesses, successfully bringing the great attributes of their culture to ours. The immigrants of the seventies and eighties enrich again those people who came on sailing ships from the old country. The people of Corinella came from all over the world and many of them have been in Australia for more than my less than 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel privileged to represent in this House immigrants who still see Australia as a haven full of opportunity and promise, dedicated to their families' futures. Immigrants-many of whom I grew up with-now voice their concern about the balance in our current immigration policy and programs. I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to take the lead from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and go to the people of Australia and ask them what population mix they would prefer towards the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Westernport region that encompasses Corinella is a rich and diverse community, a microcosm of Australia. How is it that an area so rich can contain so many poor people, as a recent report by the Salvation Army showed? How is it that the richest nation in the southern hemisphere can contain as many people in difficulty as we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria is a financial wasteland. Traditionally it was the strongest industrial State in Australia with the least unemployment of any State. Victoria's strong position emanated from a firm foundation laid in the Bolte years, but it is now in desperate financial trouble and on economic indicators we are reportedly running second to New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Our State Government is asking our schools to borrow funds. Rather than accept their recurrent grants, they have offered to pay the interest on borrowings. Our small business is struggling, our plastic money debt is skyrocketing, with interest rates at 25 per cent. The State Government has knocked off the $100 per child education allowance and we are paying 2c on every litre of petrol to support the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society. Why is it that people do not understand that the first casualties of these incompetent governments are those most in need-those people who only want food, a roof, education for their children and grandchildren, and a job. It is sad to report that the big growth industry in my area is in opportunity shops.</PARA>
<PARA> The nation must take up the challenge to change our economy, for without reasonable economic growth and foreign debt reduction we will never afford, for instance, to tackle the major environmental problems we have in Australia. Commonsense and balance through leadership are at an all-time low in Australia. We were encouraged to get clever so we could have some social justice. It is not social justice when you cannot pay your rent; it is not social justice when you cannot meet your mortgage repayments; and it is not clever when a deliberate high interest rate policy affects your family budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Last year in Corinella we built 30 new homes a day, attacking all the problems of community service and infrastructure needs. Today the building industry is at a near standstill but State and Federal governments are asking us to build and house more than 60,000 people in the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of this House are household names; those in my electorate of Corinella have no greatness, but they are people who are popular in their homes. They are loved by the house cat, by the dog, by the neighbour's children and by their spouses. They are great people, even if they have never had their names in Who's Who. My electorate of Corinella has many such people.</PARA>
<PARA> Strong Opposition is good government. We have a first-class leader and an excellent team of which I am proud to be a member. I look forward to my initial term in parliament. </PARA>

We must always remember that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) had its origins in the bush as a result of the great shearers' strike-in rural Queensland, to be more precise, in my electorate of Kennedy at Barcaldine under a gum tree. As all honourable members on this side of the House are no doubt aware, that splendid gum became known as the tree of knowledge and a plaque beneath its trunk pays tribute to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The loyalty, courage and sacrifice in 1891 of the stalwart men and women of the west from whom, beneath this tree, emerged Australia's labour and political movement. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a proud moment for the people of Barcaldine, for the relatives of the strike leaders, for Pat Odgen of the Globe Hotel, when on 24 March-I guess I should say 25 or 26 March which was when people in Kennedy finally stopped voting-the tree of knowledge after 24 years was returned to its roots and came home to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> It was one of the proudest moments of my life when in early May this year, as the first Labor member for Kennedy for nearly a quarter of a century, I marched at the head of the Labour Day rally in Barcaldine. When I stood in front of the tree of knowledge I felt a profound sense of history; I could almost see the striking shearers and their supporters standing under the shade of the tree of knowledge arguing for a fair go for workers, calling for a decent wage and for some sort of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I will long remember that day in Barcaldine. It reaffirmed my commitment to the fundamental philosophy of the Australian Labor Party, the philosophy of social justice that aims to direct resources to those who need the most and to develop a fairer, more prosperous and more just society for every Australian. It was instilled in me at an early age by my parents. I thank them for that and I am pleased that they are both here with me today. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to my election I had a legal practice in Mount Isa and I was legal adviser to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service there. There are many individuals and groups in our society who, through no fault of their own, are disadvantaged. This is unfortunately the case for many Aboriginal and Islander people. The Aboriginal and Islander community still suffers from racial discrimination and from the imposition of a legal system that does not adequately reflect differing cultural values. This Government has gone a long way towards redeeming this situation and I am hopeful that the recently established Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission will be able to go even further towards meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also in Mount Isa that I met Tony McGrady. Tony was mayor and is now the State member for Mount Isa. It was the hard work of Tony and his wife Sandra, people such as Jim Brooks, Caroline Burke, Janet Enever, Roy Harris, Simon King, John Kirkpatrick, Chris Lewis, Anne MacKinnon, Bobby Moore, John White and all ALP branch members and long time supporters throughout Kennedy which made our historic victory last March possible. Finally, the support and encouragement of my wife, Petrina, was indispensable to me. I am thrilled that she is also here today and I know that her encouragement and, indeed, guidance will continue to be a great strength to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is ultimately because of the people of Kennedy that I am here today and I want to thank them for their support. It will not be an easy job to represent the interests of such a large and diverse electorate but I believe I have youth, energy and a real commitment on my side and I will certainly be doing my utmost. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the electorate of Kennedy is huge. It is a massive 772,000 square kilometres, which is almost 45 per cent of Queensland. Not only is it big in size; I believe it is the most diverse electorate in this country, with industries ranging from mining to sheep and cattle as well as sugar, tobacco, fishing and a wide variety of small crop farming on the Atherton tablelands. </PARA>
<PARA> So Kennedy is quite obviously a rural electorate. It is also traditionally a Labor electorate. Until the late Bob Katter senior won the seat for the National Party in 1966 Kennedy had had a Labor member for 61 of the 65 years since Federation. Kennedy has returned to the Australian Labor Party and it will move into the twenty-first century as an ALP seat. </PARA>
<PARA> All around Australia the Australian Labor Party has come back to its roots in the bush. This is especially so in Queensland where, of 24 Federal seats, 15 are held by the ALP, six by the Liberal Party and only three by the National Party. This is because this Government is prepared to listen to rural people and to provide the expert back-up necessary for our primary industries, whether this is in the form of rural adjustment schemes, research and development through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation or, indeed, marketing advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural Australians know that primary industries need an effective, coordinated and educated administration. John Kerin, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, is recognised by people of all political persuasions in the bush as the most outstanding primary industries Minister this country has ever had.</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government believes that it is essential that people in rural and remote areas have equal opportunity to gain access to government services and obtain their rightful entitlements. Consequently the Government has introduced the countrylink program, which provides an information service to help rural Australians find out about the range of Commonwealth government services available to them. Another initiative was the launch in July of this year of a pilot scheme called the Australian country information service, which is designed to bring information on a face to face basis to rural and remote communities. This scheme is being trialled in Longreach, Hughenden and Charters Towers in my electorate and is proving to be a great success. </PARA>
<PARA> The country task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was set up in 1986 to provide the means for the Government to meet the needs of rural people. I am pleased to be a member of that country task force, which visited Mount Isa and Ingham in July of this year and met with over 40 community and rural groups. The need to provide and to improve rural health services was one issue that arose as a prime concern in both Mount Isa and Ingham. The task force has reported to the Prime Minister, among other things, that there is a need for a rural health unit located outside Canberra. The task force recommended that as Mount Isa is currently the centre for the provision of medical services for almost half of Queensland it should be given serious consideration when selecting a site. The task force also reported to the Prime Minister that people in rural and remote areas require appropriate tax relief as an incentive to decentralise and to counter the high cost of living because of freight and other charges. I will continue to hammer this home to my colleagues in Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of Australia's key export earning industries are represented in my electorate. For example, it is impossible to ignore the contribution of the mining industry to Australia. My home town, Mount Isa, is built on top of the obvious wealth of Mount Isa Mines (MIM). The historic accord reached between this Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has created the industrial environment which has enabled companies like MIM to prosper. MIM earned almost $1.3 billion in export revenue for Australia in 1988-89 from sales of copper, silver, lead, zinc and coal. The company recently announced a record pre-tax profit last financial year of $451.6m. Of course, this would not have been possible without the dedication of the mine workers and the restraint exercised by all those within the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I represent the most diverse electorate in this country. It is impossible for me to know everything there is to know about the myriad of agricultural enterprises in Kennedy but I am listening to people and I am learning quickly. I have already met with representatives from the major farming groups in Kennedy and I am pleased to say that in all cases those meetings have been productive and informative. I have certainly learned a lot and some of my preconceptions about the farming sector have been shattered. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers are generally perceived to be a conservative lot, dogmatically sticking to the tried and true, steadfastly resisting change and spouting age-old political rhetoric. Yet in my albeit brief period in office I have found that it is an unusual farmer today who is not familiar with the computer application most relevant to his or her industry or the latest information on world commodity markets. Farmers are risk takers. They have to be with so many variables involved in the success or failure of farming ventures. Risk takers are not by nature conservative. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there are some sectors of the farming industry that are steadfastly resisting change. If we are going to become more sustainably productive and improve our marketing skills faster than our competitors then change must occur-change not only in farming practices but, just as importantly, in attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Climatic extremes are the norm in my electorate. For example, in April this year places like Alpha, Blackall and Jericho were devastated by record floods. Richmond, some 600 kilometres away to the north, was recovering from a record period of low rainfall. The attitude of both the farming sector and the Government has been to treat such extremes as national disasters. This attitude, however, does not encourage effective farm management or responsible land care. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a change in attitude toward climatic extremes is something that the recently released report of the national drought policy review task force addressed. The task force concluded that to achieve more sustainable agricultural production systems both industry and government must accept that there is no such thing as a normal or average season. The task force argued that farmers must manage for climate variables just as they do for income variables and economic pressures. This is not a one-way track. Under the scheme proposed by the task force the Commonwealth will still be involved in alleviating hardship suffered by primary producers and those in rural industries on an individual needs basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, Government policies, as the task force suggests, must recognise the risks in any agricultural enterprise and provide appropriate encouragement to producers to manage for climatic and economic risks as part of their ongoing business activities. I am pleased to say that this is already happening. Following proposals put forward by the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, this Government, in cooperation with the States, has introduced a land care program. The recent Budget announced expanded tax concessions available for land care activities aimed at reducing land degradation. Thousands of hectares of north-west Queensland are used for grazing cattle. I am pleased to say that graziers are finally turning their attention to sustainable land care and risk management practices. Land degradation is undoubtedly one of the most important environmental issues of this decade. Unless sensible conservation practices are introduced now, we risk destroying the productivity of the region altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the report of the national drought policy review task force as I believe that the management systems discussed in the report will set the agenda for agriculture in the 1990s. Extremes of drought and flood are the norm in western and northern Queensland and, indeed, throughout most of Australia. It seems to me that rainfall variability must be taken into account as a commercial risk by all farming enterprises. That includes farmers in my electorate on the tablelands producing peanuts, tobacco, rare fruits, potatoes and rice. It also includes canegrowers in my electorate around Tully and Ingham who are looking at increased returns next financial year, and a large number of woolgrowers in Kennedy. The wool industry is resilient and it is important to all Australians, especially the people of Kennedy, that it prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that the wool industry is appropriately organised to take on the challenge of the 1990s the Government has commissioned a review of the industry. The Wool Review Committee will be reporting to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in July 1991. I am encouraging all woolgrowers in my electorate to make submissions to the Committee to ensure that they are involved in the process that will shape the future of the industry in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as mining and agriculture, tourism is a growing industry in my electorate. Kennedy offers the Australian or international traveller a sample of all the best Australia has to offer, from the fair dinkum outback experience on cattle stations to whitewater rafting through World Heritage listed rainforest. The Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach is attracting some 800 visitors a day during the peak season. We hope to have the workers heritage centre at Barcaldine completed in time for the ALP's centenary celebrations next year, and the Blackall wool scour restoration project received a one-off grant in this year's Budget that will ensure that it will be another great attraction for north-west Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> In Kennedy the tourist can experience the natural environment undamaged by excessive development. The area with the most obvious potential for this sort of eco-tourism is the wet tropics area. Once the wet tropics management authority gets off the ground I hope to see walking tracks through the rainforest so that the Australian people who own the World Heritage listed area can get in there and see it for themselves but in a controlled way that will not damage the environment. An ideal way to achieve this is to have local Aboriginal people involved in the planning and development of suitable walking tracks. The World Heritage listing in the wet tropics area is testament to the fact that Australians and people everywhere are beginning to realise that if we do not act to save our forests now it is our children and their children who will suffer for generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of children, I congratulate this Government on its efforts in relation to child-care. When the Government came to office in 1983 there were only 46,000 subsidised child-care places throughout Australia. Under this Government there will be an estimated quarter of a million subsidised places by 1995. However, I do find it surprising that of the hundreds of thousands of child-care centres that now exist there is not one here in this building. When Parliament is sitting there are up to 3,000 people working in the confines of the building, many of whom are from working families, who require child-care facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude my first speech in this House, with the Party's special conference coming up in two weeks time I want to take advantage of the opportunity to say a few words about resistance to change, about the philosophy of social justice and about priorities within the Party. When Charles McDonald, the first ever member for the seat of Kennedy and a member of the ALP, addressed this Parliament for the first time in June 1901 he damned the inhumanity of the enforced migration of Kanaka labourers to the Queensland cane fields. Mr McDonald was also very concerned about the threat that the slave trade posed to the employment of white labour and in this way his speech reflected the early racism of the Australian political parties. The worker that McDonald's Labor Party represented was understood to be white, Anglo-Saxon and male. </PARA>
<PARA> This view effectively became part of the Labor Party platform when in 1905 the second ever meeting of the Party's Federal Conference passed a two-part objective. Part A called for the cultivation of an Australian sentiment based on the maintenance of racial purity and the development in Australia of an enlightened and self-reliant community. Such was the origin of the now infamous White Australia policy that remained in the ALP party platform until 1961. This policy reflected the aspirations and ideological goals of the early members of the ALP. It reflected the political climate of the day. How times have changed! The ALP now embraces multiculturalism, aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination, specifically adopts a non-discriminatory immigration policy and provides for the recognition of the prior ownership of Australian land by Aboriginal and Islander people. Current ALP objectives concerning issues of race and culture and the attitudes of Australian society generally have come a long way from the racist, ethnocentric view of the world reflected in part A of the Party's 1905 objective. We are a far more cosmopolitan and informed society now and I believe that the ALP has been fundamental in bringing about a more enlightened society. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that there is a lot more we have to do. In my electorate, two communities have suffered incredibly as a result of 32 years of National Party rule in Queensland. Doomadgee and Mornington Island, both communities of 1,200 people, do not have regular or sustainable water supplies. The water that is available is of poor quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The national inquiry into homeless youth conducted by the Federal Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, identified Mount Isa as an area with a chronic rate of homelessness among Aboriginal youth. This was no surprise to me in view of my previous experience. There is a screaming need for reforms in the juvenile justice area. As a result of the Burdekin report funding to relevant welfare groups has increased but there must be a continuing commitment by Federal and State governments to implementing the major recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that part B of the Party's 1905 objective called for the collective ownership of monopolies. This policy also reflected the aspirations and ideological goals of early members of the ALP. As well, it reflected the political climate of the day. This policy has also changed over the last 80 years. I do not want to delve too deeply into the policy debate within the ALP as it will be up to the elected delegates to anguish over those issues later this month, but I do want to make the obvious point that what has enabled the ALP to bring about a fairer and more enlightened society is its ability to grow and change with the times. I believe that it has been the role of the branches in making policy that has kept the Party alive and growing and at the vanguard of social change in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The world economy has changed radically this century. The political climate in Australia and in the world is changing. I believe that party platform has not been and should not be dogmatically retained simply on the basis that it is party platform. We are a far more enlightened society than we were in 1905. I believe that what should be considered sacrosanct by all members of the ALP is the philosophy of social justice that aims to direct resources towards those who need them most and the role of branches in forming policies to achieve that end. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I want to say that I intend to be around this House for a long time. The National Party has lost all credibility in the bush. We could say it has had a credibility bypass. The tree of knowledge has come home to its roots and those roots are digging deeper every day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) raised, as a matter of privilege, two articles concerning the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. The honourable member said that it was clear that both articles revealed either that the authors had seen confidential draft reports of the Committee or that they had been informed of the private deliberations of the Committee. The honourable member for Calwell quoted House of Representatives Practice on a prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of committee proceedings and draft reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are certainly a number of precedents for such disclosure being pursued as matters of contempt, although no such question has been determined by the House of Representatives since the enactment of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. Nevertheless, on the precedents available to me, I have concluded that a prima facie case has been made out such as would justify me in according precedence to a motion on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Before we proceed to that stage, however, I should point out that since 1985-86 the British House of Commons has followed a specially developed procedure in these matters. If disclosure of the proceedings of or draft reports of a committee is made, the committee concerned seeks to discover the source of the leak and to assess whether it constitutes or is likely to constitute a substantial interference with its work, with the select committee system, or with the functions of the House. If the committee considers that there has been or is likely to be such interference, the committee reports to the House accordingly, and a report of this character stands automatically referred to the Committee of Privileges.</PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives has adopted no such procedure and technically the House of Commons practice no longer has standing here. Nevertheless, members may feel that this might be a proposition that we could consider and that the Commons procedure has much to commend itself in cases such as this.</PARA>
<PARA> My basic conclusion is still that a prima facie case has been made out and I am prepared to give priority to a motion. I would suggest, however, that it might suit the convenience of the House if, rather than having a motion of referral moved at this stage, the matter is given some further consideration by the Joint Standing Committee along the lines now followed in the House of Commons. There is no need for anyone to make any comment if we believe that this might be the direction we should follow.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, there is much discussion at present about the parlous state of Australia's manufacturing industry-its failure to adopt an exporting ethos and the merits of the sort of policy environment advocated by the Garnaut report, the Australian Manufacturing Council and many others. The very existence of such a large and diverse body of opinion on the policy framework needed for industry is in itself testimony to the misgivings that exist about the Government's present policy approach. Those misgivings are no more apparent than in the recent Budget appropriations for the manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just to remind the House, the Budget provides for direct Government financial assistance to manufacturing industry in 1990-91 of $376.2m. On the face of it that sounds pretty impressive, but when put against the manufacturing industry's estimated annual turnover of $150 billion and fixed capital expenditure of $4.5 billion, it of course loses much of its significance. It loses even more if we take that a step further and look at its directional effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Of that total amount of $376m, some $91m is directed to the photographic film, textile, clothing and footwear industries, all sectors where the assistance is motivated largely by political rather than by economic considerations. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A further $80m is being directed to the shipbuilding, machinery, engineering and automotive industries where fundamental reform, rather than a few million dollars of assistance, is essential to restructure them into internationally competitive enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I make for the information of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who interjected, is simply that at best some 50 per cent or a mere $180m of Government assistance is being directed towards industries, companies or projects where there may be some scope for the sort of growth and development that could eventually create viable and competitive export oriented enterprises. To date-and I emphasise this point-not one such industry has been created. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look briefly at some of the assisted sectors. Between 1984 and 1989 the Government gave special assistance to the Australian steel industry. From previous Budget Papers, I estimate that total assistance to that industry over those years was of the order of $150m. I will discuss that a little bit later, but it will be my conclusion that the $150m of assistance and the five-year industry plan have failed to create a viable Australian steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The automotive industry has had about 20 years of government plans and associated financial assistance, but over recent weeks its spokesmen have claimed that it cannot survive without ongoing assistance of about $1.6 billion a year-that is the Ford proposal-or long term concessional loans-the Toyota proposal-or protection to offset Australia's economic shortcomings-the GMH proposal. After 20 years of protective industry plans, is this Government going to fall for more of the same arguments as the solution to the restructuring needs of this industry?</PARA>
<PARA> I address myself particularly to the Minister's interjection. Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd last year claimed that it was in such desperate straits that it successfully convinced the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-the fact that the business happened to be in the Prime Minister's electorate surely did not have any influence on the decision at all-to give the company $36m. This was, we were told, to prevent it closing its Melbourne plant and to assist it with export promotion in the Asian region. Last month it was observed that Kodak's parent company in the United States reported a second quarter profit of $492m. That $492m was a quarter-year profit. What conclusion could anybody draw about the credibility of Kodak Australia's claim for assistance and the Hawke Government's response?</PARA>
<PARA> Another industry area receiving substantial bounty assistance is the Australian computer industry. The critics of this scheme appear greatly to outnumber its supporters. My own reading of the industry situation suggests that despite the bounty scheme-or indeed because of it-significant areas of that industry are in decline, robot manufacturing being perhaps the best example. </PARA>
<PARA> I could give further examples, and they add up to clear evidence of unsuccessful special sector policies. That failure has its origins in the Australian Labor Party's 1982 election manifesto. Its manufacturing industry policy noted that:</PARA>
<PARA>Industrial renewal will require Government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA>It set, as its objectives, to-and I quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a general statement of intention, there can be no denying the fact, even by the Minister, that the Government's manufacturing industries policy has not met its objectives. We have not seen, and thankfully so, the promised levels of government intervention. A strong and integrated manufacturing industry has certainly not been created, and the Hawke Government's failure to develop an export-oriented industry, whether to the Pacific region or beyond, is one of the principal explanations for this country's present current account difficulties, rampant foreign debt and vulnerability to future economic downturns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the information of the Minister, this failure is confirmed by an impeccable source, no less than the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, who is the Minister responsible for manufacturing industry policies. On 10 July 1989 Senator Button publicly admitted that after six years in the job, he had got the Government's industry policies wrong and that he did not know where to go. This is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce speaking. This remarkable admission was refreshing for its honesty but very disturbing in its implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Government's policy has been wrong is serious enough in itself, but more disturbing is the fact that it took the Minister six years to come to an understanding of his failure. The tragedy for Australia is that for most of those years, the Minister and the Hawke Government sat idly by, apparently ignoring the mounting evidence that their industry policies were not achieving their objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why the Minister allowed this to happen is almost certainly explained by his admission that he does not know where to go. I believe him because despite his confession, no new policy direction has been forthcoming. In fact, we have had to wait six months for even a glimmer of hope. </PARA>
<PARA> In February this year, the Australian Financial Review reported that the Hawke Government was developing a fourth term industry policy agenda. But it was only a glimmer and now, in September 1990, we still wait with bated breath. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I turn to a more detailed consideration of the nature of and the reasons for the Government's failed special sector industry policies. A very good case study is offered by the steel industry, which receives special assistance from the Government, and does so, presumably, because it met the 1983 policy criteria of being a large employer of labour with special regional significance. </PARA>
<PARA> The steel industry plan was announced on 11 August 1983 and operated from 1= January 1984 until 31 December 1988. Its history and progress is well documented in annual and special reports of the Steel Industry Authority. In the early 1980s, the world's steel industry was in recession and was characterised by excess capacity, high protection, substantial government assistance for exports and highly competitive production from newly developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Australian industry, demand for raw steel fell from a peak of 7 million tonnes in 1980-81 to about 4.6 million tonnes in 1982-83. The share obtained by Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) of that declining local demand was also in decline. In other words, imports were increasing. As well, exports of raw steel had been in steady decline since 1976-77. </PARA>
<PARA> A BHP submission to an Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) inquiry in December 1982 sought government assistance for a 10-year period. In return for an investment plan totalling $2.8 billion over 10 years to construct new steel making facilities, BHP sought as a minimum a guaranteed 85 per cent of the domestic market and full and immediate tax deductibility for all capital expenditure. In presenting this case, BHP said that the protection and assistance requirements were the minimum necessary to allow the company to survive. As well, it was subsequently reported to the Steel Industry Authority that at the time of the IAC inquiry, BHP had threatened that without that minimum protection and assistance, it would close its Newcastle and Whyalla plants and even consider a complete withdrawal from the domestic steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government responded in August 1983 with a five-year steel industry plan. Its principal objectives were to establish a viable and internationally competitive steel industry in Australia, to provide competitively priced steel to domestic users, and to provide job security for the industry's employees. We have to ask, of course, whether these objectives were achieved. Let us have a look at them. </PARA>
<PARA> Labour productivity at BHP steel plants was at an unacceptably low figure in 1983 of 191 tonnes per employee per annum, a figure which compared badly with about double that in Canada and even higher figures in modern Japanese, British and American plants. BHP initially sought to achieve a labour productivity level of 250 tonnes per employee per annum. This was achieved during 1984 and the target was increased to 350 tonnes per employee per annum by December 1988. In fact, the highest average level of productivity which I have been able to establish over the life of the plan was 294 tonnes per employee per annum at December 1985, with the highest specific level achieved being 322 tonnes per employee per annum at the Newcastle plant. At that time, for the sake of comparison, the Kimitsu plant in Japan was achieving 374 tonnes per employee per annum; Bethlehem Steel in the United States of America was achieving 388 tonnes per employee per annum, and British Steel's Port Talbot plant achieved 389 tonnes per employee per annum. To put it plainly, the best that the steel industry plan could achieve was productivity of about 80 per cent of that in comparable overseas plants. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982 BHP formally submitted to the IAC that the survival and development of the industry would require a $2.8 billion investment outlay over 10 years. Yet one year later under the steel industry plan, BHP was able to commit itself to a capital program of only $800m over the first four years of the plan. It did exceed that target, but as the Bureau of Industry Economics has reported in a submission to the Steel Industry Authority, it is estimated that BHP already had plans in 1982, under its $2.8 billion proposal, to expend $712m on capital over the period 1983-87. </PARA>
<PARA> Given BHP's known capital stock situation in 1983, $400m per annum was needed merely for replacement purposes.  In its submission, the Bureau of Industry Economics stated:</PARA>
<PARA>BHP's . . . total investment over the period of steel plan . . . may have been barely sufficient to recover the real replacement cost of the economic decay of existing capital assets. </PARA>
<PARA>The Steel Industry Authority report for the year to June 1988 makes two particularly telling observations. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Investment by BHP in steel production during the 1970s was allowed to fall behind that which was necessary to keep pace with international trends in steel making technology and its Steel Division was, therefore, ill-equipped to deal with the recession in steel in the early 1980s and with the increased competitive pressure from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It is unclear to what extent the plant itself was responsible for this level of investment. </PARA>
<PARA>BHP's 1988-89 annual report shows a $664m capital expenditure during that year and a commitment to a further $1.1 billion future outlay. Given the assessment of the Steel Industry Authority in 1983 that BHP needed a $400m outlay per annum just to maintain the existing capital stock, I believe that an indexing of that figure would suggest that BHP's 1988-89 outlay provides for negligible real growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The attainment of a harmonious and constructive industrial relations climate was critical to the success of the steel industry plan and to the future viability of an Australian steel industry. This is something, of course, that the Government always prides itself on, particularly the Minister. Under the plan, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and BHP committed themselves to an agreed disputes settlement procedure. The man hours lost in the industry due to industrial disputation over the life of the plan speak for themselves. In 1981, 845,000 man hours were lost and in 1982, 550,000 man hours were lost. The figure fell to about 100,000 in 1984 and 1985. Then, the figure starts to increase again, with 233,000 man hours lost in 1986 and 376,000 man hours lost in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The Steel Industry Authority stated in a subsequent annual report that the dispute settlement procedures failed and that `clearly, poor industrial relations, particularly at Port Kembla, are inimical to the future growth and viability of Australia's basic steel industry'. Why then did the industrial relations commitment fail, particularly as it was so strongly supported by the Government? We turn again to the Steel Industry Authority. The Authority tells us that there was `a lack of union support to commitments'; that `no serious attempt appears to have been made by the ACTU to either explain to members the commitments made on their behalf'-that would be pretty right-`or to ensure that the commitments were honoured'-that would be even more right; and that `despite repeated invitations, Mr Kelty did not personally attend any of the Authority's meetings with BHP and the unions to discuss industrial relations issues'. Here was an unelected member of Cabinet not even turning up, not even going along to talk on these things. </PARA>
<PARA> Attention to improved quality was another cornerstone of the steel industry plans, both in terms of the product itself and the servicing of customer requirements. It had been expected that the steel industry plan would bring about a considerable improvement in this service. However, the Authority's report for 1987-88 stated that it found continuing evidence of a high level of dissatisfaction. The Steel Industry Authority cited considerable evidence of BHP's unreliability and attitudes causing either interference with or cancellation of export sales. </PARA>
<PARA> BHP would undoubtedly defend itself by, amongst other things, pointing to its recent export performance, including its Price Waterhouse Business Award as an export achiever. It is true that exports of iron and steel products were $710m in 1989-90, an increase of 42 per cent over 1988-89 exports of $498m. However, the 1988-89 figure was not only the lowest level of exports over the past five years, but exports have shown no real growth trend over at least the past 10 years. The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the 1990 export achievements simply reflect a reaction to surplus production being available from lowered domestic demand. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some substance to that claim, I notice that a recent media article cites BHP Steel's chief executive, John Prescott, as admitting that the recent export sales would seriously hit profits. Such a remark must imply that prices of overseas sales are less than those of domestic sales, with the ominous word `seriously' suggesting that those price reductions were probably very substantial. This is not indicative of a product which is competitive in overseas markets at viable prices. That viability is further questioned by Australia's imports of competitive iron and steel products. Since 1985, the value of those imports has almost doubled, and I make the observation that in 1983, when the steel industry plan began, we imported $115 worth of iron and steel products for every $100 worth of exports. In 1990 we are importing almost $150 worth of those products for every $100 worth exported. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in response to the difficulties of the 1980s, most steel companies around the world embarked on major restructuring programs to develop and install technologically improved facilities and processes. The major innovations have been improved blast furnace operations, continuous casting, improved rolling operations, and computerisation of production processes. BHP has been slow to adopt these new technologies, and all of the evidence at my disposal suggests that the Government steel industry plan, the industry itself and its work force failed to identify and achieve the real targets necessary to make BHP a viable operation by international standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Without a major change in government, management and trade union attitudes, it seems to me that the industry's viability is so fragile that its long term future in the face of anticipated technological change must be seriously in doubt. Today, some 14 months after the Minister's admission of failure, we are still waiting for the Hawke Government to bring in policies which will encourage the attitudinal changes in management and the trade unions that are so essential if Australia is ever to establish itself as a manufacturing nation of international standing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Before I call the honourable member for Reid, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Reid)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.25)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is great pride in representing Reid, with its historic Labor traditions. I refer to its rank and file and to the contribution of my predecessors. Amongst the latter was Percy Coleman, who played an heroic role as President of the Federal Labor Party against the Lang forces. Defeated in 1931, his early death was accelerated by the intense conflict between Labor factions, centred on Reid. Local newspapers cited particular bitterness and demanding schedules of public and Party meetings. He displayed a visionary interest in world affairs. His activities spanned the International Labour Organisation, the League of Nations and the Mandates Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lang himself represented Reid. I will not dwell on a career that involved extensive progressive social legislation and an unfortunate predilection for heavy handed undemocratic procedures. His early delineation of America's growing economic and military power spelled an astute appraisal not understood by his contemporaries. </PARA>
<PARA> My predecessor, Tom Uren, who held the seat for 31 years, served as a Cabinet Minister and as Deputy Leader. He was central to the campaign to reverse Australia's subservient involvement in Vietnam. His analysis of the needs of sprawling suburban areas in the urban affairs and housing and local government portfolios merits continued consideration. The Auburn Japanese Gardens, Merrylands Central Gardens and Lake Gilawarna stand as testimony to his emphasis on community open space. His maiden speech covered matters on the current agenda: an airline sale, the Constitution as a barrier to social change, concentration of media control, New Guinea's future and industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, more important than the members of parliament, Reid involves an active Party membership, often at variance with mainstream Party thinking. My persistent connections with them ensure a continued realisation of local aspirations. Our organisation reflects more than an activist circle. The relative size of our local Party means strong roots in varied ethnic groups and different geographic centres. I will not repeat the thanks I conveyed on election night. Suffice it to say that one of my enduring objections in Australian Labor Party (ALP) internal affairs is the belief in inherited power for individual union officials per se. They should earn such power from personal activity outside of work hours. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, Reid has had people who fulfilled that role, including two senior officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-my brother Martin and Dick Scott of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union (AMWU)- Peter Connolly, Assistant Secretary of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association, and Australian Workers Union organiser Tom Blacker, who know that the ALP requires branch secretaries and presidents as well as people rolling up to conferences and raising their hands in delegations. Outside the local Party, I particularly thank Frank Belan and the National Union of Workers for providing a campaign office when I resigned from the State seat. </PARA>
<PARA> No genuine representative can really indulge in a fetish with parochial needs. Nevertheless, aspects of my electorate are crucial to my appraisal of issues. I cite some. According to the 1986 census, Reid is in the top third of seats with incomes under $12,000. It had only 16.5 per cent of people in managerial occupational categories 1 to 3. The Australian rate is about 30 per cent. It had high unemployment and a quarter of the work force in manufacturing industry, given a national figure of 15.1 per cent. It was in the bottom 20 electorates for work force participation rates. Reid was concurrently very high for wage and salary earners and low for self-employeds and employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Of Australia's 148 seats, Reid made the first 20 for persons born overseas and residents of less than five years. It had nine times the national average of Muslims and one-third more Catholics, mainly due to the Maronite presence. It was in the first 10 seats for South East Asian migrants. Of overseas born residents, Lebanese and Turks were nine times more prevalent, Poles and Russians twice as prevalent and Vietnamese four times as prevalent as the national average. There were fewer home owners and purchasers and more tenants. Given local public transport, the proportion with two vehicles-29 per cent-was amongst the lowest in Australia. For over-50-year-olds, the figure for Australia was 24.4 per cent, for Reid 28.6 per cent. Reid was rated ninetieth in median age by youth. It was in the top 25 seats for residents with no qualifications, most of its fellow travellers being rural electorates.</PARA>
<PARA> Recent years have witnessed a surge of rhetoric conjuring up a supposed contradiction between the rights of organised labour and individual freedom. The last session of this very Parliament witnessed many appeals, with numerous references to a supposed liberation that was to occur through increased fines on unions, decreased health and safety rights and specious voluntary agreements. Appeals have centred on the futility of unions to represent individual needs in an era of decentralised workplaces and a diminishing traditional employment sector. Legislation originally resisted by these new found champions on anti-discrimination, freedom of information and safety rules now supposedly suffices to protect the individual in all workplace disputes. They claim union help is superfluous. In fact these apologists are attempting to legitimise the naked power and authority of management. </PARA>
<PARA> The moves have come after unprecedented industrial harmony, as a quiescent work force has been persuaded to effect a significant reduction in labour's slice of domestic product and erosion of living standards. These prophets seek a combination of results to totally dissociate wage movement from price rises, further reduce unit labour costs without commensurate social wage gains, and differentiate wages across Australia's industries and between related enterprises. Despite the facade of voluntarism, there would be repressive measures to stymie any flow-ons from new agreements. Superannuation, a long overdue national agenda, would have no new improvements through arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting superannuation gains made through the accord. The number of employees covered by a scheme has risen from 41.5 per cent in 1986-87 to 54.6 per cent in 1988-89. However, it is of concern that only 75 per cent of those with an entitlement were actually covered. Still, in the private sector only 41 per cent of workers have coverage-admittedly, a rise from 34 per cent the previous year. Superannuation would be left to the discredited theories of managerial largesse, so piteously pilloried in the recent grabs by Shell, Westpac and others, to exploit unexpected excesses in superannuation funds. As Barry Dunstan stated in the Australian Financial Review of 7 July, of Shell's attempt to switch $1 billion in assets from its funds:</PARA>
<PARA>The 1990s may prove a period of less buoyant investment returns, which mean it is not a good time for employees to move from a defined benefit to an accumulation scheme because . . . the employees bear the investment risk. </PARA>
<PARA>This recent example of an employer on my electorate's doorstep graphically shows the realism of industrial relations rather than the pastoral landscapes portrayed by new right ideologies. </PARA>
<PARA> The same paper on 29 August reported another aspect of this bright future. In response to valid ACTU concerns of inconsistency in Industrial Relations Commission decisions and a campaign to accomplish the accord mark VI, employers met at the Confederation of Australian Industry and proposed to penalise the less militant unions that had not accomplished their claims. This was the big stick. One questions how reasonable employer responses would be in the absence of strong national industry unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's centralised wage system, despite the limitation of the country's Constitution, has meant that firms competing in similar industries are not severely undermined by less scrupulous employers. It has meant that the peculiarities of State labour markets are not dominant in destroying local wages and conditions. It has ensured that, despite frequent government intervention, there has been some connection between the price movements that workers have suffered and their wage packets. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent revelations of Queensland's voluntary agreements could be compared to people rummaging through the dustbin and files of East Germany's Stasi Secret Police to get the facts. They demonstrate why the Greiner Government tried to make it virtually a capital offence to reveal details of its much vaunted voluntary agreements. They are simply a recipe to smash conditions and rights-freedom to be exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one can seriously believe that understaffed, underfinanced workshop based unions have a serious negotiating parity with employers. The areas of intense labour shortage where that would be viable are extremely limited. The New South Wales Government's recent suggestions typify the suppression heralded by the supposed thrust for freedom. They are the model for Federal conservatives. The 25= May elopement of the Greiner Government with the Gallagher Builders Labourers Federation exposed the humbug of their facade of individual freedom, anti-corruption and respect for legalities. The recent legislative effort was a naked attempt to cast aside any vestiges of protection for the unorganised, the less skilled and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the suggested gains that New South Wales workers will experience are the abolition of the annual leave loading, the end of many penalty rates, localised site agreements with conditions below established awards and immediate stand-downs without the current need to establish that labour cannot be productively utilised. Attacks on work site safety rights follow fast on WorkSafe Australia statistics of 200 building workers' deaths between 1982 and 1989. Certainly there are tears and laments by conservative politicians after the more traumatic, newsworthy catastrophes. However, the assault on the building industry's safety precautions in the name of productivity is the reality. It starkly contrasts with Federal Labor's recent safety induction scheme, workers' manual and kit trainers' guide and dispute settling procedure. That the conservatives were going through the motions with the Niland inquiry is shown by the swift abandonment to the dustbin of this limited area for industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> As detailed earlier, the Hawke Labor Government's period of office has been accompanied by a decline in real earnings, as typified by the Treasury Roundup of Economic Statistics showing that the non-farm wage share has fallen from 64.9 per cent of production to 57.6 per cent since 1983. Even from the period 1985-86, the profit share has grown from 14.8 per cent to over 17 per cent. Certainly, this is related to the vulnerability of the union movement, economic recession and government imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it has also spelt out the crucial role of the accord and the recognition by the ACTU of national needs. Certainly, there have been gains such as the Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act, industrial relations reforms, social wage improvements, wider application of superannuation and Government initiatives towards amalgamations. The latter is a desired move of much of industry, albeit by different approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the principal impetus was the recognition of Australia's dire trade balance and the continued decline of value added goods within our exports. The most recent figures indicating the patchy gains in this sector, despite promised investment with augmented profits, must place continued union compliance under great strain. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asked to make the attack on foreign debt and servicing a priority justifying national sacrifice. For how long will the public be prepared to do so when four major corporations' contribution to net foreign debt totals $15 billion? Can members of the public respect the illogicality of moves to privatise Telecom Australia, thus endangering native equipment manufacture in the crucial communications and informations sector where $4 billion of our trade deficit lies and is certain to grow even without this counterproductive measure?</PARA>
<PARA> This year has witnessed some positive trends in the trade picture. A March quarter rise in manufactured imports followed an underlying trend of slower import growth and parallels and a 11.5 per cent increase in manufactured exports above the previous year's level. The manufacturing investment has been on a more diverse front than earlier surges. For the June quarter, seasonally adjusted import values fell by 11 per cent, and there were signs of improvement in non-metal manufactured goods. July witnessed a tenth growth in imports, and some commentators feared that this might be more relevant than previous trends because of an underlying reduction in raw materials at hand. Additionally, fears have been expressed that the direction has not been towards new capacity for exports and countering imports but to replace and update plant in existing patterns. Unfortunately, much of it has centred on the financial services sector, instanced in tourism and not internationally traded. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it has to be asked whether the impact of higher interest rates is undermining the supposed gains of the diversion from wages to profits. How long can the union movement hold the line? While it does, a recent copy of Australian Society reports work on the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1986 income distributor survey by Andrew Dilnot. It detailed an estimate of 19.7 per cent of wealth in the hands of the richest one per cent and 55.2 per cent possessed by the wealthiest tenth of the population. The bottom half hold less than 2 per cent. In that article, Andrew Dilnot also covers the regressive nature of the taxation of savings and notes the amount of progressivity required of other parts of the tax system to counter it. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, expectations by the union movement regarding a cooperative restructuring of the industrial base, real industrial democracy, retraining, an investment fund to set redirection, et cetera, have not been realised. I cite Vic Taylor in the Journal of Australian Political Economy, April 1990, at page 44, when he noted that, instead, we have the push for `enterprism which pays no attention to strategic level institutions' and would seek `to put in place communications programs and personnel measures designed to enhance micro-corporatist tendencies and to mould enterprise union organisation into user-friendly entities'. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these questions, the accord represents a preferable course to a regime of market forces dominance, wage break-outs, inflation, unemployment and wage freezes. This has been the sad history of conservative industrial relations. The accord signals an attempt to garner diverse forces for the national interest. It contains national wage outcomes in expectation of gains in social wage, trade relations, career paths and investment policy. It represents an overdue initiative to balance economic imperatives with equity. The alternative is uncharted and advocated by people who, today, simultaneously rush to join the Norm Gallagher rehabilitation club. Apparently, his stance of violence and intimidation is to be condoned as long as it serves corporate imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In a free society, industrial relations must entail a degree of compromise. Without the suppression of liberties implicit in the Howard-Hewson industrial relations agenda, neither side can expect overwhelming superiority. It is, therefore, interesting to note the survey in the Confederation of Australian Industry publication the Employer for July 1990. We all know that employers and unions have wish lists. Both forces have their realists, and I dare say that they would be fairly prevalent in the surveyed group. It is reassuring for our system that 70 per cent of those who thought that broad banding would aid productivity thought change was achievable by late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, on a more partisan subject, such as treating weekends as ordinary hours, only 21.6 per cent of the 45.8 per cent who felt it necessary were as confident. However, any person who does not believe that El Salvador-Guatemala style industrial relations is the best road would be fairly comfortable with figures of 56.4 per cent for adherence to awards, 42.5 per cent for sick leave, 55.8 per cent for new training and 73.8 per cent for multi-skilling. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there are limited absolutes and all economies suffer international realities, an article in the European Industrial Relations Review of February 1990 indicated a more pronounced development of an accord process. It detailed Sweden's efforts and, admittedly, some of the worrying down side, including a trend to overseas subsidiary diversion of research, the dilution of the solidarity wage policy by profit sharing and employee loans and emphasis on overseas investment. Nevertheless, Sweden's policy has resulted in a low 1.3 per cent unemployment rate, which is a seventh of the unemployment rate of France and a quarter of West Germany. Its wages policy has answered inflation with an equity of wages across industry, forcing unprofitable enterprises to cease. </PARA>
<PARA> Sweden's 1988 labour market programs, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, meant a level of expenditure trailing only Spain and France in active endeavours, that is, employment services, training, youth measures and employment subsidies. In contrast, this leads to a situation where, with the low unemployment figures, its income maintenance efforts are the nadir of relative labour market efforts. Relocation assistance for industrially moribund areas has been stressed. Equally, the government business partnership has ensured that prosperous firms direct some employment to deprived areas, and there has been State intervention to enhance socially desirable but financially plagued operators. A series of reports from external credible sources has detailed a combination of very minimal unemployment, constricted inflation and a consolidated national budget. It has been accompanied by a singularly successful placement policy for trainees. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge for Australia is to overcome the constraints of traditional thought of a limited role for government in planning and industrial policy. Unfortunately, recent decisions stressing self-regulation in major resource projects, rather than active government monitoring of local content, appear to be a recipe for minimal gains. A shift of profits has been no guarantee of an expanding export sector. The Government must harness government enterprises to provide management skills, a history of achievement on complex projects and pools of expertise to ensure a reasonable native component in measures to really do something about the value added sector. I am proud that the Budget's industrial relations component has greater funding for the workplace reform program, encouragement of amalgamations, a further encouragement of the integration of our State and Federal systems and work on equal pay and award adherence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken earlier of the pressures on the accord and concerns about its future. On other fronts the last election spelled a recognition of Labor accomplishments, accomplishments that the electorate earlier this year knew were threatened by the hostility or mismanagement of the Opposition. Foremost is Medicare. Its establishment in 1984 spelled adequate health care for two million people previously denied. The misery of a United States style system of class based discrimination ceased. This was definitely threatened by an interest group dominated Opposition whose health policies have since been decried in the distancing antics of many Opposition spokesmen. Medicare has entailed a certainty of funding, with an appreciation of the link to the ageing of our population. A massive increase has occurred in the numbers treated in our hospitals. The Medicare incentives scheme has engineered growth of day surgery, palliative care and at-home convalescent care. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget major initiatives for training and support of rural general practitioners and improvements in their visits to nursing homes and for emergency after-hours surgery are covered. Schedule fee increases are restrained and the gap is to be relative to that which applied in November 1986. I commend moves on the methadone program and AIDS containment. My own electorate has a disproportionately high aged population-a factor of the 1950s Housing Commission settlement, subsequent pensioner unit construction, and transport proximity. Labor's thrusts to widen the options for the aged and extend the availability of hostel style accommodation are vital. Similarly, our assurance that by mid-1991 no nursing home resident will pay greater than 87.5 per cent of pension has wide support from these people and their families. Regional geriatric assessment services are expanded, dementia grants increased by two-fifths and conversion of self-contained flats to hostel style units encouraged. Recurrent funding will be investigated to analyse its relationship with the needs of more dependent residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The home and community care program epitomised by recent vital grants to the Holroyd municipality for community transport for respite to carers was a Labor triumph of 1984-85. Australia must appreciate the demographic realities that determine an expansion of domiciliary services over a broad front-meals on wheels, home aid, et cetera-and governments must recognise both here and in child-care that the work force has awoken from willing exploitation in the name of humanitarianism. Increasingly, these industries are being associated with greater training and knowledge, with more standardised hours and career paths. The spread of child-care, so vital to industry policy and planning, with home care, has represented a bastion of underpayment and exploitation. Concern with wages growth has to be questioned in the context of a more informed and organised work force. When we speak of child-care we are touching on another area where the reality of the rabble opposite was exposed in a mishmash of contradictory statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor, in contrast, could approach the electorate with a 25 per cent funding rise. It could legitimately claim to be on target for 122,000 places by January next year. It retained credibility when it heralded incentives for industry to move into the field and spoke of a priority for working-class families. Many of the criteria used in priorities for government funded child-care centres are very proper and particularly relevant to my electorate. This Budget means a major increase in fee relief and a related rise in maximum benefit. Additional to the 50,000 non-profit community child-care places will be an expansion of employer provided facilities and further private commercial operators. Fee relief will flow to 90,000 new families. The maximum fee relief of $85 will flow to non-renters with one child who have incomes up to $370 per week. The taper will be adjusted from 17c per dollar for one child and 23c for two, to 10c and 20c respectively. The Opposition is somewhat embarrassed by the expansion of child-care places from 46,000 when it lost government to a level of 250,000 in 1995-96. These moves are crucial to Australia's prosperity and crucial to our employment participation levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the first time in many years the voters of an electorate have sent someone to this House with no ties to a party, to preselectors or to a special interest group. The electorate has given notice that safe seats are becoming a thing of the past and is delivering a message that many in this House will not want to hear. The community has taken the rhetoric of competition and deregulation at face value and is now applying it, to use today's jargon, to the political duopoly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been sent here not only because of dissatisfaction with the Australian political system but also because for a decade the electors of North Sydney have experienced a new and better way of running public affairs-a way that is founded on the principle that people whose lives are affected by a decision must be part of the process of arriving at that decision; a way that delivers a new kind of open, accountable, participatory democracy with expanded public services and reduced taxation; a way that has no place for the secret, centralised decision making by executives of political parties in combination with powerful, unelected, unaccountable interest groups that is now the dominant process in a largely self-serving Australian political system. </PARA>

The forces of change and the ethic of participation do not recognise national boundaries. The recent political upheavals of eastern Europe are no accident. It is also no accident that this Government is the most minority government since Federation, with only 39.4 per cent of the vote; that the membership of political parties is collapsing; that 17 per cent of Australians voted against the major parties; that the number of non-party members has virtually doubled each election in the 1980s in New South Wales; that the Senate has not been controlled by the Government since 1981, and will never be again; that the New South Wales upper House lost executive dominance in 1988; and that the first lower House in Australia not to be dominated by one party has come into existence in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be easy to ascribe these events to the steady slide in social, economic and environmental conditions in the past 20 years; to the increasingly overt nepotism, careerism, cronyism and corruption in our political system highlighted by the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. It would be easy to ascribe it to the cynical multimillion dollar advertising campaigns; to the broken promises; to the blatant centralisation of public decision making; to big business, big unions, big government; to the flaunting of wealth by entrepreneurs in the 1980s, the record sales of Mercedes, the officially sanctioned tax rorts; to bigger salaries for politicians, free cars all round, more overseas trips with increasing retinues at five-star hotels while the general public is told they are living beyond their means, that they have got to work harder and have to tighten their belts. </PARA>
<PARA> Our traditional political duopoly and administrative structures are failing. It is not just a problem of a few bad apples. The system is not delivering and a large section of the community is irrevocably alienated. It may seem unfair that the former member for North Sydney had to bear the brunt of all this, but it is certain that in the future there will be further casualties. What sort of future does this small country have with nine governments, 15 Houses of Parliament, 855 politicians and their associated overlapping bureaucracies spewing out truckloads of legislation each year-much of it well-meaning but cumulatively self-defeating? It is a shambling structure derived from a century-old parochial compromise corrupted by unelected interest groups, party executives, an elitist private-not public-service, and gerrymandered voting systems. An anachronistic lunacy in which all political parties had a vested interest was the description applied to it by our present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) some years ago. That may be true, but an increasing number of people are beginning to have other ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> Does anyone really think Australia can be legitimately run by a Government that commands only 39.4 per cent of the vote but 52.7 per cent of the seats in this House and where 17 per cent of voters who did not vote for the major parties were rewarded with 0.7 per cent of the seats? It may be democracy the Bjelke/Richardson way but it is a long way from any notion of fairness or a real expression of the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the gerrymander, most people are aware that this House has little public purpose. As a former Clerk of the House, J. A. Pettifer, said in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA>The party system has overwhelmed the Westminster system and destroyed its original checks and balances. </PARA>
<PARA>A decade later the McIntosh study confirmed that even 80 per cent of the members of this House believe that it is simply a rubber stamp. Legislation, decided mostly by the unelected in private, is agreed to as a formality. There is no separation of executive and parliament; no real accountability of the executive or bureaucracy, which is fundamental to the democratic system. Advocates of the reform of parliament have suggested such titivations as additional staff for members, more private members time, procedural reform, an expanded committee system, longer sitting times, more free votes, televising of Parliament, and electronic voting. As for the latter, the simplest system would be for only the party whips and myself to vote-and, of course, any party member who wishes to commit harikari by crossing the floor. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these so-called reforms avoid the issue. The issue is control of Parliament by five or six people through the rigid party system. This was starkly confirmed recently when only about five phone calls were necessary to commit our defence forces to a possible war in the Middle East. The issue is centralisation of power and government by special interest and elitism to the point where probably 142 of 148 members of this House, and certainly the public, have little or no input into public decision making, except for a little `chook feeding' by way of pacification. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, no suggestion that things would be much different if a change of government occurred. The Opposition in this House is only a more disorganised version of the Labor Party in terms of centralised power. The fact is that after nine elections in 18 years, the community has learnt that government by rejection is comparatively futile. A change of government means more of the same, irrespective of election rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Our two-airline political system not only is failing to deliver, but also is working consistently against building public support and consensus for the necessary restructuring if Australia is going to compete in the global village. Dr Ian Marsh of the Australian Graduate School of Management encapsulated the position when he recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . issues can never be discussed short of a challenge to the competence of the current government-Parliament can never debate major strategic issues without partisan allegiances coming to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary committees in other democratic countries can initiate major structural changes on a consensus basis. Here such committees are carefully husbanded to relatively minor tasks by ministerial advisers with the blessing and manipulation of Sir Humphrey and his legions. </PARA>
<PARA> Two-party politics creates an almost overwhelming imperative for oppositions to pander to sectional selfishness and, as a result, constrain themselves should they gain the government benches. Incentives to oppose are multiplied, differences are magnified and spurious choices are falsely propagated. The reversal of party positions on the consumption tax issue is a stark example of the sterile and hypocritical nature of the adversarial system. </PARA>
<PARA> The duopoly of the two-party system creates many distortions, such as the fiction that members can represent their electorates when ultimately they can only represent their party executives; the exclusion of most of the community from many key positions in the Public Service and in parliament as those positions are remorselessly filled with groupies, family and former ministerial staff; the continual faction and leadership struggles; the fiction that Ministers can also be local members; the fact that ministerial competence is largely accidental, given the present preselection process; and the increasing propensity of the political parties to fund their activities from the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, governments are out of touch with the community. The multifunction polis, large-scale public asset disposal, woodchipping of native forests, the failure to stop major drug promotion and exploitation, foreign ownership, immigration policy, and $900,000 dining rooms are but a few examples of where Government policies did not have majority support, irrespective of the merits of such policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that policy can no longer be driven by special interest and elitism. It can only be effectively arrived at and implemented by public participation in the decision-making process. The common and cynical assumption among the elite is that the necessary hard decisions for change can only be taken against the popular will and must be taken by stealth, and taken early, so that the public will have time to either forget them or appreciate their inherent wisdom before the next election. This assumption shows contempt for the public and the democratic system and it just does not work. </PARA>
<PARA> Reform must commence with the acceptance by government and its bureaucracies of the fundamental principle of democracy, which is that a decision made by the whole community will be right more often than a minority decision taken by an elite group, no matter how wise or altruistic. No group has a mortgage on wisdom or values. Reform must recognise that the system of delegating all rights to a representative or political party every three or four years and then passing judgment on that representative or party is futile. The growth of education, the information explosion and the rate of change have fundamentally made the representative system ineffective and even unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> People must be part of the decision-making process whenever it affects them. We must shift to participatory democracy through a whole range of mechanisms, such as greater use of referendums and acceptance of the people's right to initiate and even veto legislation. The traditional propensity of government and the Public Service to secrecy must be reversed, with an expansion of freedom of information and openness at all levels of administration. The Ombudsman's powers should be widened and public scrutiny and accountability improved at all levels of executive and bureaucratic administration and policy making. The present restriction on freedom of information by exorbitant charges and manipulation of privacy provisions must be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> If principles such as these were adopted, effective electoral, parliamentary and constitutional reform could commence. But if change is attempted on its traditional basis of seeking advantage on a party or personal basis, we will continue to create such pictures of Dorian Gray as the Australian Capital Territory Government. Government will continue to be distrusted and harassed at every turn. Unless governments-Federal, State or local-can command public respect and confidence, they are largely ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA> Most governments and representatives in Australia are held in increasing disrepute by the community. It affects all levels of administration and it will not be reversed by cosmetics. It can only be overcome by governments setting an example to the community, by controlling their self-serving nature, the `Taj Mahals', and the constant increases in lurks and perks which have permeated almost every level of Australian society, from the debauched tax system to the ritual overseas junket, reinforcing a `greed is good' materialist philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> Electoral reform must be implemented, not on the basis of short term electoral advantage, but on the basis of fairness and one vote, one value. That means the eventual abandonment of our traditional gerrymanders and single member constituencies which constantly produce electoral distortions. The last Queensland election showed that even the worst traditional gerrymander pales into insignificance compared to single member seat distortion. Labor won 60 per cent of the seats with 50 per cent of the vote; the Nationals won three times as many seats as the Liberals with the same vote. Even after preference distribution, three minority Federal governments have been formed since 1961. </PARA>
<PARA> The only fair system operating in Australia is the Hare Clark system in Tasmania. Not only does it invariably reflect the will of the people, but it also eliminates how-to-vote distribution, by-elections, donkey voting and boundary manipulation, and enables the people as a whole to share in party preselection. What this means is parliament as a true reflection of a democratic, pluralist society and the end of executive domination. To avoid continual minority government and instability, the executive government should, ideally, be removed from parliament and elected directly by the people. Members of parliament could then represent their constituencies and a proper separation of powers and the monitoring of the executive could be achieved. The increasing non-party vote at all levels of government-local, State and Federal-over the last decade is the writing on the wall for reform and no amount of public relations or electoral manipulation will stop the trend. </PARA>
<PARA> With little public comment the Senate has been transformed. It was created at Federation as a States House but for most of its life it has been a party House. Now it is more representative of the community than the lower House. Yet the changing role of the Senate and its conversion to a people's House is marred by the massive gerrymander, with almost 13 New South Wales votes equalling one Tasmanian vote. Irrespective of whatever short term benefits exist in this situation, the present and likely future position of a meaningless lower House and an undemocratic Senate is not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal has been said about the need for rationalisation of the overlapping bureaucracies at the three levels of government and the need for uniform standards, particularly in respect of transport, corporate regulation, the environment and the legal system-all of which are certainly to be welcomed. The real surgery, however, is needed for the political and administrative structure. Constitutional reform will not come by any Whitlamesque version of centralised power imposed from above or dreams of the disappearance of the States. None of the three levels of government will or should disappear. There is always a national, a regional and a local interest which must be recognised but there is no reason why colonial State borders should leave so many genuine regions of Australia effectively unrepresented or why we need full-blooded, antiquated Westminster systems at State level. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of overgovernment and over-representation at State level is quite grotesque: 631 members of Parliament and their associated bureaucracies, an array of mouseketeers unparalleled in any other country. Any sensible reforms could at least halve this burden. Conversely, many of the bloated local government bodies on the perimeters of Sydney and Melbourne should be reduced to population units of around 50,000, at which level any real local government ends. The necessary redistribution of both power and functions must be based on decentralisation to the lowest appropriate level. </PARA>
<PARA> The shift to participatory democracy by such measures as direct election of prime ministers, premiers and mayors; the separation of executives and legislatures; increased use of referenda and citizen initiated referenda; electoral reform; fixed four-year terms of office and proper levels of representation together with maximum open government and public participation to build a consensus is the only possible way to reform. </PARA>
<PARA> A loss of trust in the nation's leaders and political system and a country edging towards economic and ethical bankruptcy-this is `the big picture' facing our community. It is a community with accelerating selfishness, hedonism, crime, violence, vandalism, corporate fraud, tax fraud, insurance fraud, welfare fraud and corruption at all levels-a society fracturing into tunnel vision, self-interest groups on a survival-of-the-fittest basis with centralisation of power and money on one hand and a rapidly developing underclass on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Our political system offers us an endless cycle of short term solutions, cynical promises, tax bribes to strategic voting groups, selling the future to pay for today's excesses, ideological leaps into the unknown, futile adversary conflict, and electoral manipulation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no national goals or directions and without these we are rudderless. We need a stocktake and a development of national goals based on common basic values and an understanding that transcends barriers of race, religion, sex or status with equity, justice and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> These goals can only be reached by the involvement of the community as a whole, by a community that accepts individual responsibility and is willing to change direction and begin the process of reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my case it has been a long spell between maiden speeches but I must say it is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support this motion for the adoption of the Federal Budget. At the outset, I wish to warmly thank the electors of Kingsford-Smith for the confidence they have shown in electing me to represent them in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From boyhood I have aspired to what I consider the greatest of honours, that of carrying Labor's colours as its Parliamentary representative. To the rank and file membership of our great Party who bestowed this honour upon me, I wish to record my profound gratitude. My time in this House will be devoted to serving their interests and the high ideals of our Party. </PARA>
<PARA> My transition from State to national politics would not have been possible without the enormous assistance of my campaign director, Mr Pat Williams, who, as in so many earlier campaigns, never faltered in his professionalism. His personal guidance and the hard work of each member of the campaign team could not have been greater. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of allowing me to pursue my political aspirations here in Canberra will be borne by my wife, Tricia, and young sons, Anthony and Christopher. I want to acknowledge their support and the personal sacrifice of family life which is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the people of Kingsford-Smith, I wish to pay tribute to my predecessor, the Honourable Lionel Bowen. For four decades Lionel devoted himself to serving his constituents, first in local government, then in New South Wales State politics and then as a member of this House. His legacy is of legendary dimension. No politician could depart public life more widely admired. No Prime Minister could have had a finer deputy to support him. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1968 I nominated for ALP preselection for Kingsford-Smith with a view to succeeding the then retiring member, Dan Curtin. I subsequently withdrew that nomination in favour of Lionel Bowen and went instead to take Lionel's place in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. After more than 20 years it gives me a great deal of pleasure to take my place here in this chamber. When asked, I have likened it to finally being promoted to the first division. </PARA>
<PARA> In this, the highest political forum in the land, there can of course be no greater issue to discuss than the direction of national economic policy as set out in the annual Budget. While some commentators would have us believe that there has been a narrowing of the differences between the major parties, the debate over the 1990 Budget dispels this notion. For once again, the traditional differences over the role of government and how its responsibilities should be financed are plain for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA> Significant divisions relating to fiscal, monetary and wages policies stand out. In 1990 it is instructive to compare the past seven years of Labor rule with the previous seven years of coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA> For whilst the Opposition would like us to ignore history, our Government policies must be viewed against the background of the economic mess we inherited from the coalition in 1983. The Australian economy had experienced negative growth for the previous 12 months, with unemployment over 10 per cent, inflation running at over 11 per cent and the forward estimates forecasting a Budget deficit of $9.6 billion for the 1982-83 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would have the Australian electorate believe this is irrelevant and yet, seven years on, I see the architects of that disastrous period-the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)-taking pride of place in the supposedly revitalised Opposition benches. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the honourable member for Bennelong as shadow Minister for industrial relations, is particularly ironic given that it was he as Treasurer who presided over the wage explosion of 1981-82 which so exacerbated the following year's downturn. Having left it to our Government to correct their mistakes, they now seek a second chance. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983, our Government was elected with a mandate to revitalise the economy. It was epitomised by our campaign theme, `recovery, reconstruction and reconciliation'. The latter referred to the Accord, which was to form the basis of a new era of industrial peace and wage moderation, a new era vital if the benefits of recovery were not to be dissipated by another 1982 style wages explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience shows that the Accord has been extremely successful in achieving those dual objectives of industrial peace and wage moderation. Industrial disputation has been at record lows, real unit labour costs have declined and in more recent times productivity has been boosted by the elimination of many of the restrictive work practices. As a result, employment growth reached unprecedented levels with 1.6 million new jobs created in that seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> When one stops to consider the context in which wage moderation was achieved, the merits of the Accord are even greater; for our seven years in Government have been characterised by economic growth rates well in excess of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average. Although this stemmed initially from a fiscal injection by the Government, in latter years we have seen the public sector to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio decline to early 1970 levels-that is, to levels which prevailed before the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA> This highlights how the Fraser economic team-the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Bennelong-shirked the tough spending decisions in spite of all the talk of razor gangs and the like. It seems to me that the razor was either blunt or it was directed to colleagues rather than spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Our fiscal policies in contrast-quite unlike those of Fraser-have involved concrete decisions rather than hollow rhetoric. Some of those decisions, such as the recent changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), have not always been popular but they have always been fair. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget the results are there for all to see. We have a record surplus of $8.107 billion despite a cyclical downturn and despite the fact that the coalition handed us a $9.6 billion deficit just seven years ago. The ratio of government expenditure to gross domestic product sits at 23.5 per cent as opposed to the 30 per cent which prevailed in the last years of the Fraser Government. The ratio of revenue to GDP has fallen to 25.5 per cent, making Australia the third lowest taxing country in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. All this has come from a government which has simultaneously boosted expenditure on science and education and indexed welfare benefits for those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important legacy of this fiscal turnaround has been to reduce the burden of government debt that future generations will face. This year the Commonwealth will repay $7 billion in debt and the ratio of Commonwealth debt to GDP will fall from 13.1 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The Government has to date repaid over $4 billion in foreign currency denominated debt, almost completely offsetting the $4.5 billion which was borrowed in the Fraser years. The resultant interest savings have enabled our Government to maintain a range of essential welfare benefits which the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House and says he wishes to destroy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's fiscal discipline has ensured that once again the public sector places no burden on private savings. Indeed the Hawke Government has made a zero public sector borrowing requirement an article of faith. In sticking to this commitment the Government has freed up savings for private sector investment. While the private sector has not always invested wisely, there is no doubt that the Government's discipline has helped to generate the spurt of private sector growth which has so characterised the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this period of private sector expansion generated a rapid increase in employment and investment it also served to underline many of the structural deficiencies in the Australian economy, deficiencies neglected for years and years by do nothing conservative politicians. Indeed, many of these problems can be directly attributed to the policies of the Menzies-McEwen era. It was left to a Labor Government to face up to the reality of an Australia living beyond its means, relying on foreign savings and unprocessed primary exports to sustain inflated living standards. Our Government has been the first to recognise, let alone deal with, this reality and has taken positive measures to address it. </PARA>
<PARA> The rigid enforcing of public savings, the expansion of superannuation and the introduction of dividend imputation have all helped to improve our national savings performance. Meanwhile, the Government has sought to create an internationally competitive manufacturing sector by phasing out the McEwen style of protection and by rationalising the workplace through the accord process. We are now taking steps to improve the performance of public sector enterprises and proposing a major boost to expenditure on national infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> We have recognised that such an enormous transition of the Australian economy will take time and we have not bombarded the electorate with cheap, simplistic solutions. For that reason, the electorate has returned this Government again and again in the face of the cynical bribes and simplistic solutions proposed by the Opposition. Its recent attempts to portray a consumption tax, labour market deregulation and wholesale privatisation as the answer to all our problems show that the same old economic witchdoctors are still in business. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are their solutions simplistic, they are often quite untenable. Nowhere is that better underlined than with the Opposition's proposal of late to sell Telecom to private interests for some $20 billion. The price tag is the equivalent of one-eighteenth of Australia's GDP and yet we are told that Telecom will not be sold to foreign interests. The reality is that such an outlay could be afforded only by foreign interests and Australia would inevitably lose sovereignty over its communications network. The difference between the realistic approach of our Government on these issues and the right-wing ideological commitment of those sitting opposite has never been more clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's favourite catchcry is deregulation, particularly where labour markets are concerned. Yet on the only occasions we have seen this practised in Australia a wage breakout has resulted. We are yet to be told by the Opposition why it will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> Self-regulation is that favourite catchcry of the business community which the Opposition likes to endorse, yet in recent years we have been treated to a number of examples of corporate greed which only underline the need for a vigilant government watchdog. In the form of the Australian Securities Commission, funded in this Budget, we will have such a body. However, the real thrust of any change has to be led by the great many honest businessmen in this country, for the standing of the business community and indeed the standing of the country as a whole has been tarnished by the unscrupulous and negligent activities of a number of high profile individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard and read much about the fundamentally dishonest activities of some entrepreneurs who have come unstuck in recent times. Yet in rightly condemning these unscrupulous individuals, we often overlook the role played by the bankers and the auditors. Whilst it would be stretching matters to describe them as accomplices, there is no doubt that many have been guilty of abject professional negligence. </PARA>
<PARA> On the role of auditors I need go no further than to quote the Australian Financial Review which recently observed:</PARA>
<PARA>For a large number of companies the accounts were absolutely meaningless . . . look at the companies that have gone broke. There were about $8 billion in shareholders' funds which were actually stated in the accounts, signed off by auditors, and subsequently disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Financial Review cited that figure of $8 billion as the actual loss in shareholders' funds, but the real cost in terms of investor confidence is impossible to quantify. For when the public reads that 66 per cent of Rothwells receivables consisted of personal loans to its chief executive-personal loans that he managed to shift off the balance sheet a day before balance date-they must surely question the reliability of the auditors who are supposed to monitor such irregularities. Alternatively, when they hear that much of the National Safety Council's listed assets consisted of mythical containers of safety equipment doubts inevitably arise about the accuracy of any of the financial information which is provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that neither the auditors nor the bankers who loaned against the security of the empty containers bothered to check whether the equipment actually existed smacks of incompetence or just plain laziness. Either way, the professionalism of those involved has to be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The role played by the banks in nearly all of our corporate crashes has also been fundamental. Indeed, one of the most disgraceful features of the 1980s was the development of a regime of fee-driven banking by many of our corporate bankers. This regime was a lot more about structuring complex financial packages-they were packages to justify large up-front charges-than it was about ensuring that money was repaid. In the boom years it guaranteed large short term profits for the institutions involved while the bankers themselves were rewarded with huge salaries based on bonuses and commissions. As dependent as it was on a bull share market-and indeed an ongoing asset inflation-it was a regime unsustainable in the long run. Yet money continued to be lent without regard to capacity to repay. Of course, when the slowdown came the country was treated to the weekly spectre of one entrepreneur after another going to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we are being treated to the spectre of the banks making huge provisions for losses incurred on large loans to these same failed entrepreneurs. As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) correctly observed, it is the banks' existing customers who suffer by being forced to pay higher interest rates while the banks attempt to recoup the losses made on these loans. By doing so, the banks are punishing others for their own breakdown in credit standing. The people who are really suffering today are those who are still in business and they are suffering every day at the hands of the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> In this period of fee-driven recklessness, the records of two high profile banks stand out above all the others. The first is that of the now infamous Tricontinental Ltd, which had the dubious distinction of achieving losses of $2.2 billion on a loan book of $3.8 billion. In the process, the bank's managing director was awarded the title of 1986 Young Executive of the Year. One can only speculate about what criteria were used to determine the winner of the award, but we can be certain of one thing: credit risk was not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other bank which deserves particular recognition is the Hong Kong Bank of Australia Ltd. Its client base is like a who's who of the Australian corporate graveyard. Among them are George Herscu of Hooker Corporation Ltd, Brian Yuill of Spedley Securities Ltd, Lawrie Connell of Rothwells Ltd, Allan Hawkins of Equiticorp Tasman Ltd, John Friedrich of the National Safety Council of Australia-Victoria Division, Bruce Judge of Ariadne and Richard Lew of Estate Mortgage. In more recent times we had the same bank, the Hong Kong Bank, to thank for the financial package for the Harlin Holdings move on Elders IXL Ltd, a move which, of course, underlines the pitfalls of management buy-outs and has done so at the cost of the besieged former President of the Liberal Party. But for all of this the Bank's chief executive achieved an unprecedented salary in the boom years and was said to have earned commission of some $10m. Now that the fallout of these irresponsible lending practices is clear, all Australians are paying for the damage to our country's business reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised these matters in the time available to me today because they adversely affect the lives of all Australians. My own electorate of Kingsford-Smith covers much of the industrial heartland of Sydney. Here small business men and women are facing extortionate bank overdraft rates that threaten their very survival. Large manufacturing enterprises are facing a bank imposed credit squeeze which threatens their expansion, their investment plans and in many cases their very survival. Young couples are being forced to pay punitive home loan interest rates as the banks seek to protect their own bottom line. The electors of Kingsford-Smith want to see a fairer society, compassionate and caring for those most in need. They have sent me to Canberra to speak up on their behalf. It is my intention to do just that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I thank the House. If anyone ever doubted the necessity of having such a guarantee in place, such doubts should have been cast aside by the recent civil warfare between the Xhosas and the Zulus, as they jockey for the dominant position as to which will have the major say in ruling South Africa. The Xhosas, through the African National Congress (ANC), seem to want a one-party state with them in charge, but Buthelezi's Zulus are not going to be denied their rightful slice of the action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because South Africa is almost uniquely complex in its ethnic, social and tribal groupings, we should not be surprised to see some unexpected results turn up in the ballot box in such an election. For example, the Asians, who have been very successful in South Africa and certainly know on which side their bread is buttered, could well side with the whites at voting time. Likewise, but for somewhat different reasons, the large coloured population may tend in this direction as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, the nine main black groupings will be expected to vote for their own candidates with, of course, the Zulus, totalling 7.3 million, comprising the major single group. Probably only after a negotiated coalition of alliances will anyone be able to claim a majority and a mandate to govern. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, and unrealistically, the Australian Government does not see it that way. It says something about the deficiencies of this Government that, while the rest of the world is monitoring and encouraging these changes, we are pursuing an infantile, immature and out-of-date ideological policy that is hindering change rather than assisting it. </PARA>
<PARA> In his simple mind, Senator Evans portrays the problem as a struggle between conservative Afrikaaner whites on the one side and Mandela's left-leaning blacks on the other. I guess that is how out of touch one becomes when one refuses even to visit South Africa to see for oneself what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The blacks are made up of several distinct groups, all with different allegiances. The Zulus, led by Chief Mangosutho Buthelezi, are the biggest group, and their Inkatha movement has the largest membership of any organisation in South Africa. Naturally they must be a key element in any negotiated deal, but our Government not only ignores them but also has refused to have Buthelezi in Australia. No doubt this is because Buthelezi supports moderation instead of violence, espouses free enterprise instead of socialism and advocates free trade instead of sanctions. Such notions do not sit well with the radical socialist agenda the Australian Labor Party would like to see put in place in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the vast majority of South Africans, including more than 80 per cent of blacks, according to opinion polls, are opposed to sanctions, our Government still supports such restrictions. Never mind that these very same sanctions hurt black people the most because it puts them out of jobs, destroys their chance to better themselves and condemns their families to poverty. That is not a serious consideration with members of this Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) acknowledged and endorsed this very scenario when the Government funded and launched Colin Ovenden's book Apartheid in International Finance. A description of this very scenario can be found on page 187. The Government never realises that it is very wrong and patronising to peddle, from thousands of kilometres away, the fiction that blacks are all waiting breathlessly to give up their jobs just to further some imagined cause of Senator Evans. If this were the case surely they would have voluntarily given up their jobs long ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I have recently read a speech given by Helen Suzman regarding this very matter. I remind the House that during her 36 years as a member of the South African Parliament she opposed and voted against every apartheid measure to go through that Parliament. Her courage and foresight through those decades, long before apartheid became a trendy issue, is an example for us all. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, of course, the South African Parliament has repealed most of what was originally passed, much to the wry satisfaction of Helen Suzman. However, this remarkable woman adamantly claims that these changes have been largely due to the force of business and economic factors within South Africa, and not to sanctions, as this misguided Government and its coterie of small-minded advisers claim. In fact, many believe that sanctions and disinvestment, apart from hurting the black people themselves, and certainly not being wanted by most of them, are counterproductive in that they are making it harder to abolish apartheid. These ill-advised punitive measures are setting back the welcome reforms we are all so eager to see in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be obvious that the political power and influence for the black majority is dependent on economic power. Ethiopia teaches us that. Any action which causes unemployment and poverty, and ultimately frustration and chaos, as our sanctions do, is another blow to black South Africa's emancipation. As Helen Suzman says, because of the violence and confrontation that poverty brings, more money is merely diverted from education and housing to the military and the police to retain law and order. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to think of another country nowadays that still applies sanctions as zealously as we do. In the light of recent reforms, Australia's foreign policy is especially antiquated and immature in comparison with those of other countries. Only two months ago, the President of Zambia, who is also chairman of the frontline states and who has possibly been South Africa's strongest critic, said he was lifting most of his country's remaining sanctions. The ban on the use of South African ports, as well as the ban on rail and road facilities, have all been lifted. Madagascar, another trenchant critic, has also announced it is to do the same, as well as inviting with open arms massive South African tourist investment and development into that country. South African Airways can again fly over that island. The Dutch Government is starting the orderly dismantling of sanctions and has relaxed visa regulations. Italy has eased trade restrictions and Denmark is restoring its ambassador to South Africa. Also Britain has lifted its voluntary ban on new investment.The European community is about to lift its ban on direct investment and its ban on imports of South African coal, steel and Kruger rands. </PARA>
<PARA> Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are inviting South Africa into their markets. They have ceased funding the ANC and told it to solve its problems peacefully. Trade agreements have just been signed with Poland and Hungary. The Soviets have just entered into joint mining ventures with South Africa worth billions of dollars, including a $1 billion arrangement with diamond marketer de Beers. The Moscow Circus is also to tour South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Even intransigent Canada has had a visit from the South African Deputy Foreign Minister. It seems only Australia is continuing to endorse Senator Evans's quaint charade of affected morality. I was pleased to see the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is in the chamber tonight, recently call for the lifting of the petty ban on the issuing of visas from the Australian Embassy in Johannesburg. I was also pleased to see the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), call for the resumption of Qantas Airways Ltd and South African Airways flights between our two countries. I support these calls. After all it seems almost every other airline flies in and out of there. That includes British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Alitalia, Swissair, Varig, Sabena, Iberia, Luxair and others, not to mention many of the African airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> It is high time that some of the myths and hypocrisies about South Africa were exposed. A major one surrounds the role of Mr Mandela and the ANC which is not, I repeat not, the sole spokesperson or legitimate representative of black South Africa. The ANC is largely a Xhosa-based organisation, a group barely half the size of the Zulus. However, because it has been so violent and radical in the past it has become the darling of the Western media and the academic left. At the height of its notoriety it used to reign through fear as it had limited popular appeal and certainly minimal democratic power to give it its much needed legitimacy. It did this by `necklacing' other black people who did not comply with its wishes. For example, a black policeman or a shire employee, because they worked for the South African Government, would be regarded as collaborators. They would tie their hands behind their backs with wire, put a car tyre around their necks, fill it with petrol and set it alight. I have film of ANC cadres doing this to their own people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a pretty sight to watch ordinary decent citizens slowly being burnt to death in this way-screaming in pain, blinded, their eyes popping from the heat of the flames, knowing they will never again be with their loved ones. Mercifully, the frenzied crowd would often bounce half bricks or rocks off the victim's head, so hastening the unconsciousness that precedes death, while ANC flags were hoisted high in triumph by the perpetrators. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful. All this occurs while protesting against the inhumanity and excesses of the white government. Even the generally regarded more radical Pan-African Congress distanced itself from such brutal behaviour. Nelson Mandela's wife, Winnie, used to become quite excited at a necklacing. I can still see her in 1986 on a platform shouting, `With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I went to her first house in Soweto in 1987. I believe it has since been burnt down. She was starting to build a new house just down the road where she lives now. It was believed to have cost something in excess of $US500,000. No doubt this woman is wondering whether or not she is to be called before the courts for her part in the torture and murder of the 14-year-old black youth Stompie Moeketsi Seipei. According to numerous reports, Winnie Mandela had what are called her `Mandela United Football Club' bodyguards, who have committed several acts of thuggery in Soweto, bring four youths to her house. Apparently they were kidnapped from a Soweto Methodist mission house. These youths were brutally assaulted in front of Mrs Mandela while she told them they `were not fit to be alive'. This was in late December 1988. One of the youths testified in court that Mrs Mandela beat him with a sjambok. Two of the others also claimed they were beaten and punched by her. </PARA>
<PARA> Three days after this assault took place, one of the youths, Stompie, was taken away and his partly decomposed body was found in a ditch some time later with three stab wounds in the neck. The `coach' of the Mandela Football Club, Jerry Richardson, has been charged with the murder and sentenced to death for his part in that offence. Forensic experts have testified that human blood was found on the seats of Mrs Mandela's minibus, on a whip taken from her house, and on the walls, floor and ceiling of two outside rooms. As honourable members can gather, the beatings must have been very violent. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that another member of Winnie's football club, Charles Zwane, was only last week convicted of eight attempted murders, arson and illegally possessing a gun, as well as the more serious charge of nine murders, including that of a 13-year-old girl. Presumably, he will be sentenced to death too. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, Winnie Mandela is not too popular with the decent black people in Soweto. The South African Government is also placed in a difficult position, as it does not want Mrs Mandela's actions to jeopardise the delicate negotiations going on at present with the ANC. Her husband is not all that pure either. To westerners, Nelson Mandela is constantly painted as some sort of martyr hero who was wrongly gaoled for his noble actions and beliefs. How quickly the facts are forgotten. After joining the ANC in the early 1950s he soon became known for his radical left wing views. In 1953 he had accused the United States of America of genocide in Korea. In 1958 he wrote that the Marshall Plan was a US plot to gain control of the European economies. He even spoke of the `criminal and greedy appetites of the imperial powers'. He was appointed commander of the ANC's military wing in 1961, and he later underwent a military and revolutionary training course in Algeria. </PARA>
<PARA> He was eventually arrested, and after a nine month trial was found guilty in June 1964 for his part in initiating a grand scheme of sabotage and for the violent overthrow of the South African Government. Even his lawyers admitted that he was guilty of three of the four charges. He and seven others were sentenced to life imprisonment-a light sentence certainly by African standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The saboteurs were convicted of having 105 plans, including those for having foreign forces dropped on South African shores, and for targets to be sabotaged, including power stations, all means of communications, police stations and so on. In addition, plans to build an arsenal of 210,000 hand grenades, 48,000 land mines and some 50 tons of explosives were recovered-enough to wipe Johannesburg off the map. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, Mandela had written a great deal about the virtues of communism and how to implement the communist system. Some of his writings would have done Lenin and Stalin proud. It is all on the record and mostly in his own handwriting for those who may doubt the claim. Of course, even as late as September 1985 Amnesty International affirmed that Nelson Mandela had participated in planning acts of sabotage and inciting violence and so could not be classified as a political prisoner. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all this, I do not believe any reasonable person here would begrudge his being released. It was clearly the right decision at the time. We all truly hope he will be able to play a responsible part in the move towards a truly democratic South Africa. Nevertheless, though we are understandably tolerant of his statements there have been some wildly fluctuating messages coming forth. Even the day before he met George Bush he reaffirmed his support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation's Yasser Arafat, Cuba's Fidel Castro, and even Libya's Colonel Gaddafi. In the face of all this I hope de= Klerk's indulgence will not waiver, and that both Mandela and de Klerk can continue to work together for the greater good. </PARA>
<PARA> I do reiterate though, that the ANC is not the sole representative of black South Africa, far from it. We should also not forget that over two-thirds of the ANC's executive are also members of the South African Communist Party, including the notorious Joe Slovo who is a slavish advocate of the failed doctrines that have bankrupt and oppressed eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANC's so-called `Freedom Charter' supports a strong socialist agenda of nationalisation of property and industry, the same menu that has bankrupted Tanzania, Mozambique and so many other African countries. Surely that is the last thing we want for a new South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than directing all their criticisms at the brave de Klerk, the rest of the world, Australia included, should be putting a bit of pressure on the ANC to reveal exactly what their economic formula is for a post-apartheid South Africa. If it is de Klerk who always has to make the concessions, with nothing ever to show for the ground he is giving, it will be so much harder for him to not only pacify the noisy right, but also allay the fears of the white middle classes. The world, by not requesting a balanced commitment from both sides, and by putting down or ignoring the majority black groups while at the same time elevating the minority ANC, is only making a satisfactory end result that much harder to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is fragile and complex enough as it is, without the constant stream of unhelpful, ignorant and counter-productive nonsense that masquerades as policy forever pouring out of Australia. If we genuinely desire peace and democracy in that country and have the overall welfare of the black people at heart, then we must start to better inform ourselves of the situation over there and formulate our responses accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Normal trade should be resumed and reciprocal investment in both countries encouraged for the mutual benefit of both. As well, sporting contact should be allowed. The Gleneagles Agreement should be scrapped. The document is meaningless. Despite what most people think, the so-called `agreement' was never signed, let alone ratified. It only says, in effect, that each government, acting in a manner that it best thinks fit, should discourage all sporting contact between those countries, including South Africa, where sports are organised on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two further points about the agreement that are worth noting. Firstly, only a government can breach the Gleneagles Agreement, not an individual sportsperson or a sporting body as most believe. Secondly, it clearly says that all sporting contact is to be discouraged. There is no distinction whatsoever allowed to be made between teams or individuals, professionals or amateurs, national representatives or non-representatives, or between one sport and another. Our Government, quite mistakenly, has created these distinctions for its own convenience and so breaches the Agreement almost daily. Quite clearly, the document is a farce and should be rejected forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA> Most blacks are as opposed to sporting boycotts as they are to trade sanctions. This is not surprising. Their soccer players would love to play an international team, their boxers to fight overseas, their world class long distance runners to compete at the Olympics. How does our boycott help these black people? On the other side, show me a Maori rugby player who, given half a chance, would not want to play against the Springboks. Here is one avenue, one outlet, where blacks can equal and surpass their white Afrikaaner brothers, where they can become higher income earners, and where they can gather world accolades for their performances with all the reflected glory that will flow through to their impoverished brothers and children in black townships, thereby ultimately giving them a goal to strive for which they do not presently have. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, divorced from them by the width of the Indian Ocean, never having asked their opinion and never even having been to South Africa to see what is going on there, we sanctimoniously and patronisingly deny them all this from our comfortable position. We say we know best, and the world is a lesser place for our attitudes. So let us resume this contact with South Africa. In that way we can both help and influence it more. I say to this Government by all means let us encourage de Klerk to talk to the ANC, but get some perspective into the scene instead of simply trying to pick who it would like to win just because he or she is a socialist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by offering my congratulations to those honourable members who have had the opportunity to make their maiden speeches today and this evening. The Parliament has certainly gained by the information that has been put forward by those new members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address my remarks to Appropriation Bill (No.1). The issue of social justice is one that has rated highly on this Government's agenda since coming to office in 1983. This Budget has continued that proud record by ensuring that the rights of less well-off Australians are maintained. With such complex arrangements in today's social security framework, the redistribution of benefits requires changes which are by their name just as complicated. There is just no easy solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I say from the outset, however, how disappointed I am at the way some media institutions and so-called professionals have compounded any misunderstandings some people may have had by explaining only the fearful and emotive side of the changes announced in the recent Budget. Nowhere has this been more apparent than with the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that it was the Chifley Labor Government that made the first inroads into the establishment of a pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This is an ethos very much a part of the present Labor Government as well. This has been shown by the changes made to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme since this Government came into office. Despite the rising cost of pharmaceuticals, the Government has maintained free medications covered under the PBS scheme for pensioners and health benefit card holders, large discounts for health care card holders and their dependants, including unemployment beneficiaries and low income earners, and the most basic charge possible to other members of the community requiring prescribed medications. This commitment has meant a tremendous increase in the cost of maintaining the PBS scheme. Even those honourable members opposite would agree that it would be a foolish Government that would pursue the same course of action, regardless of the social and economic consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the Government's case into perspective, the PBS scheme is currently costing the Australian taxpayer about $1,200m a year. With our quickly ageing population this figure will drastically increase so that by 1992 the estimated cost on the current rate of increase would reach some $2 billion. However, the increasing cost to the PBS is not completely due to the ageing population. A large part of the increase over recent years has been due to prescription drift whereby more expensive drugs come on to the PBS list and doctors are increasingly prescribing the new drugs in preference to the ones already on the list. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these two factors, however, a problem of great concern to the Government is the dangerous amount of overprescribing by some chemists and doctors and the resultant stockpile of medication by patients, a problem recognised by the pharmaceutical industry for some time. This was obviously posing an unnecessary burden on the rest of the country because of the millions of dollars it cost every year. Also of particular concern to the Government was the fact that these people were also putting their own lives at risk by taking outdated medications which may either have had no effect on the condition for which they had been prescribed the medications or may had an even more dangerous reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> No matter which way it is viewed, the PBS is clearly not able to continue in its present format. A solution canvassed in some circles was that a suitable level of deterrent be introduced to discourage these people from stocking up on medications. The Government's obvious concern here was that the pensioners' lot would be severely disadvantaged by the extra cost imposed on them, particularly the chronically ill. How ironic it is, then, that the very people who suggested imposing a deterrent against stockpiling are the ones making the most noise about the PBS restructuring for pensioners. The solution would have seen the chronically ill forking out money every time they went for some medication without a cent going back into their pockets. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very much with the welfare of the aged of our community in mind, then, that the Government decided to introduce a $2.50 charge for prescriptions for pensioners to be offset by a complementary $2.50 increase a week in the pension. Overseas experience shows that price disincentives such as the $2.50 up-front payment do act to achieve around a 15 per cent decrease in the usage of the PBS system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's prime goal in arriving at a disincentive to stockpiling medications is not to make anyone's life worse off. The average number of scripts used by pensioners is 27 per year and under the new rules the Government is providing compensation for 52. This means that not only will those people most in need receive their required medication free, but they will also be better off than they were before. The Government clearly recognises that there are some cases where people are currently taking more than one script per week and that, although these people would soon be taken up by the safety net once they reached the $130 worth of medications, they do have special needs. We are therefore currently looking at ways of addressing the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered, though, that the Government is by no means the only player in maintaining the supply of vital medications to those in need. There is a big role to be played here by the medical fraternity itself. In my own electorate office I have had a number of calls from people currently taking more than one script per week. The question to be asked here is whether these people really need to be taking this number of prescriptions. The doctors of the Department of Community Services and Health have found that many of those people currently on multiple prescriptions are not receiving them because their condition dictates it, but rather because their doctors are over-prescribing. In some cases it has even been found that some of the drugs prescribed have completely nullifying effects against each other. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of these changes is a far more efficient PBS scheme, well prepared for the increase in demand on it as we enter the next century. This Government is all about facing up to forthcoming changes and attacking them now while keeping in mind the unique needs of the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA> Before speaking out in criticism of these changes, those honourable members opposite should firstly look at where the problems of increased demand on the PBS began. The signs of an increasing demand were clearly on the wall in the latter part of the Fraser years. In the last five financial years of the Fraser Government, the cost of maintaining the PBS scheme rose from $315.6m in 1978-79 to $506m in 1982-83, a rise of just under $200m. These five years saw the greatest single rises in demand on the PBS in any one year since 1978-79. There was a rise of 25.7 per cent in demand on the PBS in 1981-82 over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Opposition do to prepare Australia for the great demand in pharmaceuticals that now confronts us? It did absolutely nothing. In contrast, the changes detailed in this year's Budget not only address the need for restructuring within the PBS, but of equal importance they cater for the adequate provision of medications for the elderly and less well-off, ensuring that the ideal eventually has been maintained. Contrary to the views of some, under the new PBS scheme social justice has indeed been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners, because of their plight, have gained all the cameras' attention in the past few weeks but other less well-off groups throughout the community will also benefit from the PBS changes. The eligibility criteria for the health care card which provides concessional pharmaceutical benefits will be raised to the same level as the family allowance supplement (FAS). This initiative will remove the present anomaly under which some low income families are eligible for part FAS but not concessional pharmaceutical benefits. As a result, low income families will receive a substantial reduction in prescription costs from a maximum of $11 to $2.50. </PARA>
<PARA> I found in my own electorate that the campaigns of misinformation on some changes announced in the Budget are just as prevalent concerning the new deeming rule for pensioners' savings accounts. We on this side of the House recognise that for many pensioners old habits die hard and that some people will take time to come to grips with the changes. </PARA>
<PARA> What this all comes down to, though, is the ever-widening gap between what banks are prepared to give their customers in return for leaving their savings with them and what they charge customers wanting to borrow money. A common response has been, `But they always look after me and they are so friendly towards me'. To those people I say this: Like the Sydney chemists who recently gained notoriety for overcharging their patients on PBS items, I, too, would greet all my customers with a smile if I was lending out their money for three and sometimes four times the amount of interest that I was giving them on their savings. In some cases the banks have become no more than smiling assassins of the financial highways. </PARA>
<PARA> Before looking at the implications of the one change that has grabbed all the sensational headlines in the past few weeks, let us look at the proud record of this Government in caring for pensioners. When this Government came to office, the legacy of the previous coalition Government had pensioners receiving a mere $77.25 a week, or 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. Today, the standard pension rate is $141.20 per week, or 25.3 per cent of average weekly earnings, thus surpassing the goal of this Government to make the standard pension payment at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> For a married couple the combined pension rate has increased from $128.80 a week to $235.40 a week. In real terms, after allowing for inflation, both the standard and combined pension rates have increased by 9.9 per cent since March 1983, compared to a fall of 2.4 per cent under the previous Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not been content merely to increase the amount of money going into pensioners' pockets each week. In 1987, the Government brought about a greater degree of flexibility and earning capacity for pensioners with the introduction of the pensioner earnings credit scheme. This scheme allows maximum-rate pensioners to undertake seasonal or casual employment with earnings above the free area for short periods without a reduction in pension. The scheme provides encouragement for pensioners to supplement their income. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, this Government's ability to plan ahead for the multitude of changes that will face Australia into the next century has not only become its hallmark, but has stood us clearly apart from honourable members opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there are 1.9 million people in Australia over the age of 65. By the year 2021 this number will have risen to approximately 3.9 million. This represents an increase in the proportion of this age group in our population of 18 per cent. As was the case with the conservatives' lack of determination to face up to this dramatic change in the case of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, so, too, has it been the case in the demand on pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the increased demand on the age pension itself, there are also the equally important associated areas of housing, community services and health, some aspects of which I have already addressed. The clearest example of the difference in approach to this problem between this Labor Government and previous coalition governments is the three-stage reform plan included in last year's publication Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century. The first stage of this plan, which came into effect in July of this year, provided for the income test-free area for pensions to be made 100 per cent tax free. This eliminated the tax payable on non-pension income within the pension-free area and simplified the way in which the social security system interacts with the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> The second stage of the Better Incomes plan, which will come into effect from 1 July 1991, is to index annually the income test-free area for social security and veterans' affairs pensioners, something that has never been done before by any Federal government. This will continue to be 100 per cent tax free. Maintaining pensioners' incomes in real terms provides for a great deal of financial stability for pensioners in organising their finances. </PARA>
<PARA> The third stage of this Government's reform will address the position of pensioners who have income above the income test-free area, that is, part-rate pensioners. Another integral part of the Government's overall planning for the welfare of our retirees is the decision that by 1995 all age and service pensioners, both full-rate and part-rate, will be removed from the tax system, with part-rate pensioners being subject only to the withdrawal rate on their pension entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA> To reduce the demand on Government provided pensions as we enter the next century, a heavy emphasis has also been placed on award based superannuation. The deeming rule announced in this year's Budget is very much a continuation down that path of preparing Australia for the next century. What do we get from the critics-more alarmist talk and fearmongering questions about people having their pension entitlement reduced and losing their health care entitlements and fringe benefits? That has got to be rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> The one question regarding the deeming provisions that has not yet been asked, but which I will take up today, is why the Opposition is supporting the very people preventing pensioners from earning a decent rate of interest on their savings. The answer is clear. When it comes down to a choice of either defending the rights of pensioners to a decent level of weekly disposable income or siding with the smiling assassins in the banks who are making record annual profits, while at the same time lending out pensioners' investments at around 10 per cent more than they are giving, the Opposition's allegiance clearly lies with the banks. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian Associated Press report of 22 August 1990 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's banks could lose tens of millions a year if pensioners move their savings from low interest accounts into high interest accounts, according to a major commercial bank. The bank spokesman, who did not want his institution identified, said those most likely to be hardest hit by changes affecting pensioners savings announced in last night's Federal Budget were the Commonwealth and state banks, which had a high proportion of low interest deposit account accounts. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder the spokesman did not want his bank identified. For too long the banks have been exploiting the older members of our community who only seek security for their savings. With the new rules, this will cease. </PARA>
<PARA> How many people will be affected by the deeming provisions? Contrary to the ramblings of some, only one in eight pensioners and beneficiaries need be concerned by the new provisions. The point ignored in much of the coverage on the deeming provisions is that they very much tie in with both the income test-free areas and earning limits for fringe benefits for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Take the case of the single pensioner. With no additional income apart from the pension, this person would have to have more than $20,000 in the bank before his pension would be affected at all. A person in this position would need to have more than $51,400 in savings accounts before he would lose entitlements to a pharmaceutical benefits health (PBH) card entitling him to fringe benefits such as discounts on telephone accounts, rates charges at a local level and car registration charges at State level. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another example highlighting the fairness of the deeming provisions. Take the case of a single pensioner with the same amount of savings who has a part-time job mowing lawns or ironing which earns him some $40 a week. Even though this person's pension is reduced because the deemed income capacity of savings, combined with job earnings, places him over the income test-free area, his weekly disposable income would be $192.71 compared with the $181.20 he was earning before the changes. This means an increase in disposable income of $11.51 a week, or just under $600 per year. To lose entitlement to a pharmaceutical benefits health card, someone in this position would need to have more than $30,600 in bank deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> For married pensioner couples the case is similar. Pensioner couples with no additional income apart from the pension, to be affected at all by the provisions, would need to have more than $36,000. To lose entitlements to a PBH card, a couple would need to have more than $87,280 in bank deposits. Pensioner couples with $50,000 in savings with an additional income of $70 a week would end up with a weekly disposable income of $336.09, compared with the $305.04 they are currently earning under pre-deeming conditions. That gives these people $30.69 more a week, or more than $1,500 extra each year. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does the extra earning capacity come from? The banks. What has been ignored by the Opposition in its criticism of the changes is the situation we have today and have had for the last few decades where ordinary Australian pensioners and taxpayers have been subsidising bank profits. This money has, in turn, been returned to only a very small number of Australians who are shareholders in banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provisions for deeming have both winners and losers. The losers here, though, are not the pensioners and small savings investors, but the banks. Those with small savings accounts are very much the winners. For a while there will certainly be some profits cut off the bottom line for the banks. This means there will be less pressure on the taxes paid by every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to planning for a fast ageing population, we have two plans: the one put forward by the Government that delivers a comprehensive package of measures that is both sustainable and equitable, addressing all the needs of an older community, or one which is made up of haphazard solutions that serve only to create a greater demand on the public purse in retirement. The provision for an adequate pension and the maintenance of suitable health standards for our population in retirement is one of the highest priorities within the Government's social justice framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Another integral part is the delivery of a flexible tax system that caters for the needs of our diverse work force. This Budget has very much improved on the modifications already done since 1983. It has given the largest percentage tax cut to breadwinners whose income range places them outside the areas of special assistance such as the family allowance supplement. The flat $12 a week wage increase provided in the February 1990 agreement is designed to assist low and middle income earners and is balanced by a rising incidence of tax cuts for middle to upper income earners, levelling out at incomes of $50,000. Of particular assistance to those people on moderate incomes is the decision to apply the 21 per cent tax rate right through the income scale to $21,700, abolishing the 29c rate, which formerly cut out at $17,600. </PARA>
<PARA> To highlight the difference in commitment to people on these moderate levels of income, in 1983 under the Fraser Government a person earning $20,000 a year would have paid 46c in the dollar in tax. Today this level of income has a tax rate of just over half that amount. That is not just rhetoric but social justice in action. A person on this level of income will be in for a tax cut of $4.80 a week. That is equivalent to a pre-tax wage rise of $6.90 a week. The total value of the tax cuts to be paid from 1 January 1991 is $1,200m in 1990-91 and a further $2,500m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government stands proudly on its achievements of delivering a tax scale where taxpayers will continue to pay less tax than if the scale had been indexed for inflation since 1983. The new tax scale will confirm Australia's position as a low tax country by international standards. The latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figures show that in 1988 total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product in Australia was 30.8 per cent. This placed Australia easily at the low tax end of the 24 OECD countries, with only the United States with 29.8 per cent and Turkey with 22.9 per cent having a lower level of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The common theme amongst the initiatives I have spoken on today is social justice and this Government's commitment to that ideal. Upon implementation, these measures will prepare Australia better for the changing needs we face as we enter the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to address honourable members for the first time in this place. I thank the electors of Isaacs, who put their trust in me to represent them. I represent an electorate where a great many people worked very hard to ensure that I made it to Canberra as their representative. I thank the dedicated and tireless workers of my campaign committee, who burnt the midnight oil on many occasions to ensure our success in regaining the seat of Isaacs. I also thank the over 600 volunteers, including many non-Party workers, who manned polling booths and carried out other tasks to ensure our victory. I can assure them that I will do my best within the limitations that this place imposes to ensure that their needs are met and their problems addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to take a moment to thank my family, who have stood behind me during two Federal campaigns and several local government campaigns. To my wife, Christine, and my children, Vanessa, Katrina and David, I say thank you for your tolerance, your patience and your assistance. I also thank the Liberal Party for giving me the opportunity to be here. In a society where high-tech developments and academic information are key concerns, I must say that I am pleased to see that the Isaacs preselection panel recognised the need to balance that with grass roots representation. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate of Isaacs is a sandbelt electorate which is adjacent to Port Phillip Bay and includes all of the city of Mordialloc and some of the cities of Sandringham, Moorabbin, Chelsea and Springvale. The electorate was formed in 1948 as a result of redistribution, and has been represented by a number of members, to whom I pay my respects for their past contributions. I consider it a great honour to represent in this place the people of Isaacs and, indeed, a great privilege to represent an electorate named after Sir Isaac Isaacs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind honourable members that Sir Isaac Isaacs was one of the founding fathers of the Commonwealth of Australia and made a great contribution to this nation as a leading State and Federal politician, a prominent barrister, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and, finally, as the first Australian-born Governor-General. Sir Isaac Isaacs, in a career that spanned more than 60 years, took part in many of the most important developments in Australia's history. Not the least was his pioneering role in the Federation movement alongside men like Deakin, Kingston and Higgins. Of course, he played a substantial role in the development of Australia's Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> We are fortunate to have such a fine and stable foundation. In building upon that foundation, we have come a long way since Federation. That which has been passed on to us to hold in custody for future generations has been fought for by many. Others have provided the eternal sacrifice and some have provided blood, sweat and tears. All of this has provided opportunities; it has provided prosperity; it has provided freedom; and it has provided one of the world's most stable democracies. But this nation over which we hold custody can continue to provide these benefits only if we as a people are prepared to stand up and be counted. We must be prepared to cast aside blind political loyalties and obsolete political ideology and recognise the urgency with which we must turn around the economic demise of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer honourable members back to 1970, in fact to 12 March 1970, when a previous member for Isaacs, Mr David Hamer, made his maiden speech in this place. I quote from that speech:</PARA>
<PARA>We must question where we are going and where we wish to go. Not the least of these fields of critical inquiry must be the future of our manufacturing industry which today employs nearly one-third of our national work force. One of the facts we have to face is that we must increase our exports if we are to achieve our expectations of growth. The Export Development Council recently forecast that we have seven years in which to double our exports if we are to be able to pay for the imports necessary to sustain our economic growth at the present rate. No matter how high we set our expectations from minerals and from agricultural products, a very substantial gap will have to be filled by manufactured exports and can be filled in no other way. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of those are words which I, as a new member for Isaacs, could repeat today. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, when this Government and this Treasurer (Mr Keating) came to office, the deficit in the balance of payments on the current account was $6,794m. In 1989-90, under the very same Treasurer, that deficit has ballooned to a massive $20,729m, and it will continue to rise because this Government is not in touch with economic realities. Through its mix of academic purists, hard-headed unionists and socialists, the Government has forgotten who provides for this country's services. It is not the Government that provides the money for the needy, for education, for defence or for the massive public service of this country; it is the men and women who make up this country's work force and those men and women who run the businesses. They are the ones who pay the taxes to allow the cogs of government to turn, and they are the people who bear the brunt of the tax increases when this Government gets it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need to take a fresh look at where we are headed and what we want to achieve. I regularly see those who support the needy asking for more government assistance, without asking where the money is coming from. I regularly see people who question the fact that businesses are actually making a profit. I ask: where do these people think the money is coming from to pay for these programs and these services? I believe it is time we got our priorities right. Government can provide assistance only when businesses and individuals are in a position to pay taxes, and this can happen only if suitable policies are put in place that allow profits to be made and wages to be paid. They go hand in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to succeed we need conciliation, not confrontation. We need the opportunity for enterprise bargaining-real enterprise bargaining where employers and employees can determine their future together. Successful policies will reap the rewards for the employee in the form of earnings; for the businesses in the form of profits; for the Government in the form of tax collections; and for those who receive assistance and services in the knowledge that the government programs will continue and can be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> To those organisations in my electorate which need assistance, and I know there are many, I will fight to ensure that they get maximum support. I assure the people of Isaacs and, in particular, those in need that I will push this Government wherever and whenever possible to ensure that their needs are met and their problems are addressed. I will push this Government to ensure that this generation of children and the next will have the opportunities that we had in our youth -opportunities that are sadly missing today. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to know a little bit about the needy. I come from a low income family. As a kid, I lived in a tent and a caravan for a number of years. I know what it is like to go to school with your trousers patched and to be hungry because the weekly pay packet had run out. But at least then the opportunities were there to better oneself and to achieve. But in this, the last decade of the twentieth century, with all our technological advances and social developments, these problems should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this country needs leadership, a sense of direction and courage as it approaches the twenty-first century. In this Budget, the Government has exhibited very little of these objectives. The Government's leadership should have seen real privatisation of a number of government bodies, but all it has done is produce a Clayton's privatisation to get its mates in Victoria off the hook. Government direction would have seen programs setting out plans until the turn of the century, but it was not forthcoming-and, based on the promises to solve child poverty, I can understand why. Government courage would have seen this Government free itself of the accord, which is the major contributor to this country's inflation, but it could not bring itself to tell the Australian Council of Trade Unions that for the financial survival of this country the arrangements must be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> On all counts this Government has wimped out. It has lost its way. It has done so many deals with unions, big business and entrepreneurs that it has a ball and chain around its neck which it cannot remove. This Government is in trouble because its policies are coming home to roost. </PARA>
<PARA> But for now, I would like to turn my attention to another area in which I have been involved over many years. Of interest may be the fact that I am one of very few members in this place who have come from a manufacturing background. This is an industry which I believe we must support and continue to develop if we are to get this country back on its feet. We must look at exporting and import replacement if we are to solve the current balance of trade situation. We must look at value adding to our raw materials and our exports to ensure that we are getting value for them, and it is to that end that I would like to address some of the problems facing businesses in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it difficult to accept that in this country, which is a major iron ore supplier and a steel producer, Australian manufacturers are left at the bottom of the heap when it comes to price and steel supply times. It may suit statistical whiz kids to sit behind their computers and look at the increases in export sales we are achieving in raw materials, but it would impress them even more if they could look at the imports we could replace or the exports we could generate if only our manufacturers were able to purchase steel at the prices we are selling it to our competitors. It is difficult to expect manufacturers in this country to compete when they are forced to buy through distributors because their orders are not an economic quantity and they find that the very same steel in the very same uneconomic quantities is being supplied to overseas clients at hundreds of dollars less than our manufacturers can acquire it here. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it disheartening that a confectionary manufacturer in my electorate of Isaacs is experiencing difficulty competing with imported confectionary because of the high price that he has to pay for sugar. He tells me that it is not so bad when one is exporting one's product because of the duty drawback. I find it difficult to believe that, as a major sugar producing nation, it is more economical for companies in this country wishing to export their products to import their sugar. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it even more difficult to understand how much of this sugar is of Australian origin, yet can be imported cheaper than the sugar which is available from Australian manufacturers, even after paying the import tariffs and freighting costs. I quote from a report jointly prepared by the Australian Soft Drink Association, the Ice Cream Manufacturers Federation and the Confectionary Manufacturers of Australia. This report was recently forwarded to the Queensland sugar industry working party. That report says:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that Australian food and beverage processes are, for commercial reasons, compelled to import sugar for manufacture of export product is a national embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA>I would call it a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> But let me not stop there. There are machinery manufacturers in my area who take pride in building Australian machinery to send overseas. They are losing their markets to other exporters who choose to buy their components from overseas and use the duty drawback on the products when they leave our shores. Is this the way we should treat people who have their hearts in this country? Is this the way we should treat those who would employ our youth and give them a trade? Without a healthy manufacturing industry in this country, who would provide export dollars to solve our balance of payment problems? Who would provide the taxes to sustain our needy and educate our nation to provide opportunities for future generations?</PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate a company has established a plant producing dehydrated beef powder. The factory is fully approved by the Victorian Department of Labour and Industry. The product complies in every respect with the Australian food regulations. The product is accepted by major international food product companies in Australia. The company has identified companies in South East Asia which are prepared to take its product. A submission that the company prepared for me says that, although there are no major problems with the construction of the meat factory, it fails to meet the regulations for export meat premises because in the main it does not provide for, first, a meat inspectors' office; secondly, a dry ingredients store; thirdly, a packages store; fourthly, a clean materials store; and, fifthly, an existing separate amenities block is not conveniently located and does not meet all the regulations covering export meat premises amenities. </PARA>
<PARA> The business is prepared to put in suitable portable buildings to enable it to have the time to organise, firstly, council permits and approvals and, secondly, the finance for the $300,000 that this work will cost. The company is prepared to put in these funds to make sure that it gets the export work. I have not even looked at businesses outside my electorate of Isaacs, but I happen to think that if this company is prepared to put in those types of commitments then we should be prepared to help it. I am not seeing a great deal of help around at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 10 years or so we have lost a lot of our small and medium manufacturing businesses in this country. Some of these have been lost through natural attrition, but many of them have been lost because of the program of acquiring businesses developed by some of our entrepreneurs. Such acquisitions provide few benefits for the manufacturing industry. Instead, they provide dollars for the businessmen who pick up the businesses at written down book value, use the tax losses, sell off the written down plant and equipment, centralise the administration putting many workers on the scrap heap, and displace many tradesmen who find work in other industries and are lost to the rebuilding of the manufacturing industry process forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not know who you want to blame. Is it the entrepreneur who bought the business and has taken the pickings? Is it the businessman who sold his business? Is it the financier who provided the foreign funds at low interest? Is it the Government which did little? I do not know the answer, but I do know that this exercise has substantially cost the manufacturing industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring this matter to the attention of honourable members because I see a new problem arising. Many Australian companies which sell an interest to foreigners are eventually becoming sales outlets for them rather than continuing in the manufacturing sector. This results in more imports, more tradesmen out of the industry and, naturally, a worsening balance of payments. While I am not supportive of restricting the operations of businesses, it is a problem which we must address to ensure that a viable manufacturing industry continues. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that I have always had a hands on approach, and I will stand up and be counted for manufacturing industry in the electorate of Isaacs. These manufacturers form a very important part of this community, a part which we desperately need in this country's rebuilding process. I would be happy to take honourable members around the industrial base of my electorate-the Moorabbin industrial estate and the Braeside industrial area-for them to see the effect of this Government's policies. Many have gone, and many more of these businesses are simply becoming warehouses for imported goods as the task of manufacturing becomes too difficult for many. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to count the number of manufacturing businesses that have survived. I ask of those who talk of the level playing field and those who will implement the tariff reforms to take into account the effects of the raw material prices, the effects of intervention in our currency value on repeat orders for exporters, the effective lead times for materials compared with that which is offered overseas and the high interest rates which are being paid on stock and work in progress. I have not even considered work practices, transport costs or the cost of Government intervention which is regularly spoken of and which also needs attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not opposed to the removal of tariffs, but I want to make sure that the economic purists take into account the pitfalls. I want to make sure that manufacturing industry in my electorate is not faced with a level playing field that has lush green grass at one end and is a mud patch at the other. I want to make sure that we get it right, because if we do not, our balance of trade suffers; our tax collections through viable, profitable businesses suffer; and our employment suffers, creating additional pressure on our welfare services. If we are to stop the continual cuts in expenditure and maintain a truly Australian lifestyle where people are able to own their own houses, run their own businesses and live in a way that we would wish for our children, then we need to address the problems and we need to address them now. We must address them as Australians, not as a number in a game of political ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> Thinking back to the words used by the honourable member for Isaacs in his maiden speech some 20 years ago, I just hope that a future honourable member for Isaacs in some 20 years or so from now does not have to stand in this House and quote as being relevant then extracts from my maiden speech, in the same way as I have quoted today from Mr David Hamer's speech of March 1970. I will not rest until I see this Government take an interest in those Australians in whom we must take an interest if this country is to prosper once again. They are the Australians who show initiative, those who are prepared to work hard in the development of the country, those who are prepared to work hard in businesses, and those who are prepared to work hard to achieve the Australian dream. Unless we are prepared to offer incentives to those who can return this country to prosperity, then I am afraid that we will continue to see funding cuts in this country, our standard of living will continue to decline, and my words and the words of a past member for Isaacs will echo in this chamber for a long time to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by congratulating the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) and those other members who have made their maiden speeches in the House today. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bills for this year. In the process I shall make some remarks about the importance of the 1990-91 Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I say that this is a Budget of fairness and responsibility. The 1990 Budget maintains the Hawke Government's commitment to ordinary Australians and honours its social justice policy platform. At the same time it is a Budget which maintains the Labor Government's drive to build a better Australia. The election in March heralded the beginning of a new decade. The 1990s will bring with them the culmination of the Hawke Government's attempt to internationalise the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The pre-Hawke years were dark ones indeed. Now the Australian economy can rightly be seen to be a leader on the world stage and we can have a sense of pride, knowing that the reforms which have been created are leading to a more equitable society for all Australians. In the period since the election in March our Government has built on its past achievements. The Hawke Government has courageously addressed the macro-economic and micro-economic reform issues that confront our nation, with decisive policies. They are policies aimed at redressing the economic damage that was done by the economic indolence of the Fraser years. At the same time our policies are addressing the plight of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Our record speaks for itself. The Hawke Government has been courageous in taking steps to address our key economic difficulties, and in doing so has displayed its commitment and its determination to achieve long-term reform. The Hawke Government in the 1983 election campaign emphasised its commitment to fiscal responsibility. It gives me great pleasure to be speaking to Budget initiatives which still emphasise that commitment to responsibility and restraint seven years later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget surplus for this year of $8.107 billion is a considerable achievement. It is larger than last year's surplus and has been brought about with outlays and revenue falling to gross domestic product. The importance of the Budget surplus cannot be underestimated. The Budget surplus is evidence that the Government has been able to manage its books and that the essential services of government are being provided without being an undue burden on our overseas financial resources and, more important, on the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The harmony between service and surplus is the fundamental ingredient enabling our nation to maintain an international financial reputation compatible with other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, and that credit rating is essential to our objective of internationalising the Australian economy. The Hawke Government once again has proven that, unlike the other side of the chamber, it can manage its books and can get the results it promises. The net public sector borrowing requirement will be zero once again this year, the Commonwealth Budget surplus offsetting the combined borrowings of all Commonwealth, State and local authorities. This means the total Commonwealth debt as a share of the economy will be cut further, making it only one-third of what it was five years ago. The Government will not stop there. The remainder of that debt will further decrease when we experience the flow-ons of our comprehensive micro-economic reform strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government came to office in 1983 the fiscal challenge facing it was enormous. The Labor Government did not back away from that challenge and has now produced three consecutive Budget surpluses, which testify to the economic credentials of the Hawke Labor Government. Of course, that does not complete the picture. I propose to highlight a number of key Budget issues in the remainder of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget fulfils the promise of the Australian Labor Party as outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in our policy speech, and really does herald a substantive down payment on Labor's social justice strategy. It is a Budget that reflects Labor's traditional values and commitment to the needy. In this Budget key expenditure outlays and policy initiatives are being delivered whilst maintaining responsible budgetary parameters. Examples of priority expenditure targeting include an increase of 14 per cent or 7.3 per cent in real terms on the combined education portfolios. Not only is that expenditure a recognition by the Labor Party of the importance of educating young Australians, but also the realisation that education is the key to improving the quality and competitiveness of the work force in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Tangible benefits of the increased expenditure in education include extra places in tertiary institutions and a massive commitment to Aboriginal education, as well as better resourced schools. As indicated in my maiden speech in this chamber, I believe educational opportunity is a vital ticket for young people to be able to get on. That is particularly true in electorates like Parramatta. The demographics in my electorate quite plainly indicate that most of the young people will not be going into the family business, nor do they have the advantage of the old school tie. Publicly funded education is the only ticket they have that will enable them to get a fair go in life. The lamentable education record of Liberal Party policies in regions such as mine stands in stark contrast to our Government's positive achievements. We have more than doubled school retention rates since we have been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget will provide further scope for us to consolidate the positive start that we have made in the development of the University of Western Sydney. The range of training programs being developed by the government agencies are also worthy of comment. This Budget gives real help in areas such as migrant education and training, which is important to many people in my electorate, as it is in the many urban electorates of my colleagues. A further example of this Government's real social justice credentials can be witnessed in our policies for the aged. No government in our nation's history has come close to our achievement of developing such a comprehensive retirement incomes policy. Further, we have exceeded our own promise of ensuring that pensions would be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. This year they will be considerably above that figure. At the same time pensioners are progressively being freed from the tax system, one example of this being their immunity from provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Budget I have spoken with many pensioners in my electorate and sought their opinions on the changes to the pensioner benefits scheme and the provisions for deeming of pensioner savings. Very few people have registered complaints. That is because they know that most will not be affected adversely by these changes. The Labor Party has shown great sensitivity for the aged by shifting the emphasis away from nursing home care and towards other residential care. The elderly are more comfortable in environments that they know, and in many cases that they establish themselves. The Hawke Government has done much to enhance the dignity of the aged by providing for them to be cared for at home or in quality hostel environments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policies in this area are providing meaningful help to the aged in my electorate. An example of this is the new home and community care program in the Parramatta area which will be expanded by this Budget, together with special attention being given to meeting the needs of those with dementia. </PARA>

Rallies and other activities were organised around Australia, particularly in the dozens of areas where the timber industry plays an important part in the local economy. These activities have flowed through to Canberra this week as some of the people who depend on the industry for their livelihood come to the national capital to make sure that their views are known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great forest debate has now been going on for many years. Elements of the conservation movement demand that one area after another be locked up, preventing the continuing harvesting of timber. These people come up with the same `last forest' arguments everywhere they travel, and surely everyone now knows that they will not be satisfied until Australia's great timber industry is eliminated entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate contains significant native hardwood timber reserves, including Fraser Island. Over recent months, a small radical group has been trying to prevent logging on Fraser Island. Many of these people are professional protesters who have moved to sunny Queensland for the winter from their usual southern protest venues. This radical group has been disowned by all of the mainline conservation organisations but it still obtains media exposure way beyond its worth. </PARA>
<PARA> The local Forest Protection Society organised successful rallies in Maryborough and Hervey Bay last Friday to demonstrate community support for the timber industry. They were attended and supported by local mayors, civic and business leaders and State and Federal members of parliament-Labor, Liberal and National-all declaring their support for the timber workers of the region. Let the Government have no doubt, the timber industry has widespread support from those who know it and see it in action. </PARA>
<PARA> The timber industry is vital to the economies of cities such as Maryborough and Hervey Bay, both of which already have double the national average unemployment. The local communities are concerned that if the campaigners succeed in locking up areas like Fraser Island, many timber industry jobs will be lost. I share their concern about the effects on the local incomes and economies of their cities. I share their concern about the loss of a vital, valuable and irreplaceable industry in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Nationally, I am concerned about the impact of the loss of our forest industries on our already disgraceful balance of payments situation. Even now, Australia imports $1.8 billion more in timber products than it exports. There is $7 billion of timber industry investment awaiting a firm guarantee from the Government of the continuing availability of timber reserves. This kind of industrial investment is essential for our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this alone would be enough to justify universal support for the timber industry. But I am a committed conservationist. I believe that in using and occupying this earth we have a responsibility to protect and care for it. It is, therefore, particularly because of my commitment to conservation that I am happy to declare my support for the timber industry. Properly managed forests are the only permanent and renewable source of building material, paper and many other products. Forests thrive without polluting factories, deep mining scars, depleting resources or belching chimneys. Timber is indeed environmentally friendly, energy efficient and totally renewable. It contributes positively to the environment while it actually renews. </PARA>
<PARA> Properly managed forestry prevents soil and other environmental degradation. The environmental record of managed forests is far superior to that of almost any other habitat. Trees are living things; they grow and die and they cannot be preserved forever. Those people who live in cities and on cleared allotments cannot point the finger of blame at Australia's forest industries, which they have rarely seen and do not understand. Growing trees slow the greenhouse effect, taking carbon dioxide out of the air and replacing it with oxygen. Young actively growing forests are the lungs of the earth. Older trees produce as much carbon as they absorb when they start to decay. The Australian timber industry establishes at least 150 million new trees every year-an effort that dwarfs the actual achievements of the Federal Government's billion trees program. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraser Island has been logged since 1869 and has been a managed timber resource since 1913. The annual allocation of timber for removal is less than the natural regrowth, allowing timber production in perpetuity. The timber industry is pro-environment. Its own sustainability depends upon it. I, like all other sensible conservationists, am pro-timber industry. It is good for Australia in the short term, in the long term, and in perpetuity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Last Friday I was sitting in my office at about 4 p.m. It had been a long and difficult week. My secretary came in and said that there was a farming couple who would like to see me. I said that I would like to see them too, and we sat down together. This family had, under this Government, obviously paid a fairly significant price. This couple had had kids, and they had had eight of them. They were a normal Australian farming family. They drove a Kingswood, the kids cut wood around the house and everyone chipped in with the washing up. The kids were at school and they were normally dressed-they were a normal farming family. But this particular family, as a result of what this Government is going to do with the assets test, is quite unlikely to remain a viable family. I think that the matters that have been initiated by this Government in relation to the family allowance supplement (FAS) and the family allowance are an absolute disgrace. It is absolutely ludicrous for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to say to a farming family with assets of $300,000 that those assets will generate $57,000-odd. It simply will not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rural community has taken the bit between its teeth on matters such as Iraq. It has also taken the bit between its teeth on matters such as high inflation, reduced markets and reduced commodity prices. But, quite frankly, it has had a gutful of being kicked. The rural community is, indeed, the nerve end of this country. It is made up of small farming families who have been working the land for generation after generation. They are not driving around in a Mercedes-Benz or Rolls Royce; they are simply working that land, working to maintain their children and, hopefully, at least two or three of those children will take the farm over in due course. This policy is going to have a disastrous impact on those farming families. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Treasurer and the Government to rethink this matter-$300,000 is an absolute pittance asset-wise. The realities are that even if people wanted to, they quite simply could not sell these farms-they are not saleable items. Indeed, if they wanted to sell them they would probably have to do so for half of what the farms are worth and they would then be financially destitute for the rest of their lives-that would be their only potential income in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). He sums it up very well when he says that the perpetual dilemma facing Australia's primary producers is the reality of being asset rich but income poor, and just as the fall in commodity prices and the conflict in Iraq is exacerbating this poverty, the Treasurer uses the 1990 Budget to aggravate rural poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> But it goes further than that. We have interference with the assets test in relation to FAS and interference in relation to Austudy. I am quite prepared to concede that there are some people who have abused the situation, but does the Government then cut out the nuts and bolts of the farming community and say, `Some should not be getting it; the bulk of you should be, but everyone goes'? I think it is grossly unfair and, again, I urge this Government to review this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are potentially heading for another rural revolt. It does not give me any joy to see hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of logging trucks tied up at the front of this House. I walked out there the other day, sat on the grass and had a piece of cake and a cup of coffee with a couple of families. They want to do exactly the same thing as the farming family; that is, get on with life, raise their families and put their families in a situation where they can enjoy a piece of cake and live normal lives. But, again, this Government wants to take them on. </PARA>
<PARA> It wants to do it also with the small farming community. The Government quite simply has to wake up to itself. I have said it time and time again: it is Sydney and Melbourne and be damned with the rest. I rather suspect that the rest are sick and tired of being treated like that. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government thinks the logging dispute is going to interfere with things, it may well have a rude shock coming with the number of rural farming families that will be on the lawns out the front of Parliament House. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will not be able to see that freshly fertilised grass because those farming families will be out there in their hundreds and thousands. I beg the Government to review this totally iniquitous assets test.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Government tabled in Parliament the report of the Australian delegation to the Forty-fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Due to the late notice in the procedures of Parliament, I did not have the opportunity then to comment on this report and I wish to do so now very briefly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Dick Klugman, the former member for Prospect, and I had the opportunity to be delegates to the Forty-fourth Session of the General Assembly with full responsibility to participate in committees, debates and the decision-making processes on United Nations agenda items. We both thank Parliament for this opportunity and experience and particularly express our gratitude to Ambassador Wilenski and to all members of the Australian delegation for their help and courtesy. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations General Assembly corresponded to a period of rapid and extreme change in Eastern Europe. The people of Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria at that time repudiated their former communist governments and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) itself changed its approach and attitude to the United States of America and her allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of confrontation, the USSR's main activities appeared to be an appeal for Western economic assistance. Such radical changes will undoubtedly bring significant changes to the future patterns of the United Nations activities as traditional voting patterns realign and the USSR comes into competition with developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be now no major ideological conflict between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact countries. There were many instances when the USSR acted as a pro-Western pressure group in an attempt to avoid conflict developed on items relating to the Middle East, Africa and Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> We, as parliamentary advisers, foresaw that future discussions at the United Nations will be less ideological as concern moves towards the issue of future economic development versus environmental factors. The future of the global environment, of course, captured the imagination of the Forty-fourth Assembly. Few world leaders neglected to speak at length on this issue during their opportunity to address this world forum. Skill will undoubtedly be required to develop sensitive mechanisms to strike a middle course of action to satisfy the aspirations of developed and developing countries as this rapidly becomes a multinational issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We do, however, note areas of general concern with the operations of the United Nations. The tireless efforts to reach consensus, we believe, run the risk of losing impact and ultimately the effectiveness of resolutions. The ineffective chairmanship of some United Nations committee meetings and an inability to adhere to scheduled agenda items and times waste valuable human and economic resources. The range of agenda items should be limited in scope and diversity to concentrate on issues of major international significance. </PARA>
<PARA> Debate in the United Nations on alleged breaches of human rights predominantly, unfortunately, concentrates on smaller countries and, in some instances, on minor infringements by relatively good performers while passing over many obvious breaches. With some notable exceptions from some countries, debate on China at the Forty-fourth Assembly was a glaring example. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest achievement for the UN during 1989-possibly since its inception-was the peaceful transition through democratic elections to an independent Namibia. A more pragmatic approach was adopted to the horrendous problems of world debt and this was evident with the nations recognising and being urged to come to grips with their own domestic economies and reform before an expectation of a UN response. It is no longer acceptable to assume that the best option for debt is to renege on repayment. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was very much involved in debate about the deleterious effects of driftnet fishing. We called as a mission for an immediate ban to these non-sustainable fishing practices, and there has already been positive action, particularly from Japan. The Forty-fourth General Assembly also debated unprecedented attention to the drug problems which reflect alarm over the rapidly worsening impact of drugs and the drug trade on health, law and order, economic and political systems and even to levels of peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA> During the period of the Assembly, officials and personnel appeared to bear an excessive workload and we believe this should be rectified. As mission resources are limited, this could be achieved by a better establishment of priorities and references from Canberra. We believe the Australian delegation met most of its principle objectives and fully utilised the option the UN provides to us as a middlesized power to directly exploit events on which we have little unilateral influence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -One of the essential constituent parts of Labor mythology over the years has been the need for an opponent. Labor mythology thrives on opposition. It is what gives the motivation for those who hold very disparate views on particular issues to band together, whether it be opposition to employers, faceless capitalism, finance capital or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of Labor being in government in both State and Federal parliaments over a long part of the last decade, the view that Labor and Labor members represent the downcast and the downtrodden has taken something of a beating. It is very hard to believe that Labor members represent the downcast and the downtrodden, as Labor members speed around Canberra in Commonwealth cars and as friends and acquaintances are appointed to Reserve Bank and Qantas boards and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I could not help but notice this afternoon as maiden speeches were being given that a new opponent has been discovered that gives impetus and motivation to modern Labor thinking, at least among some of the newer members. I refer, of course, to the entrepreneur of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> The entrepreneur of the 1980s came in for sustained attack during this afternoon and tonight, and with good cause. There has been in my view-I have said it before and I say it again-some very bad corporate practice in Australia over the past 10 years. As the results of that became apparent, we realised that the economy had suffered in material respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor backbenchers ought to ask themselves who was in government when the practices that they are now so roundly condemning were occurring. Who was responsible for the administration of corporate law and corporate regulation? Who was it that was supposed to be ensuring that the laws were enforced? It was the Labor parties, both State and Federal, that presided over a system which allowed to occur what is now being so roundly condemned, and they ought to go back through the pages of the business magazines and see which leaders in particular were feting those that they so roundly condemn now. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an interesting event during Question Time today when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was asked about a speech he gave in memory of the late Ben Chifley and the vision of the light on the hill. The Prime Minister did not effectively and specifically come around to answering the question but nobody could be left in any doubt that, as far as the Prime Minister is concerned, Ben Chifley's light on the hill has been extinguished. As far as he is concerned, those principles that he once stood for, which the Prime Minister himself once supported-public ownership of banks and airlines-in the light of modern conditions can be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA> Those that are on the Labor back bench and still nurturing that vision of the light on the hill ought to realise that their leader, the Prime Minister, has effectively extinguished that vision and they must either fall in line with him or forgo that nurtured, dearly held, cherished mythology that sustains them in so many ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, if you were to walk around this building, you would see on some of the walls and on some of the doors of the Labor back bench members cartoons and posters protesting about the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. One in particular describes it as `30 pieces of silver' but I say to those members of the Labor back bench: `If you really feel strongly about that kind of issue, don't just put posters up in your windows. Don't just get up here in Parliament and talk about outmoded concepts of lights on the hill, which have been done away with by your own leader. Think very carefully about your actions'. </PARA>
<PARA> The light on the hill has disappeared as far as the Labor leadership is concerned. That mythology has been done away with. If honourable members opposite still believe in it they have a responsibility to make that clear, not only to the leadership of the Party in the private forums of the Party but also in this Parliament, to those whom they represent. Honourable members should think carefully before they follow the Prime Minister in doing away with what is obviously so dear to their hearts. If it be not dear to their hearts they should at least have the intellectual honesty to acknowledge that, to do away with that mythology and come to the realisation it is outmoded and useless in the modern economic climate of Australia today. </PARA>

<TITLE>Imported Pig Meat</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Wide Bay)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.50)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Recently the Government announced that it will be allowing the import of uncooked Canadian pig meat. In making the announcement as Acting Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) ignored industry advice and disregarded the wishes of Australian pig producers who are emphatically opposed to the import of Canadian pig meat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pig industry's objections to imports are based on two factors: firstly, the risk of entry of disease into this country; secondly, the fact that the Canadian industry is heavily subsidised. The pig disease transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is not known in Australia. The disease is able to cause up to 90 per cent mortality in young pigs and would be disastrous to the local industry. However, the disease is endemic throughout the northern hemisphere, including Canada. A great deal of scientific research has been devoted to determining what level of risk is associated with allowing uncooked Canadian pork meat into Australia. All of the researchers agree that it is technically possible for TGE to be introduced by importing Canadian pork. </PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that the risk is small. The Government's advisers put the risk factor at one in three million. However, a separate study by the Australian Veterinary Association has put the risk factor at one in 15,000. With the prospect of 270,000 pig carcases being imported into Australia in a year as a result of the Government's decision, a risk factor of one in 15,000 is clearly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has few natural competitive advantages on the international export market. Our infrastructure costs, transport and waterfront inefficiencies, and heavy levels of government taxation all make it difficult for Australian industry to trade internationally. One of the few advantages that our isolation provides for us is the fact that there are many diseases and pests worldwide which have not yet found their way into this country. That advantage should not carelessly be thrown away. </PARA>
<PARA> Any risk is too much risk. Whether the mathematical calculation is one in 15,000 or some other figure, the risk to the Australian pig industry of importing Canadian meat should not be entertained. Around 10 per cent of our balance of payment deficit is attributable to food imports. In a wonderfully productive country like Australia, which is capable of producing all of its own feed needs and plenty for others, we import food products from other nations. Much of the food that is now being imported does not reach the same strict health standards as are required for food producers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Chemicals banned in Australia are often used on the food products imported into this land. These double standards not only discriminate against Australian farmers and food producers, but also put Australian consumers at risk. In relation to the pig industry, the chemical mecadox is one such example. Australian farmers cannot use this chemical but it remains available in Canada. So in addition to the disease risk there is the possibility that Canadian pork imports will contain unacceptable chemical residues. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian pork industry is heavily subsidised. Canadian producers who produce pork have the benefit of over 20 different subsidy programs, mostly government backed. The American Department of Commerce has determined that Canadian pork is subsidised to the extent of 8.5c a kilo and has imposed a countervailing duty on all imported Canadian pig meat. The Canadian tripartite support program, contributed to by Federal and provincial governments in Canada as well as pork producers, results in benefits of between $37 and $41 per pig. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is well aware of the Government subsidies that Canadian producers are receiving and yet will take no action to prevent these subsidised imports being dumped in Australia. Australian producers have to rely on completely ineffective anti-dumping provisions to obtain any kind of redress. Pig consumption is seasonal. Everyone wants a Christmas ham, so waiting 295 days before the imposition of any kind of countervailing duty is completely ineffective. The damage to the Australian industry would already be done before any countervailing measure would be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadians have not responded positively to Australia's initiative in opening up our markets for their unwanted pig products. They have already shown their gratitude by giving preference to United States canned fruit, denying Australia one of its most important markets. We get no thanks from the rest of the world for exposing our marketplace to unfair competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In his 1989 Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that the 1989 Budget would bring home the bacon. Of course, the Budget proved to be a disaster for Australians. But the question remains: If the Treasurer does bring home the bacon, will it come from Canadian pigs?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following in the vein of my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), I too listened with interest to some of the maiden speeches that were made by members from the back bench of the Government. I notice that when things start to go wrong members of the Australian Labor Party, like the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), seem to adopt a fairly simple formula. First, they try somehow to keep talking about the past. The fact that the previous Liberal-National Government lost in 1983-over seven years ago now-seems to be conveniently overlooked. We are now seeing contorted figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite talk about the number of years Labor has been in power versus the number of years the coalition was in power and somehow, using some very tenuous arguments, suggest that problems that have occurred mostly in the last seven years were somehow not really the fault of the government of the day, but of the government of 10, 20, or, in some cases, it seems, almost 30 years ago. I think that logic ought to be dispelled and shown up for what it is. It is contorted; it is an abuse of the facts. Of course, many of the problems that we see today are fairly and squarely the problems that have been caused by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the economic field, of course, we have had the same Treasurer (Mr Keating) for those seven years and no-one else but he can accept the blame for what has occurred. I notice also that Labor members often try to distort the facts and nowhere so obviously than with the myth that is continually repeated by some members of the Government about the so-called deficit that the Labor Party inherited. If we took a cursory look at the facts we would see that it is a myth. It is a distortion and honourable members who aspire to represent their electorates and their country ought to lift their game a bit on it. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a change in government in March 1983. The Budget of 1982, of course, referred to the 1982-83 financial year, which ended on 30 June 1983. That is a matter of over three months after the Hawke Government was elected and yet we continue to hear references to things like inherited deficits of $9.6 billion which, of course, is highly misleading. I would probably prefer to use an unparliamentary term, but I guess I should not. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the facts, we see that the 1982-83 Budget had a deficit of $4.3 billion, less than half the figure that some honourable members from the Government side, including some of the newer members of this chamber, continue to talk about. How honourable members can continue to use a twisted bit of logic to do that leaves me curious because, frankly, it is less than honest. I think that honourable members should be reminded of the simple fact that the 1982-83 Budget ran out on 30 June 1983, three months after the Hawke Government was elected and the deficit was $4.3 billion, not the other figure that is often used. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that so many speeches coming from the other side continue to use the old Labor rhetoric of exaggerating the achievements of the Government. Again I think that should be exposed for what it is, nothing more than exaggeration. The combination of these two factors-both the blaming of the past efforts of governments 10, 20 or 30 years ago and the exaggeration of the present achievements of this Government-indicates that this Government is more than overdue for retirement into the fields on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
