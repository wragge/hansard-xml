<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the Australian Labor Party conference on privatisation which will be held next Monday. Does this conference have the power to veto Government policy on privatisation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1931" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question implies that the Government is about developing a policy on privatisation per se. It is not. It never has been. It is about deciding on a policy where assets, now exclusively in the public sector, can be best used in terms of their value to the community generally and in terms of their efficiency. It is on that basis that the Government has undertaken to consider each of the various public authorities, and their business, which have been under public notice in the last six to 12 months or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Party has a process and it has a policy. I have said before in this House and I will say it again: the Australian Labor Party is the only real political party in Australia. It functions like a political party. What we have on the other side of the House is outfits bound together by convenience rather than conviction, outfits which do not function as a living, breathing organ of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party is a mass party; it has feelings; it has views; and it has very deeply-rooted sentiments about certain areas of policy. The Opposition never had such depth and sentiments. The Liberal Party will always be just an outfit. Because it does not have those processes, it does not have conferences which mean anything. That is why the Labor Party is always so newsworthy organisationally, and it remains newsworthy in or out of office because it is the one great mass party of Australia and it is the one party which has been the only vehicle of social and economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA> What honourable members opposite regard as a bit of value for themselves as spectators on the sidelines of the policy ferment that goes on from time to time in my Party, in the end, of course, leads to policy action, the implementation of which generally beats the Opposition members. We will go on beating them because we are the only party which can actually deal with problems. Honourable members opposite say they can deal with them but they never get around to it. They were always going to reduce tariffs but they never did it. They were always going to privatise things but they never got around to it. They were going to float the Australian dollar but they could not do that. They were going to turn Australia into a market economy but they never got around to it.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that what that crowd says and what it has ever done are two distinctly different things. As usual, it will be this Party which breaks all the new ground in Australian social and economic life. So they want to watch our conference because what will come out of it will be more progress for Australia. They can just sit on the sidelines again and watch the real Government of Australia get on with it.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1932" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the honourable member for Adelaide, and through him the House, that a report on year 12 assessment was recently completed by the Australasian Conference of Assessment and Certification Authorities at the request of the Australian Education Council. That report will be released today for public comment. The report is telling us about the kinds of certificates that are issued for people who are leaving school at the end of year 12. The report maps the differences which exist across State and territory boundaries. I hope that upon the release of the report we will be able to see an active debate about these issues and about which of the differences between the States and the territories are really justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The terminology in the States and the Territories varies considerably. The courses which students study vary. The arrangements for assessing and reporting students' achievements vary, and the marks and grades given for tertiary entrance subjects also vary. In the area of assessment, in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory subjects for tertiary entrance are assessed by a combination of external exams and moderated, school-based assessment, while in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory these subjects are assessed by school-based assessments alone. Of course, the process of school-based assessments or the process of moderation varies from place to place as well.</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of tertiary entrance, we find that the scale used in the States varies enormously, as does the aggregates which are provided to determine tertiary entrance. For instance, in New South Wales the score is calculated out of 500, whilst in Queensland it is calculated out of 990. So, just to give you a comparison, Mr Speaker, a student in various States who reached the same level of achievement in, for instance, English would receive an A in Victoria and the ACT, 84 in New South Wales and Western Australia, 18 in South Australia and the Northern Territory, and a C in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, if we look across the whole range of different assessment practices, we see that it is only in South Australia and the Northern Territory, which are formally linked, that there is the same process. In other words, in no two States besides South Australia and the Northern Territory are there identical systems for assessing year 12 achievement and, therefore, entry into the university system. This obviously creates difficulties for students moving from one State to another, having passed year 12 in one State and attempting to get entry into a university in another State. It also seems to me that it places students at a disadvantage if there is not a process of uniform recognition across the country in terms of year 12 achievement.</PARA>
<PARA> I intend that this matter will be on the agenda of the next meeting of the Australian Education Council and I hope that through the discussions there and elsewhere we can advance this issue with a view to achieving a greater sense of uniformity and consistency across the country. Of course, this occurs at a time when there is a debate, which the Prime Minister has encouraged, about trying to re-examine the functions of the State and Commonwealth governments in relation to our various responsibilities. I hope that no-one will allow this debate to derail a quite proper move in the direction of achieving greater consistency and uniformity in some standard measures like year 12 assessment procedures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Treasurer advise the House in what manner the present economic policy settings are intended to reduce Australia's current account deficit and the consequent build-up in our external indebtedness?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1933" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the Government came to office it has tried to repair very quickly the policy framework left to us by our predecessors to bring a trend change in the current account deficit and inflation and to lift growth in employment, a policy which it undertook from its inception. One of the principal changes, of course, in that has been the very dramatic shift in the public sector balance from a strong deficit to a surplus on the Commonwealth's Budget. That has been perhaps the principal block upon which the change in the savings balance has been built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No such change has been evident in the policy of the Opposition. At this stage, seven years on, the Opposition has not constructed a credible policy framework in its responses. Even though this Parliament is now six months old, there is no coordinated framework of policies to deal with the current account imbalance, inflation and some of the other problems endemic to the economy. The Opposition has three policies: privatisation, the consumption tax and a reduction in tariffs to zero. That is the totality of the policy response.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked a number of questions about privatisation. There is no current account panacea from privatisation. If the Opposition as a government succeeded in selling Telecom Australia for $20 billion, apart from the problems that would bring in terms of the domestic economy it would make not a jot of difference to the current account balance in terms of the savings-investment balance and the call on overseas savings. It would simply be a transfer to the Budget, drawing down a call upon Australian savings. If that is not what it means, and the Opposition is saying it thinks that foreign equity ought to be involved, which would see capital inflow onto the current account, that foreign equity would be involved only if the sovereignty we currently enjoy over telecommunications-or any other area, for that matter-were diminished. At any rate, nobody would handle a $20 billion foreign exchange exposure. So that would make no difference to the current account.</PARA>
<PARA> That is the principal point. Privatisation may improve the efficiency of a business and it may mean a more rational allocation of national resources but it will not make any difference to the current account deficit. Any policy built upon that premise is wrong and cannot make a contribution to the principal problem facing the economy. The consumption tax which we have heard so much about adds seven percentage points to the price level and to inflation. A 15 per cent consumption tax net of the wholesale sales tax lifts that inflation rate by seven percentage points. The Leader of the Opposition made a pathetic comment when he said that a change in the price level is not a change in inflation-that is, seven percentage points of price level just disappear from the inflation rate. Presumably it comes out of wages, but there is no way the Opposition would then have a wages policy in place to secure the discounts.</PARA>
<PARA> So the consumption tax will not change the savings balance because it cannot reduce marginal rates of tax. A consumption tax will only run down the Budget surplus and cannot change marginal rates of tax; therefore it cannot change the performance on savings but adds seven percentage points to inflation. As a panacea, that will do nothing to deal with the current account or competitiveness and will just make the place less competitive as seven percentage points of prices get built into inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister has an objective of a zero tariff level by the year 2000, as I understand it. This comes from a member of a party which not only has never reduced tariffs but has always increased protection. The average level of protection increased during the seven years of the Fraser Government. This Labor Government has reduced protection levels. But we make decisions about whether we want industries. For instance, we want a car industry. We know that a car industry will not function at zero protection levels, but apparently those opposite believe that at a zero level of protection a car industry will remain viable. It will not. The Opposition is really saying it does not want a car industry.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition wants to make those choices it has to think about how these tariff levels will impact on particular industries. That is why the Government's 33 per cent reduction in tariffs, phased down, gave industries a chance to adjust and why the car plan and the textiles, clothing and footwear plans have dealt with particular pockets of very high protection-which was, of course, introduced in the first place by those opposite. The Opposition's tariff policy will not do anything to rapidly improve the competitiveness of the economy; it will wipe some industries right out.</PARA>
<PARA> The totality of the Opposition's policy in this Parliament includes privatisation, which will do nothing for the current account, a consumption tax which will blow the inflation rate to pieces, and a tariff level which is a bit of ideology from a party which has never had the courage to reduce protection in the first place. In fact, it introduced the protection levels we now have. In other words, six months on and the Opposition has no policy structure to deal with two principal problems-the current account deficit and inflation. It has no wages policy and the business community is already crying for relief from the so-called anti-inflation strategy. It is now worrying about wage flexibility as it does not like enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA> Here we are six months on and the Opposition still has no economic policy-no policy on the current account and inflation and what passes as a policy on privatisation. Yet members of the Opposition come here and ask questions of the Government as though there were some virtue in their position. Their position would do nothing about the current account deficit and would make inflation worse.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand by the remarks I made whenever I am quoted as making them. That is not to say that there is no room for a supply policy. That supply policy has always recognised the fact that in the last few years in particular the market has been grossly oversupplied and prices have been falling. The Labor Party has had what has now been described as a three mines policy, restricting mining to Ranger, Nabarlek and Roxby Downs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members may well know, there is a uranium review committee currently reviewing all aspects of the Labor Party's uranium policy. Whether any aspects of the policy should change will be a matter for the Government after that review has been completed. Then and only then will the Government decide the future of that policy. The fact is that at the moment the market is grossly oversupplied. There are large inventories continuing to overhang the market. The Labor Party is exercising due prudence in its policy which stems from both market and environmental considerations. We will continue to exercise that due prudence after our own Party committee decides what it believes the future uranium policy should be.</PARA>

All members of this House will acknowledge the special importance of communications between our defence forces in the Persian Gulf and their families back home in Australia. I therefore note with concern references in the weekend press that mail sent from Australia to the Gulf force ships has been tampered with. Parcels have been opened and some, obviously including video and audio tapes, have been found empty.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this question from the honourable member for Port Adelaide because it gives me an oppor- tunity to elaborate on the range of support activities which are being undertaken to assist the families of the crews currently in the Gulf. The Maritime Commander, the Command Services Personnel Office in Sydney, the commander of each ship and I personally have each written to the families of the personnel involved in the task force, conveying to them the range of support which is available to the families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also sent them a copy of the three speeches made by the leaders of the three major parties in this place, setting out the reasons for the deployment and conveying their support and the support of the overwhelming majority of Australians for the job our task force is doing there.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, the Command Services Office in Sydney is producing a fortnightly newsletter for issue to all the next of kin to keep them informed of the latest developments and social gatherings of the families are being organised. Also a 008 number has been established in Sydney to help with any queries and requests for assistance. All personnel services officers throughout Australia are in touch with the next of kin by telephone or, if that is not possible, by letter, to reinforce the message that help is available as needed.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the honourable member for Port Adelaide raised the matter of getting the mail through. Everybody in the Navy and indeed in Australia would understand the need to keep the mail flowing. As of late last week, a total of 47 mailbags had been dispatched to the task group, the majority of which reached the group though some 18 are still awaiting dispatch. There have been 18 bags dispatched from the task force.</PARA>
<PARA> I too noted with concern the reports that mail for personnel in ships deployed to the Gulf appears to have been tampered with and that parcels which appeared to contain video or audio tapes were opened and the contents missing. I should explain to the House that mail for personnel serving in the ships deployed in the Gulf is bagged and dispatched by the international mail section of Australia Post in Sydney. That is then carried by air to the Middle East by commercial means for forwarding to the Royal Australian Navy's task force. It is subject to customs clearance in those Middle East countries through which it must pass.</PARA>
<PARA> The House needs to understand that those countries have very strict regulations, particularly as regards the importation of pornographic material. As a consequence, some parcels in the mail dispatched to the ships from Australia appear to have been opened for inspection. As a result of that, the Navy is currently investigating other options for the delivery of mail to personnel and it is hoped that this will overcome those problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of reports about my comments yesterday, but let me go to the comments that I actually made yesterday rather than what has been read into them by the headlines. First of all, the remarks that I made on the Sunday show yesterday did not suggest in any way that I would not oppose mining in the Kakadu National Park. In fact, the legislation prohibits any mining within the Kakadu National Park. In answer to the first part of the question, about whether I would resign if the Government decided that it would go ahead with the mines, I said that no, I would not. Then I was asked for my personal views in relation to the mines and I said that that was a matter for internal discussion and consideration by the Party. Then I referred to the processes that the Party was currently engaged in. I said that any decision on the development of the new mines will depend on the outcome of the review of the three-mine policy. That is a point that has been made over and over again in this House and it is exactly the point that I made yesterday. So I outlined clearly what my role as Environment Minister should be, which is to ensure that, if there were a change in policy, there was an outline of what the proper environmental considerations would be. That is exactly what I said in my comments yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was quite amazed when I saw the headlines in today's papers. I will take the Parliament through some of them. The first one was from the reliable Australian newspaper, which carried the headline: `Kelly Sees Role as Uranium Watch-Dog'. That is quite a reasonable headline, I would have thought. The Canberra Times says: `Kelly won't pack up over mining'. That is true. I did say that I would not resign over that issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The Melbourne Age gets into more of a frenzy. It says: `Kelly hints at mining in Kakadu'. In the  Australian Financial Review, I had accepted Kakadu mining, but by the time I reached the Sydney Morning Herald, I was actually out there mining myself. The article is headed: `I'd accept mining: Kelly'. It commences by stating that not only would I accept further uranium mining, but that I would accept it happening in World Heritage areas. That is absolute nonsense.</PARA>

In those comments I state quite clearly that the Australian Labor Party is going through its own processes and that decisions will be made by the Cabinet after that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to say that I am aware that many young constituents are getting STONED, as the honourable member for Chifley would describe it. For once, that can be considered to be a very good thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many honourable members may not be fully aware that this phenomenon is occurring in many electorates throughout Australia. Yes, the Commonwealth has been very much involved. The more people in our community get STONED, the better off many of them will be. In this instance, the acronym STONED is the name of a board game that is designed to teach children and young people and their parents about the effects of drug misuse and abuse on their bodies. It means: Stimulants, Tranquillisers, Opiates, Nicotine and Education on Drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the reason why the honourable member for Chifley is so interested and involved in this program is that it was developed and designed at the Mount Druitt Hospital in his electorate. An evaluation of the game has shown that players have increased knowledge about drug and alcohol issues and that positive peer relationships have been established, leading to a healthier and more responsible lifestyle. It is certainly active in creating more lively discussion. It is a shame that honourable members opposite have embarked upon lively discussions while this question is being answered.</PARA>
<PARA> Alcohol abuse in our community is acknowledged by parents and by young people as the No. 1 issue of concern, as well it might be. About 21 per cent of all deaths in the Australian community are as a result of alcohol abuse. The heaviest drinking section of our population are those in the 15 to 34 age group. In fact, in that age group alcohol abuse accounts for 65 per cent of deaths. So, the more information that is put together, through campaigns such as the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, in cooperation and in conjunction with organisations such as the Mount Druitt Hospital in the honourable member's electorate, the better off and more aware we will be as a community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to confirm that nothing the Government will do will wreck any of these authorities. The fact of the matter is that, in the Opposition's manic determination to sell these things, it does not see them as being of intrinsic value. In fact, in the negotiations which some honourable members opposite had with the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association before the last election, I am reliably informed that they made it clear to that group that they wanted to be rid of the Commonwealth Bank at any price. In other words, off and away it goes-not to see what value the Commonwealth Bank had to serve Australia as an institution of worth but to turn it off the books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Presumably the Opposition would have done an underwriting deal. It would have pulled in an underwriter and said, `Place the stock wherever and with whomever it suits you to place it'. It would have been very much on the old mates basis that the stock was placed and the underwriting was done. That is the sort of attitude the Opposition has to public authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a much more constructive attitude on this side of the House. We are about seeing public authorities for both their worth and benefit to the community and how best they can continue to provide an important place and role in the Australian economy. Some of the changes to those authorities which the Government has considered, both now and in the past, look at their performance as authorities as well as their broader value, and my Party will be doing more of that at its conference.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also happy to endorse what the Prime Minister said the other day. One would be foolish to stay simply defending a position when it was obvious to one that such authorities might be advantaged by a change in their configuration, by having more private capital in them, and we are quite happy to defend that. If I could quote to members of the Opposition one of their own: he said that consistency in politics showed the sign of a small mind. That was former Senator Withers, and perhaps honourable members opposite should read a few of his truisms.</PARA>

Has the Privacy Commissioner been contacted concerning the privacy implications of changes to the PBS announced in the Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1939" SPEAKER="Staples The Hon P.R." NAMEID="KJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="JAGAJAGA" MINISTERIAL="AGED, FAMILY AND HEALTH SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the question from the honourable member for Cowan and others who have raised this matter, on Friday and Saturday the Australian newspaper ran a number of what can only be described as sensationalised and misleading allegations concerning the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, prompted, I believe, primarily by Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I issued a press release on this matter on Friday. The Health Insurance Commission also issued a statement. I can assure all members of the House that the Government is not building a single centralised database with open, on-line access by government agencies to one another's information. The Government is taking a series of measures to ensure that this does not happen. I wrote to the Privacy Commissioner on the night of the Budget outlining the Government's intentions, and I am seeking his close involvement with the implementation of the eligibility checking for the PBS. I hope to receive a response to that when he returns from overseas in a few days time.</PARA>
<PARA> If the article in the Australian were accurate and the HIC already had that power, there would be no need to contact the Privacy Commissioner, would there? The reporter, Tracey Aubin, and Senator Boswell suggest that regulations passed by both Houses last year have some kind of unconstrained powers buried in them that have escaped parliamentary scrutiny-powers that enable the HIC to do virtually anything it likes in building computer systems.</PARA>
<PARA> If that were the case, there would be no need to introduce legislative amendment, as the Government intends, because the HIC would already be able to do what it likes. Of course, it is not true, just as any suggestion that there is to be a new Australia Card is patently untrue as well. On Friday, Mr Wilcox, the General Manager of the Health Insurance Commission, said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no truth to the statement that the Commission is ready to call tenders for the computer equipment in a matter of weeks. No action will be taken by the Commission until there is clear legislative approval of the Government's Budget proposals.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at some of the claims and facts. The article in the Australian on Saturday, 15 September referred to regulation 105. I assume the author was referring to section 105 of the National Health Act which has been in force since 1953. Despite claims that the legislation was put through surreptitiously last year, the section that the reporter referred to was put through in 1953. I doubt that the reporter was even born at that time. I was only about 6 years old, and I think Senator Boswell was about 13 years old. So it is a little hard to stretch one's imagination that far. Any new regulations are, of course, subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance motions can be moved, so the 1953 provision can hardly be said to be giving the Department of Community Services and Health, or the Health Insurance Commission as the body which administers the PBS, any unfettered powers.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, parts of the eligibility package simply cannot be dealt with under the existing legislation, and the Government has decided that it wants the entire package included in the National Health Act after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> I make three basic points regarding privacy issues. Privacy issues are legitimately a matter of concern for all Australians, and that is why the Government is involving the Privacy Commissioner in these matters before any changes are made. That is also why discussion on these matters should be treated with accuracy and without scaremongering. I think that the best way to do that is to get the information straight. The author of the articles, Tracey Aubin of the Australian, did not contact my office before writing her first story. I went to her after she wrote it, and we have seen the result of that one. All I say in that regard is: why did she not call? As for Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, he is getting a reputation as a Sunbeam mixmaster-always mixing things up and beating them up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Prime Minister to an article in the Australian Financial Review last week which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Mr Keating's defeat on telecommunications . . . is a relatively minor setback to his overall objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>Does the Acting Prime Minister agree with that carefully briefed assessment? If so, can he explain why he attacked the Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia for suggesting that telecommunications was a distraction from the important macro-economic issues which the Acting Prime Minister is either unable or unwilling to tackle?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1940" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder who wrote this question out for the honourable member? Obviously he was flat out getting the message across the lobes to get that little bit of text down. I do not regard telecommunications as a distraction. Frankly, that comment from the Business Council of Australia, suggesting that that was so, was disgraceful. This is an area of economic activity that already is very important to the Australian economy, and will become more important as the years go by, particularly as information technology more substantially dominates activity in the world economy. This is especially so in an area where Australia has certain natural advantages, such as our position in the Asian-Pacific area and the fact that we are technologically competent in all aspects of telecommunications-technically, in marketing terms and in general strategic terms. Tackling telecommunications reform is an important part of the micro-economic agenda. It is very short-sighted for business to see it otherwise. I do not think business does see it otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason the Business Council of Australia was stung by any comments I or the Minister might have made about it is that it virtually had no position on the matter, by virtue of the fact that Telecom Australia was a member of the Business Council of Australia. I made the point then, and I will make it again, that the business community is always requiring of the Government that it reduce real wages, that it should hold wages down in a period of unprecedented demand, that in an area of the community which is allied to the Labor Party-that is, the trade union movement-we should exact from that sector and from those people concessions that go to their livelihood, their security and their future. Yet the Business Council of Australia could not see its way clear to nominate a position for itself and for business, virtually because it did not want to offend a constituent.</PARA>
<PARA> That does bring into stark relief the impotence of these organisations in dealing with major economic questions. I thought that the Council's absence from this debate had been a very notable one. I refer the honourable gentleman to a piece written by Michael Stutchbury in the Australian Financial Review last week, a very important piece of journalism. He said that the business constituency on inflation has disappeared, that once the heat was on, all the anti-inflation rhetoric dropped away. Now the Business Council of Australia is wandering around the portals of this building seeking further relief from interest rates and monetary policy, while six months ago it was talking about the virtues of an independent central bank.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there is no staying power and no sense of strategy in these bodies. The same can be said about wages, and Michael Stutchbury made a similar telling point about wage flexibility. How much have we heard from business, particularly from the Business Council of Australia, about wage flexibility? Which business buckled first to the wage campaign of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)? It was Mayne Nickless, managed by Mr Webber, the former chairman of the Business Council's wage group, who was identified with the whole question of a new approach to wages and wage flexibility. What did he say? He said: `Well, we are in a cost-plus business. If there is no import competition for transport, and obviously you cannot bring a truck in carrying goods on the water, so we have no international competition and we will charge the domestic economy what the market will bear'. In other words: `There is no need for us to lift our game, improve our performance, lower our costs or resist wage claims.' This is an economy in which there has been a tight monetary policy and slowing economic activity, along with rising unemployment, and yet this industry gave in straight away to the ACTU's wage campaign. Remember that that statement came from the former leadership of the Business Council of Australia on wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA> So this makes a mockery of this whole point about wage flexibility. I have been telling this to the honourable member for Bennelong for years and he is still parroting his stuff. I do not disparage the notion that he is seeking but the only way to get wage flexibility is, basically, by breaking down the craft structure through award restructuring and by getting enterprise flexibility in the way in which the ACTU is trying to get it. Mr Stutchbury was quite correct in making this very salient point about the weakness of the business community in facing up to the whole question of wage flexibility and paying wage increases in a declining economy-not a booming economy where there are labour shortages, but where economic activity is declining.</PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia has proven several things in the last few weeks. Firstly, it is no longer there on anti-inflation strategy the moment the temperature starts to rise; on wage flexibility all that it trafficks in is theory; and its member companies are the first to yield to a campaign in a period of decelerating economic activity. Secondly, it regards telecommunications, an area of major reform in Australia, as a distraction.</PARA>
<PARA> The only thing I would say to my colleagues in the Opposition is that they would be able as a government, if they were to become a government, to rely upon the Business Council of Australia no more than we have been able to rely upon it. As usual, it will be up to the Government to do it all, as it usually is, in the areas of inflation, wages and telecommunications. That is the sad truth of it. There is just not the leadership on the business side in this country that we have seen on the labour side. That has not been a feature in the last 7 1/2 years. The last business leader in this country was the late Sir Keith Campbell who, unfortunately, departed this world within weeks of the Government coming to office. There has not been another business leader since then.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was an earlier question relating to the recognition of qualifications within Australia, particularly within the school system. This question relates to a very important issue for this country-the recognition of skills of people coming to Australia seeking to advance their careers here by utilising particular qualifications. My colleague the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs last week released a report from the Centre for Multicultural Studies which pointed out the lack of success which many overseas-trained migrants had in obtaining suitable employment in Australia. It is a shocking situation where we have people who have skills, often in areas where there are shortages in Australia-indeed, their very selection to come to Australia is related to their skills and the shortages of those skills in Australia-and who find it very difficult, in some cases impossible, to obtain suitable employment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a number of things which need to be done and which are being done. It needs to be said in the first place, however, that once again we have the impediment of the federal system standing in our way. Many of the bodies which are responsible for providing the skill levels or the qualifications in particular professions are State based or, worse, are sometimes controlled by individual professions. Therefore, what the Federal Government can do is, of course, limited by the extent to which it can achieve cooperation with the States.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say, however, that some important steps have been taken with the States to try to ensure that there is reform of the recognition of overseas qualifications. We have also achieved the agreement with the appropriate bodies to move to new competency-based skills standards in a number of professions such as nursing, architecture, engineering, pharmacy, psychology and veterinary science, and there has been a substantial improvement in the information provided to intending settlers to Australia. We have also increased substantially from 180 to 500 the number of bridging places funded by the Commonwealth in order to assist those people who need to upgrade their qualifications for appropriate recognition in Australia to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, last year we established the National Office of Overseas Skills Recognition which has an advisory committee chaired by Sir William Keys. That committee has been very active in examining these issues and making recommendations to us about how these matters should be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to say finally that there are some things that governments can do. There are some things that the professions-sometimes reluctantly-can be required to do. But in the end it also depends on employers taking a more enlightened view about the qualifications of these people who may come from non-English speaking backgrounds and who may have different cultures from those of the employers. It is important for those employers to recognise, whatever might be the cultural backgrounds of these new Australians and whatever might be universities or other institutions from which they have achieved their qualifications, that it is worth while for them to assess appropriately what the skills of those people are so that Australia does not miss out on effectively using the skills of all people.</PARA>

The document also asks the honourable member to refrain from making such statements in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter goes on to say that if the assurances sought are not forthcoming the writer will strongly advise his client to initiate legal proceedings against the honourable member for Corio. House of Representatives Practice states:</PARA>
<PARA>To attempt by any improper means to influence a Member in his or her conduct as a Member is a contempt. So too is any conduct having a tendency to impair a Member's independence in the future performance of his or her duty . . .</PARA>
<PARA>A United Kingdom House of Commons Committee of Privileges reporting in a somewhat similar case in 1947 had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Your Committee think that the true nature of the privilege involved in the present case can be stated as follows: It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 4 of the Australian Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.</PARA>
<PARA>The question to be determined therefore is whether the letter amounts to an improper interference with the free performance by the honourable member for Corio of his duties as a member. I can appreciate the honourable member's concerns in this matter. Whilst he acknowledges that the letter is written in a courteous manner, he feels that if he complies with the requests made he would be inhibited in the performance of his duties as a member.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter is certainly an attempt to influence him-it makes certain requests of him. The key question is whether it constitutes an attempt at improper influence. In considering this aspect, I believe the letter needs to be seen in light of the matters referred to in it: actions of the honourable member in writing to certain persons and distributing material concerning the Farrow Group.</PARA>
<PARA> Having carefully considered the material and the arguments that have been put before me in this particular matter, I believe this is a borderline case upon which the House would benefit from the advice of the Committee of Privileges. In these circumstances, I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges if the honourable member for Corio wishes to so move.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In raising this matter of public importance today, I should first put on the record the fact that for the past five years the Opposition parties have had, as one of the cornerstones of their policy, the intention to move towards privatisation, to the tune of 100 per cent, of Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. Today in the House we were given an example of why this particular matter of public public importance has been deemed to be so necessary. At this stage we have a situation in Australia where we are still none the wiser as to what exactly Government policy might be. We are still none the wiser as to just how relevant this Parliament is in being able to determine these matters of great moment. We are in a situation where it would seem that the Westminster system of government is under threat because of the line that has been taken by the Government and the union movement on the whole privatisation debate. We believe that the matter should be exposed as widely as possible in the general community of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Acting Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to stand up in the House today and say that this matter has been fermenting for quite some time-I suppose it is true that it has been fermenting for quite some time. Only five years ago, as we heard in Question Time, the Acting Prime Minister, as Treasurer, described privatisation as a Thatcherite vandalism splurge to try to destroy the authorities. In 1987, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself described privatisation as economic and social vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly incredible that the fermentation has been going on for some two years and we are still none the wiser, because two years ago at the 1988 Australian Labor Party (ALP) conference the Prime Minister went after that conference's support for changes on airline funding. The ALP in fact set up a special committee to investigate airline funding needs. That committee to this day is still to report. Of course, we learned as early as 11 July this year that the committee, which is headed by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), still had not reported and that the Minister had been urged to resign because of his support for the Prime Minister. Mr George Campbell, the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union Secretary, argued that his resignation was due, saying that the committee had not met since June last year, that it wanted the issue off the agenda, and that only two out of the nine-member committee supported the changes to the current ALP policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that the thing has been fermenting along. It has been a slow fermentation. In the area of fermentation there is usually a lot of froth and bubble and the end product is usually a giant hangover. The giant hangover is certainly there in terms of public policy in Australia. In terms of the financial situation of Qantas and Australian Airlines there is a giant hangover and the pain is there for the Australian people and Australian industry too. Lack of movement by the Government in this regard has maintained the situation of high international air fares, a failure to be able to fully compete effectively in the international market and the very real difficulties that are facing the government-owned airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Exactly what has brought on this sudden rush? The Government's sudden rush of interest in the airlines privatisation issue was probably firmly put on the agenda on 14 June this year when the Chairman of Australian Airlines, Mr Ted Harris, argued that quasi-equity would not solve the airline's need for funds. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The board takes the view that all it requires in terms of ownership is that we have owners who are responsible and who will enable the airline to compete on level ground. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we will not be able to do that in the future unless we have a proper injection of equity as we borrow more money. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>If the Government can't do that then it should move over and let somebody else do it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harris said he did not understand the argument put by a section of the Labor Party that the airline must remain Government owned. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am not optimistic that quasi equity does overcome the problem. If it doesn't the Board will have to continue to press our case that some form of privatisation should take place. </PARA>
<PARA>Less than a month later, on 4 July, it was revealed that, due to a $700m cut in requested borrowings, Qantas was forced to cancel the orders for five Boeing 747-400 aircraft. At that time the Qantas Chief Executive, John Ward, said that if the Government continued to limit funding options then clearly future growth would be constrained. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is disturbing that a company that has been continually denied access to equity funds now finds that its access to debt funds is also being limited. </PARA>
<PARA>Qantas went on to introduce a scheme to axe 10 per cent of its senior management positions, with 60 employees forced to accept redundancy. But, because of the lack of any sort of flexibility in Qantas, to this day only 37 of those positions have been eliminated and Qantas faces a very serious problem indeed. What has happened to Qantas is a sad reflection on this Government's lack of action, failure to give Qantas its head and failure to move towards a responsible area of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not without significance that of the 35 leading airlines in the world only six are now government owned. Two of those six are Qantas and Aeroflot. Aeroflot is now being split up ready for privatisation. It seems rather incongruous that here in Australia we have a national carrier that looks like going through much more trauma before the issue is fully resolved and that there is the prospect of a privatised Aeroflot before a privatised Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the situation with Qantas? It currently has a fleet of 42 aircraft and says it will need to expand to 80 aircraft by the year 2000 to maintain its present market share. This will require an ongoing capital investment program of more than $1 billion per year. Over the years Qantas, like Australian Airlines, has had difficulties with paid up capital. It is a reflection on both sides of the political fence that has happened. At present Qantas's total paid up capital is $149.4m. The real difficulty Qantas is facing is that its debt equity ratio is 78 : 22 this year. It requires $650m to produce more financially prudent debt equity ratios. Qantas is looking at a ratio of about 65 : 35 by June 1991, but the real truth is that if Qantas is going to become competitive with the major international carriers it requires $1.15 billion to reduce its debt equity ratio to the 55 : 45 level. That would allow the company to compete with some of its major competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas will need more money than that just for its ongoing expansion program. It is saying at the moment that its projected profits are being reduced by approximately $140m because of the higher debt equity ratio. As I said, Qantas went to the Loan Council this year-this was how serious the situation was-and sought $1,143m to get it out of its problem. This Government, which is so terribly concerned, as we heard today, with maintaining the standards of our airlines, gave it the princely sum of $477m. That shortfall is going to cause Qantas some very real concern indeed. There will be a run-down in its cash position. There has already been a deferral of new aircraft orders. </PARA>
<PARA> If Qantas goes on in the same mode throughout 1991-92 as it is going at present the impact will be even more severe because it will be cancelling future aircraft orders and it will not be able to compete with the international carriers that are coming through. Qantas, if it is going to maintain its present position as a leading world carrier, has to make some major changes, and it has to make them soon. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no indication from this Government that even on a 49 per cent equity basis we are going to get any real action for Qantas. We do not really know yet what the foreign ownership provisions will be. The present Chairman of Qantas, Mr Dix, has talked about introducing some foreign funding for Qantas. Yet we hear the Prime Minister say that as far as he is concerned he wants to see the majority shareholding remain in Australia. If we are talking about foreign funding we have to look at funding levels of up to 35 per cent to get real interest in Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we looking at a situation where we will have carriers such as British Airways, Japan Air Lines and Lufthansa investing in Qantas? Will Qantas be able to get into those international arrangements without interference as a result of next Monday's ALP national conference? Qantas has to do something like that. It has to get into such a position that it can compete with those international carriers. At the moment there are all sorts of alliances being undertaken around the world by major carriers to prepare themselves for the deregulation of the European market in 1992. They are going to take the deregulated American market head on. </PARA>
<PARA> One can give some interesting examples, such as comparing Qantas with the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). The Scandinavian Airlines System is very similar to ours. SAS operates from the northern end of the world. It is at the end of the run. Australia sits at the south at the end of the run. SAS is represented by three countries and they have roughly the same combined population as Australia. If we look at the ratio now, we see that the Scandinavian Airlines System has a fleet of about 120 aircraft and it is expanding. It has already moved into a cross-shareholding regime. SAS has gone in with Texas Air, which is part of Continental Airlines. It has a share arrangement with British Midland Airlines, Swissair, Austrian Airlines and Delta Airlines. It also has some marketing alliances with Thai Airways International, Aerolineas Argentinas, All Nippon Airways, Canadian Airlines International, Finnair and Lan Chile. All we have done in Australia is allow Qantas to go in on a 19 per cent holding of Air New Zealand. That is all very well and good and I guess that is a start. But basically all we have managed to let Qantas do is expand the capital base of Air New Zealand while its own is running down. That means that Qantas has some real problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some 39 foreign airlines operating into Australia. Of those 39 airlines, 26 are privatised carriers; 13 are fully government owned. Such luminaries that are government owned include Yugoslav Airlines, Olympic Airways, Air India, Air China, Garuda Indonesia, Merpati, Air Nauru, Air Niugini, Air Vanuatu, Cook Island International, Polynesian Airlines, and Solomon Islands Airways. There are no major carriers there, yet Qantas is expected to go out into the international market and bring business into Australia at competitive rates. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the real situation we should look at what is happening in the tourism industry at the moment. That is one that is always on the boil and one where airline reform is most urgently needed. We should look at the upturn from the Japanese market. We have been sitting here during the last week thumping our chests, saying how well we are doing in getting the Japanese tourists back. We have done well but we still have less than one per cent of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain fact is that the prices of airline tickets between Japan and Australia are amongst the highest in the world. If one looks at real competition, one realises that the only reasons for our success in Japan are, first, that we have had some good promotion there and, secondly, that we are a new market and there is still quite a bit of interest in Australia. Despite the high air fares, the Japanese are coming here anyway. When we really do have to compete, the real area of competition will be Hawaii. The prices of airline tickets for roughly the same distance-between Tokyo and Hawaii-are about one-third of those being charged on the duopolist route between Japan and Australia. This is the sort of area that we have to get into. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the equipment problems that are now facing Australian Airlines are equally critical. I was speaking to a board member of Australian Airlines the other day who was saying that there was just no cash there. We have already seen a situation where Australian Airlines is starting to send some of its aircraft overseas and is undertaking some major sales of aircraft to reduce its capacity so that it will be in a better financial situation to try to compete with Ansett and any other new carriers that might come in at the time of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian airline industry is facing a most critical time indeed. It has been facing a critical time for the last two or three years and yet we are still waiting until next Monday to ascertain exactly what will happen. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes into this House today and says that Cabinet has made its decision, but all one has to do is look at the weekend papers to see what has happened in terms of those special Australian Labor Party conferences. In the three major States, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the special meetings at the weekend threw out completely the concept of the Government moving into the privatisation of the airlines or, indeed, any other instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a real problem in forcing the trade union movement to accept privatisation. From the Opposition side I think we must wish this Government well in its efforts, because if we do not and if some sort of privatisation does not come into play, then Qantas and Australian Airlines could well be in trouble. Privatisation to the tune of 100 per cent is the only way that we will be able to undertake that major micro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The failure of the Government to outline a coherent privatisation strategy for public enterprises, including the airlines . . .</PARA>
<PARA>When someone raises such a matter we are entitled to expect that person to come into the chamber with a coherent privatisation strategy. In fact, Opposition members have not got a coherent privatisation strategy. What they have is a fire sale strategy, a strategy based on ideology rather than on the requirements of the economy overall or the requirements of the specific government business enterprises. It is the Government now and the Government alone which has a policy in the area of privatisation-a policy which matches the circumstances in which the particular enterprises find themselves, relates them to their current situation in the economy, and approaches the issue with less emphasis on ideology and more on overall performance. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the Opposition's position on this issue of privatisation? It is to sell Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC), Aussat Pty Ltd, Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines and the Australian National Line. Its policy is to sell all the government business enterprises simultaneously. That means that something like $30 billion to $35 billion worth of assets will be dumped on the Australian market, and this is supposed to constitute a policy. The saving of these particular institutions is supposed to be some sort of contribution to the betterment of the Australian economy and a better performance by all. That is a load of nonsense. It is simply not possible to implement a privatisation strategy based on the Opposition's plans and regard it as anything other than a scandalous fire sale to the wealthy in this community and overseas of some assets that have been built up by the Australian taxpayers and by the operators of those operations over years and years. That sort of attitude is not new in connection with the views of governments that do not approach this from the point of view of the economic good overall or the benefit of the particular enterprise or the market in which it operates. However, this approach is in keeping with the traditions of those who come into this debate with the motive of ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> The most dramatic example of what happens when that approach is adopted is what transpired in the United Kingdom in the case of the partial privatisation of British Telecom. Like this Opposition, the British Government effectively mixed two problems. One was the problem of introducing competition in an area where competition is required; the other an ideological commitment to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> What occurred as a result of mixing the two? Firstly, there was no effective competition. It is only now, when they are contemplating the types of interconnect policies and the other things that are essential for effective competition in the telecommunications area, that competition is developing in Britain. The Australian Government is contemplating those issues now, at the beginning of the process, not at the end of it. As a result of the policies of the British Government, there was no competition in the area of telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> The British Government received #2.5 billion for the sale of 49 per cent of British Telecom. That amount represents probably one-fifth of the actual value of 49 per cent of that enterprise at that time. If honourable members opposite think that by dumping these enterprises on the Australian capital markets they will get full value for Qantas Airways Ltd, which is probably $2 billion or more, and full value for Australian Airlines, which is probably close to $1 billion, while at the same time trying to get $15 billion for Telecom and $5 billion for OTC Ltd, they are a bunch of maniacs. That is all there is to it. It is simply not conceivable that the Australian public will receive the return to which it is entitled if those government operations are sold down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition approaches this matter on an ideological basis. It is interesting that the whole structure of political debate about government business enterprises has changed markedly in this country. For the bulk of the history of the institution of parliamentary democracy in Australia, it has been common ground between Government and Opposition that there should be a mixed economy, and that there is a role for the public sector in that mixed economy. That role is probably quite substantial in a developing country such as Australia, with the sorts of distances and small population sizes that prevail. There will always be a requirement for a healthy public sector. The question is always to get the balance right. That has been the common ground position between Government and Opposition over the years. We sought instead to concentrate debate on social welfare issues, the development of education policy, foreign affairs and defence issues, not on that fundamental issue.</PARA>
<PARA> That position has changed completely. The Labor Government is prepared to look constructively at the capital requirements of the various entities for which it is responsible. It is prepared to look at their management requirements, where they stand in the marketplace, what they require to be able to perform effectively in the marketplace, and, where there remains no justification for their position in the marketplace, to take them from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has not been inactive in this area. Since it has been in office, some $2 billion worth of government services have been taken out of the government sector and put onto a private contracting basis. When I confronted the requirement to devise a contract to construct frigates in this country, I coupled with that at that time-which was the right time-the issue of the privatisation of Williamstown Naval Dockyard. When the Commonwealth Bank absolutely required a capital injection, effectively in order for it to be able to grow and to continue to perform the essential stabilising role that it performs in the Australian banking sector, this Government put in place a capacity for the bank to sell down to the tune of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not threaten these government entities or abandon them to the private sector to sink or swim on some ideological commitment. It made sensible decisions at a sensible pace, and it will continue to ensure that the Australian people receive full value for these enterprises. That is not the position of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can sit there and guffaw away all he likes, but he is one of those responsible for these policy idiocies. The Opposition is going to have to live with that and we are going to pursue it on them. We are going to pursue it particularly in the telecommunications area, where it has sacrificed the essential issues of competition for a mindless ideological commitment to privatisation. What we are going to get from that, of course, is enormous public disturbance at the fact that their assets will be sold for a song to what will appear to be the wealthy friends of the Government-if those opposite get into government. If the Opposition ever gets that opportunity, it will be very much to its discredit were that to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are going through, within our Party processes, a sensible analysis of what might be done for these entities. It is not as though they have done badly under the regime that we have had in place to this point. Let me just produce a few figures for the Opposition on that. When we came into office Qantas had a fleet of some 24 aircraft. That was only seven years ago. It had had that level of aircraft for a very considerable period before that. It now has a fleet of 42. From being in a situation in 1983-84 where it was flying 24.8 billion seat kilometres, we now have in place a capacity in Qantas to fly 39.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Qantas was making virtually nothing in the five years prior to our assuming office. Since then, it has been regularly providing dividends to the Government-a record dividend in 1988-89 and substantial dividend payments over the period as a whole. Let me compare. Between 1983-84 and 1988-89, dividends from Qantas totalled $132.7m; from 1975-76 to 1982-83, $6.2 million. Total shareholders funds as at 30 June 1989 were $916.5m compared with $244.4m for Qantas in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> One sees a similar performance in the case of Australian. This year Australian has taken a hell of a knock, as one would expect, having been knocked out of the sky for effectively a third of the year by the pilots dispute. Prior to that Australian recorded an operating profit of $108m. That compares with the best year in the Opposition's term of office of $14m and an average performance of about $4m or $5m. That $108m was preceded by one of $66m, one before that of $42m, one before that of $37m, and one before that of $28m. </PARA>
<PARA> Under our management, these airlines have in fact done very well. What we are looking at in the context of selling down a proportion of Qantas, our national flag carrier, the carrier of our bilateral relations with a number of other countries in the aviation area, effectively is selling if not quite a monopolistic position then certainly a monopolistic Australian overseas involvement position, of which the Opposition would sell 100 per cent and of which we, in the positions we are putting forward and which we are suggesting to conference, would sell around 49 per cent. We are doing it not because of some ideological commitment to the issue of privatisation but because it seems in the interests of the airline that we should approach it in that way now. We approach the issue of Australian not because of some ideological commitment that Australian ought to be taken out of the public sector but because we think that there are other things that ought to be done in the public sector with injections of capital that would be capable of being implemented were Australian taken out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is our approach. We do in fact have a program associated with the steps-and there have been many since we have been in office-towards privatisation, towards more competitive markets, towards freeing up our public entities to act in a commercial manner. To their credit, they have returned to us tenfold what we put into them in giving them that freedom of action-the freedom of action they never had. One thing we have done to them is to increase the competitiveness of the markets in which they have operated, and they have responded to that very effectively. There were 23 international carriers flying to Australia when we took office. There are now 37. We have liberalised international freight and passenger charter policy, and freight charters have now more than doubled since 1987, and of course exponentially above what they were back in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> We are the people who address these issues in government. Those opposite are the people who, when they are presented with these opportunities when they are in government, do nothing. Then, in paroxysms of guilt for their total failure to address from the conservative side the proper management of government affairs, they come in with this totally mindless policy in which they sell off everything lickety split. That is the major concern-not what is happening in the markets or what is happening in international aviation or the domestic aviation market, not what is happening in the markets with regards to telecommunications. That is all irrelevant! What we have is a major commitment to privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in this country can thank God that the Opposition never had an opportunity to implement its policies during the 1980s. Can anyone imagine where we would now be standing had the Opposition gone through with its fire sale privatisations during the course of the 1980s and who might now have been owning those airlines? Qantas-Skase Air and Australian-Bond Aviation are what we would have been looking at now. </PARA>

<PARA> The Opposition, apart from its mindlessness on this matter, has adopted a certain approach on all these sorts of issues. In so far as there has been any damage experienced by these public enterprises to this point, the Opposition has made a major contribution.

The only losses that Australian and Qantas have had to suffer really since we have been in office have been a direct result of a dispute which the Opposition encouraged and gave active aid and comfort to.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary performance! I would have thought better of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). First of all, the Minister starts to try to rewrite history and then he lets his mates go-Bond, Skase and others. If the Minister wanted us to, we could talk about Rothwell-Beazley Airlines. To try to rewrite history and privatise the way that the Minister is trying to, he is just too gutless to come up and say what he knows ought to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister started by saying that our policy was a fire sale policy and that we did not have a strategy. The Minister knows, as do many members of the Parliament, members of the public and certainly many members of the business community, that we have a privatisation policy that was welcomed by 90 per cent of the business community in a survey done by the Business Review Weekly prior to the last election-the policy that was applauded most by all economic commentators going into the last election as being the most responsible and most responsive to the economic plight that this nation was suffering under the Minister's tutelage. </PARA>
<PARA> What were the four key things that we said in our privatisation policy were important? First of all, though, let me debunk one of the other myths that the Minister and his colleagues up in the Senate are trying to perpetuate. It is like an orchestrated parrot production from the other side of the House. The Minister picked a couple of lines and is running them as fast as he can up there in the press gallery in the hope that the press will pick them up, and the Minister knows that they are not buying it, because he read the newspapers at the weekend as well. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we say? Support for privatisation does not stem from preferred ideological position; rather it is a recognition that private companies operating in competition offer the best opportunity for the efficient delivery of services to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) say today about privatisation? He said-and I took a note-that privatisation may improve efficiency and is a better allocation of resources. So the Acting Prime Minister agrees with our policy. The Minister and the Opposition both know that the Government has now decided to pick up the privatisation policies that have been enunciated in 83 other countries around the world, including by this Opposition, and now, finally, the Government has recognised that its economic policies are putting this country into hock and that it has to address these broad issues. </PARA>
<PARA> What are those four broad issues? The first point in privatisation that we say is important is that of funding, and I shall return to that in a moment. The second point is efficiency and Australia's economic performance. The third point is consumer benefits. Whatever happened to people? This Government is governing for selected vested interests, and not worrying any more about the public of Australia. What about employee participation, what about employee share ownership programs (ESOP)? The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was the first member of this place to talk about ESOPs. </PARA>

<PARA> It is a tragedy for Australians that this debate should even take place, because this week we can see the Government for what it really is: it is governed by factions and beholden to outside vested interests. Never was there a clearer example of that than at the weekend when senior unionists said, `Anyone from the Government who votes'-one of the 101 faceless men next Monday-`any one of them who is a parliamentarian and who votes, we will make sure that we vote against his preselection'. </PARA>
<PARA> All of a sudden history is being revisited. We are going back to the days of Calwell and Whitlam, standing outside under the lamp, while the 36 faceless men were inside. There are a few more now. But only 32 per cent of people in this country are unionists. So the representatives of 32 per cent of the community are dictating to the Government, from outside the Parliament, as to the direction in which the economic decisions should be going in this country. It is an absolute tragedy that this is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> We are having the contrived arguments, the feigned indignation by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) about public ownership versus private ownership. That serves only to illustrate his total hypocrisy and his cynicism towards the Australian people. The Government knows what has to be done about the airline situation, but refuses to do it-and why? Because the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is living in the past and it is irrelevant to the needs of our future and the rapid economic expansion of the Pacific Rim. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish that the Minister for Transport and Communications were still in the chamber, because three weeks ago we had a matter of public importance debated in the House and the Minister did his nana and would not debate me. He decided to call off the debate. Sitting in my room were members of a parliamentary delegation from Poland. They came to this Parliament to talk about issues that were important to them. Who did they come to see? They did not go to see the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is in the chamber at present; they came to see a backbencher, a shadow Minister from this side of the House, because they were interested in this policy of privatisation. Opposition members are the only ones who have some vision about where we should go. Why are people from eastern Europe coming to Australia to find out? They thought they were coming to the nirvana of free enterprise and capitalism. But they got a shock. </PARA>

Members of the Polish delegation wanted to know how the Government was going to deal with privatisation in Australia. I told them that the Opposition had a policy on it. What did they say about the Government? They said, `Well, the Government told us this morning that everything is fine'. I said, `But did they tell you about the equity situation, the need for more money for airlines to buy equipment, so that Qantas and Australian Airlines can be competitive, so that the people from those airlines will not be coming back and saying that they want more taxes so that they can put more money into the airlines?'. What about the inefficiency of the airlines? The seating cost allocation for Australian Airlines is twice that of any United States of America carrier.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Fadden is an acknowledged expert in aviation matters. Did Government members listen to him today? I shall repeat what he said so that they shall be aware of it. This is the briefing I got from Qantas two weeks ago. It gave me exactly the same information that had been given to the Government. With regard to equity needs, current paid-up capital is $149.4m; there is an unacceptably high debt equity ratio of 78 : 22 for 1990-91; $650m is required to produce a more financially prudent debt equity ratio of 65 : 35 by June 1991, and further equity contributions will be required over time to support the ongoing investment program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel should look at the graph. It shows-and I will show it to my colleagues as well- that Qantas has the highest debt equity ratio of any airline in the world. That is the problem that the Government should have addressed, but it has not addressed that matter. This airline is starving. If 100 per cent of this airline had been put up for sale three years ago, it would have been possible to get in the vicinity of $1.4 billion for it. Now, if 49 per cent of it is put up for sale, as the Government probably will propose, it might get $200m for it. The Government has run down the airline. The globalisation of aircraft operators in this world is moving apace, and Qantas cannot be a part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not hear anything from the Minister about British Airways or the dramatic turnaround that privatisation visited upon that airline to the benefit not only of the employees-and do not forget the employees-but also of the taxpayers in the United Kingdom. I went to the United Kingdom and I talked to the Chairman of British Airways, Lord King of Wartnaby, and his Managing Director about the benefits of privatisation and what it can do for an airline if one has imaginative management and also if one lowers the debt requirements. But the problem is that continuing debt has an effect on the bottom line. What is the effect on the bottom line for Qantas? Its projected profit on operations in 1991 has been reduced by approximately $140m due to its debt equity ratio being higher than that of its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> We have put ourselves in a very uncompetitive situation because the Government wants to continue with its ideological position. It is not we who have the ideological position. We are taking the economically responsible path to dealing with the airlines' equity problems. We do not have the ideological hangups. We have set down the reasons why there should be privatisation, in common-as I keep on saying-with 83 other countries; there are socialist, communist and autocratic governments right around the world all agreeing that privatisation is an economic tool. It is not a panacea; it is an economic tool that must be embraced in order to mobilise community savings more effectively-and, again, the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer acknowledged that fact in Question Time today-and to have better resource allocation so that we do not have to go back to the taxpayers and ask them to fund things that they should not be funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of government is to steer; it is not to man the oars. This Government has to remember that there is a great change taking place in this world. It is taking place in the heart of eastern Europe. People from eastern Europe come here to ask us how to do things. They do not come and ask the Government because it is living in the past. This conference on 24 September is about the ALP trying to hang onto the past. It does not have any vision of the future. It is taking us nowhere. Where is the Prime Minister? Events have conspired to take him out of the country this week. How ironic that he is away. The Acting Prime Minister had a chance in Question Time today to say exactly what he thought of the matter, to be a leader and a statesman, and he squibbed it. He squibs it every time the pressure is on. Woe betide this country if he ever becomes Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by addressing the quote of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) when he talked so reverently about the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in relation to employee share ownership schemes. He said that the honourable member for Bennelong was the first person in this House to talk about those things. I will start with the simple premise: it is all very well to talk about it, but one has to be able to deliver it. Members on the other side of the House have raised a long litany of ills in our economy that need to be fixed, but they have only ever talked about them. When it came to the hard decision to actually do something, where was the Opposition when it had its opportunity? I do not intend to spend this 10 minutes that I have available talking about the Opposition's role. There are a lot more things that we can work towards in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This proposition today talks about the effect on the economy of the failure of the Government to run a coherent policy on privatisation. Before I turn to the matter of the airlines, I will look at the failure of the Opposition to come to grips, in the years and years it was in office, with the two-airline policy. When during its period in office did we see an advertisement offering half-price fares across the Nullarbor Plains? When did we see any real competition in air fares? All we ever saw was a two-airline policy in the name of competition which, in effect, guaranteed fixed prices, high costs, overstaffing and the Australian consumer paying through the nose. In fact, show me anywhere in the economy where the Opposition has marched in with its free market, competitive ideal and actually managed to deliver on it. It just has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the facts. It is all right to talk, but let us actually see the Opposition do something. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), in winding up his remarks, touched upon a very significant matter in this debate. It is all very well for the honourable member for Bass to raise the question of the anticipated reduction in profits of Qantas Airways Ltd this year. Certainly, the anticipated profits of Qantas are going to be down, as are those of Australian Airlines Ltd. But the honourable member made no mention whatsoever of the real reason why. The real reason is that for almost six months Australia's domestic aviation was sitting on the ground while Opposition members were encouraging the airline pilots in their fruitless dispute. That is the reason why Qantas does not have passengers. The reason we have had to go and spend literally millions and millions of dollars overseas cranking up Australia's tourism industry again is that the airline pilots ground it to a halt. That is the reason why Australian Airlines has had suddenly to declare its loss this year. When six months are cut out of the revenue, brought about by an industrial dispute of that kind, cranked up every day in this House by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull)-who Opposition members acknowledge as their leading spokesman in the field-of course there will be effects. So the honourable member should not come in here and preach about the effects on the economy of the Government's failure to run a coherent policy on privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now turn to the issue of privatisation. Who is actually facing up to the fact that the airlines need equity partners and that in very recent times the world aviation industry and our domestic aviation industry are changing and changing rapidly? Who is actually facing up to the fact that the airlines have to have partners, have to share mutual facilities at different airports and have to be able to share computer systems and booking systems in order to be able to handle each other's passengers and baggage, cross selling and tourism and all those things? Who is facing up to the fact that the airlines need equity injections not only from the private capital market, but also from strategic exchanges with other airlines in order to promote their role in the global aviation industry? We are facing up to that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the way in which we are facing up to it is by holding a national conference of the Australian Labor Party in Canberra next week because the ALP at least recognises the fact that the decisions it made at the Hobart conference in 1988 cannot hold static and be binding on the Party, on the Government and on those who accept and follow ALP policies-and we were elected to put them in place-until 1991 when we have our next conference. Of course we cannot do that. So when there is a major shift in policy, brought about by rapidly changing world situations and circumstances, we have a national conference and we are accountable to our people and our policy-making structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the Government is to be commended for that process of reference to its members. The Minister is right when he says that the Opposition has this crazy fixation with flogging off assets for the money. As the Minister pointed out, if one goes through the Opposition's shopping list for the fire sale, one sees that something like $40 billion worth of assets in today's terms is being offered. These assets, be they aircraft, airports, Telecom Australia, Aussat Pty Ltd, OTC Ltd or whatever, have been built up year by year by the investment of government or public funds, the retention of profits and by strategic operations in one form or another. It has not all been a massive injection of capital. But when one goes to sell them, one is, in fact, saying to the world and to the Australian capital markets, `Here it all is, let's have the money'. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Opposition think the effect will be on interest rates in this country when it suddenly says to the market place, `Find $25, $30 or $40 billion for these assets'? The Opposition should not try to say we are not talking about this kind of money, because right at the heart of its policy is a commitment, in its first term of office, to sell Telecom. Telecom is the biggest single public institution in this country. It is valued conservatively at $25 billion. Where will we find $25 billion in this economy, if it is not borrowed capital from high fliers who are running around looking for somewhere to milk some profits? It is in the Opposition's policy to do that. That is not feasible, it is not responsible and it does nothing to help the stability and the comeback of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the decision the Government took to allow the Commonwealth Bank to buy the State Bank of Victoria and, in doing so, to raise an extra shareholding to pay for that by a 30 per cent sell down. That was not just a matter of the Government deciding to say to the Commonwealth Bank, `Slip down to the nearest stockbroker, stick it out there in the market and let us see how you go'. What the Government has decided to do is to explore some very strategic innovations in the Australian economy. The first thing that has been guaranteed for the first time in public enterprise in this country is that there will be a slice of that action for the employees; there will be an employee ownership package. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the honourable member for Bennelong to be given the credit as the first person in the House to raise this matter. I do not know whether the honourable member was. However, I can tell the House that lots of us in the trade union movement have been talking for decades about employee ownership. The Opposition might have only thought about it recently; it might have thought and spoken about it; but the Government is actually doing it, and that is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The second phase of the tendering for the Commonwealth Bank is that there will be a slice of the action for the superannuation funds, a slice of the action for ordinary people's savings-many people who never had the opportunity for superannuation at any time during the Opposition's 20 years in office since 1950 or whenever it was. Since the introduction by the Government of the two-tiered system, every worker now has superannuation. That money is going into superannuation schemes. The savings of ordinary workers are now going into superannuation schemes and the opportunity will now be available for them to be invested in profitable public enterprise. The Government is not just talking about it; it is doing something about it, and doing it in a coherent and structured way that, when all this is weighed up, takes our economy down the road of continuing as quite possibly the world's most successful mixed economy. </PARA>
<PARA> So I do not have any problems in explaining that to people. I shall certainly have no problems in defending it at election time, and I think that this matter is lacking in substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the report relating to the following proposed work:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Construction of Perth Office and Warehouse complex for the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Joint Committee of Public Works has concluded that there is a need for the construction of a Perth office and warehouse complex for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The proposed office building will have an area of 5,508 square metres on two levels and the area of the warehouse is proposed to be 1,120 square metres. The cost of $13.926m will be reduced by the sale of the CAA's warehouse site at Mount Claremont in Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee heard evidence that the Western Australian field office of the CAA is presently located in expensive leased accommodation in the Perth central business district. The lease on this property expires in October 1991. The CAA accepted the report of a consultant who recommended the move from the leased accommodation to Perth Airport because leasing costs are high; CAA's major clients are at Perth Airport; and staff savings could be made by relocating the office staff. The CAA purchased a suitable block at Perth Airport in November 1988. The Committee supports the CAA's belief that it should be in a decentralised location close to its clients. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few brief points I should like to make in connection with this report. First, the roof of the warehouse at Mount Claremont contains asbestos sheeting. Evidence was given that this is safe provided it is undisturbed. Should a new owner decide to demolish the building care will need to be taken to adhere to the appropriate West Australian code of practice for the removal of this material. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Committee was told that use of solar panels for heating water within the proposed buildings was not found to be practical commercially. It reiterates the point made during last week's tabling of the report into the Australian Taxation Office's dedicated computer centre: means of improving energy efficiency in new buildings will be kept under scrutiny by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, the CAA's original proposal had included sale of its workshop at Mount Lawley. The combination of a National Trust classification on the main building, restrictions on construction on the block and uncertainty about the future of the CAA's workshops combined to remove this from the proposal. The Committee accepts this situation and, while not making a recommendation on the issue, endorses the principle of bringing all relevant CAA operations to Perth Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there were concerns expressed about such things as public transport to the airport, banking and child-care facilities and the cost and availability of food in that part of the airport. The Committee notes that the CAA has been seeking to ensure these services are adequate for the staff at Perth Airport. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday evening I was referring to the introduction of the deeming provisions contained in the Budget as they affect age pensioners. Of course, this refers to money held by pensioners in low or interest free accounts, which from March of next year will be assumed to be earning 10 per cent except for the first $2,000. I simply make the point that this will not affect single pensioners who have around $20,000 or married pensioners with $35,000 between them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am surprised that there has been some concern expressed in the pensioner community about this, particularly about the amount of $2,000 excluded from the scheme. It is a matter of some surprise to me that anybody would want to keep an amount of $2,000 sitting in an interest-free account. It is always better for pensioners to have that earning some interest because, without taking tax into account, they will always be 50c better off for each extra dollar that is earned in interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The other worthwhile feature of that scheme is that those who would otherwise not be eligible for the fringe benefits card will in fact preserve their rights. While dealing with deeming provisions, I should make one comment about an article that appeared in the Sunday Telegraph of 26 August headed `Pensioners to lose 83c in the dollar'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>For every dollar a single pensioner's investment yields over $40 a week... Social Security will cut the pension by 50c. The Taxation Department will take another 33c. </PARA>
<PARA>That will leave the pensioner, the article suggests, with just 17c from each surplus dollar. I simply want to make the point that this article, which did not have a by-line, is incorrect. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. It also shows a very poor understanding of the tax scales. An increase in income of $1 and a reduction in pension of 50c as a result, of course, leaves a gross income increase of 50c. The tax on that would be levied at the rate of 21c in the dollar, yielding 10.5c for the 50c. So a pensioner in that position would be 39.5c a week better off, and not the figure suggested by the article.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, it does illustrate the different approaches taken to this Budget by the media. Some sections of the media attempted to label the Budget a harsh Budget as it affected the needy. It is interesting that, on the other hand, the Opposition has consistently referred to the Budget as being far too soft. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the fourth group to which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) directed his appeal in his speech, that is, youth. We certainly get out and talk to young people and we recognise and appreciate all that the Government has been able to achieve for them over the last seven years. There is wide recognition in the community, I am glad to say, that retention rates under this Government have almost doubled. Almost two-thirds of young Australians now enjoy a complete secondary education. Young people also appreciate the wider opportunities that are available in higher education, improvements in student assistance, and more opportunities through growth in the job market and more training opportunities, particularly through the Australian traineeship system. We are very pleased as a government to be able to note that unemployment has very rapidly disappeared as an option for those in the 16 to 18-year-old age group. It is a particularly hollow appeal coming from an Opposition which when in government presided over the highest level of youth unemployment in our country's history. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not take very long to refer to the so-called answers that the Leader of the Opposition promised at the beginning of his speech. He referred again to the Opposition's promise to abolish the unemployment benefit after a period of nine months. In fact, this remains a confidence trick, as it did during the election campaign, because this would simply involve a question of changing the name of the benefit for those who remained out of work after nine months. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. At the same time the Opposition promised to abolish a range of training programs which had been put in place to assist those people who are out of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, the Opposition's promises on tax reform remain unclear. It has made a choice in favour of a goods and services tax, but it refuses to tell us at what rate it will apply, on what goods and services it will be levied, what kind of relief will be available for pay-as-you-earn taxpayers and what kind of compensation will be made available for pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition also claimed that the Budget did nothing to boost national savings either in the public sector or indirectly. I remind the House that this is the fourth successive surplus under this Government, a surplus of more than $8 billion, and it comes after a period where we inherited a prospective deficit of $9.3 billion back in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that it is his speech and not the Budget which needs to be redone. It needs to be redone on a proper assessment of what Australia needs. His assessment is certainly based on a flawed analysis and his speech lacked that package of essential measures and answers that he promised at the beginning. I suggest, in closing, that there is much more to being Leader of the Opposition than simply changing the place where he buys his shirts. What the Leader of the Opposition needs to do is take the Australian people into his confidence and produce viable and detailed alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget, the Government's eighth attempt at getting it right, has once again got it wrong. This was the post-election Budget, the first Budget of the new Parliament, a great opportunity to take some far-sighted and correct decisions. We all know that the closer to elections, the more governments show a remarkable lack of desire to move in that direction. In fact, it was an opportunity to lead and an opportunity which was missed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If this Budget had a set of objectives, they were best described by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on page two of his Budget Speech, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up. </PARA>
<PARA>On the present record, to achieve any of these goals will be very difficult indeed and the Treasurer's undue optimism over recent years is surely good reason for our concern. In the Budget Speech of 1988-89 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policies will secure for Australia an inflation rate of three to four per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>My word, he certainly was wrong then! In the same Budget Speech, he also said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are now well on our way back to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet all the indices today are going in exactly the opposite direction. Who will forget his comments made in the previous year when he claimed that he had brought home the bacon?</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's lack of achievable goals, given the direction of the economy, has confirmed everyone's worst fears that the Hawke Government has no clear, long term view and no strategy to save the Australian economy from the recession which has been largely caused by its own policy failures. The Government's objectives, surely, should be threefold: firstly, to cut government spending even further; secondly, to reshape our taxation system; and, thirdly, to boost national savings. Regrettably, on all three counts it has failed in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Government spending must be reduced as a means of controlling inflation. At least it must be comparable to that of our major trading partners. We must reform the taxation system if we are seriously to restore incentive and encourage productivity in the Australian work force. We must boost national savings if we want to reduce dependence on foreign investment and help to pay off our massive overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA> The continued reliance on a tight monetary policy, which for at least the last two years has been the centre point of the Government's economic strategy, has clearly not achieved the results that this misguided Treasurer had hoped for it, unless, of course, those results were a massive rise in unemployment and a substantial increase in business failures. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is the destruction of living standards for Australian families; record levels of personal bankruptcies-up a mere 11 per cent in the last financial year; small business failures at an unprecedented level since the days of the Great Depression; and the list goes on. Real earnings have fallen over four years, yet increased productivity under this Government's economic and industrial policies has failed to eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of Australians and their families have clearly suffered as a result of the last eight Labor Budgets. Let us consider the following statistics, which make this point. In 1982-83, the current account deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was 3.9 per cent. In 1988-89, it was 5.5 per cent. In 1982-83, the small overdraft rate was 14 per cent, and for 1989-90, 22 per cent, although it is now slightly lower. In 1982-83, gross foreign debt was $35.9 billion; in 1989-90, $156 billion. In 1982-83, the weekly income required to support mortgage repayments was 19.2 per cent. In 1989-90, it had risen to 36 per cent. I note an editorial in the West Australian newspaper which said:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating must be joking in asserting that `economic policy has worked and is working'. If the hardship that Australians have endured in the past year is a sign that economic policy is working then heaven help us when things really go bad. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a sad fact which should be clear to every member of this House that even before this Budget was drawn up-and certainly since it-economic realities have significantly changed to our detriment, and yet the Government imagines that, having hit the iceberg like the Titanic, we can remain afloat on other people's money indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does nothing to address inflation. In the 1988-89 Budget Speech the Treasurer said that inflation would be down to 3 or 4 per cent. In fact, it is now over 7 per cent. The Budget contains nothing to prevent the large projected fall in business investment. While most parts of the economy now languish in recession, the Treasurer blithely claims that his policies are on track and are working. Working for whom? On which track? Where does the line take us?</PARA>
<PARA> How does the Treasurer anticipate this country's overcoming its foreign debt problems when the levels of business investment are falling? Yet we all remember that last year he claimed that they were, in fact, rising. We heard in Question Time today the Treasurer make a malicious attack on the Business Council of Australia (BCA). I quote from the information paper put out by the BCA at the time of the recent debt summit:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the 1980s there has been only a minor increase in the size of the capital stock relative to total production. This 'capital intensity' ratio has barely moved-from 2.8 in 1979 to 2.9 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the pick-up in investment in the last few years, Australia Pty Ltd has not been going through a massive re-equipment programme.</PARA>
<PARA>That is contrary, I might add, to what was claimed by the Treasurer last year. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The investment which has taken place over the last decade has not been sufficient to produce the surge in Australia's productive capacity required to trade our way out of our debt problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, the quality of our capital stock has deteriorated in terms of its capacity to service our foreign debt. Over the past decade we have invested relatively more in housing (from which we earn no income on world markets) than in business assets. </PARA>
<PARA> In part that deterioration in quality is due to biases introduced by the interaction of our tax system with inflation-reducing savings and distorting . . . investment in physical assets (towards housing and `paper shuffling' and away from productive assets). </PARA>
<PARA> Further with some notable exceptions (like tourism, mining and particular areas in manufacturing) our use of the funds also is under question. Such growth in the capital stock that has occurred over the last decade has tended to be concentrated in areas that tend primarily to serve the domestic market rather than those that compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Budget Statement No. 2 of the 1989-90 Budget, the share of investment going into production of goods and services that compete in export markets or against imports has fallen over the past two years to below 50 per cent (after a rise between 1985 and 1987) and is still well below the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of the premises upon which the Budget is based are dodgy, to say the least. The Government has ignored the economic impact of the Middle East crisis. The Budget is predicated on an average inflation rate of 6.5 per cent, which in turn depends on the price of oil averaging $23 a barrel. The Government's accord mark 4 wages deal with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) would limit wage rises to 7 per cent. This is based on a predicated average inflation rate of 6.5 per cent, which in turn depends on the price of oil averaging $23 a barrel. In fact, it is already $31.78 a barrel. The Treasurer is indeed a supreme optimist if he imagines the problems of the Middle East will suddenly go away when clearly they may well be with us for much of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> But probably the most rubbery figures of all were those given by the Treasurer in regard to unemployment. Estimates from Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu predict the labour market collapsing in the coming months as unemployment rises to a national peak of approximately 8 per cent. We will be back in the bad old days of 1982-83 which the Treasurer so likes to quote. In all those eight to nine years, where have we been? The Treasurer has done nothing more than complete the circle of our demise. </PARA>
<PARA> While Labor's reform agenda has been proved by this Budget to be non-existent, the coalition's policies are by contrast decisive and clear. We believe that an industrial relations reform package to deregulate Australia's labour markets is absolutely essential. We put forward that package in the last election, as we did the election before that. Yet the Government's moves in the area of labour market deregulation and reform have been pitifully slow, to say the least. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of telecommunications reform we would introduce privatisation as the basis for greater competition in this key industry. Again the Labor Government is utterly divided within itself on the approach it should take to this most fundamental area of industrial reform. In transport reform, including the waterfront and coastal shipping, examples which stand out in lights have been ignored by the Government for a very long time. It costs more to ship from Tasmania to the mainland than to ship the same amount from Tasmania to Rotterdam. Trans-Tasman shipping costs are excessive and even small ports like Cairns carry massive overheads due to high labour costs which have lost for them trade with Papua New Guinea and the Pacific islands. </PARA>
<PARA> We have put forward a comprehensive package of privatisation measures-an area which the Government still seems incapable of addressing. We have talked about reform of the taxation system, including the adoption of a goods and services tax, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and substantial cuts in personal income tax. We know that is what the Treasurer wants because it is what he told us about a few years ago at the time of the summit. </PARA>
<PARA> But such a radical change is not acceptable to this so-called non-conservative Labor Party which has demonstrated in the last few years that it is in fact the most conservative political force in Australia today at the very time when this nation needs change and some radical approaches to the fundamental problems before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The considerable falls in average disposable incomes have not been offset by a corresponding rise in productivity. This is because the Government, the captive of the trade union movement, has been incapable of tackling the important issue of industrial relations reform. From 1983-84 through to 1988-89 wages have declined by 5 per cent in real terms. Over the period 1985 to 1989 real incomes have fallen by 10 per cent. Yet regrettably we see no corresponding improvement in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has a comprehensive policy of changes to the industrial relations system. This Government has done nothing to increase levels of productivity and therefore to increase our competitive edge in an increasingly competitive world despite the claims of the Treasurer year after year that his Budget would increase productivity and make Australia a more efficient trading nation. Australia has nominal wage growth far higher than that of our international trading competitors. One can only conclude that the reasons for that are the Government's attitude and policies and its total inability to stand up for what it knows to be right in the face of continual pressure from the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of all of this the accord mark 6 is nothing short of a disaster. It links wages to inflation and thus places a floor under inflation at the very time when the Treasurer, falsely, tells us in the Budget-and again will tell us, no doubt-that inflation is going to fall. It is time we asked the Treasurer a simple question: On the basis of your existing policy, how is inflation going to fall? Will it fall by having the entire work force out of work? That may well have an impact on inflation but what will it do to the aggregates of the Budget and anticipated expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA> We must reduce inflation to levels at least comparable with those of our trading partners; otherwise we cannot survive as a trading nation. Our lines of credit are drying up. We are no longer seen as the world's great source of investment. We are seen as a stupid people who have given up the real task of working our way out of our economic and social problems. </PARA>
<PARA> What have Labor's failed economic policies cost? The respected Nomura Research Institute predicts that while Australia's economic output will be 40 per cent larger by the year 2000, a mere 9 1/2 years away, the output of many of our neighbours will have grown by up to 160 per cent during the same period. By the year 2050 Asia less Japan will represent 60 per cent of the world's output. Australia presently occupies the position of the second largest economy after Japan in per capita terms, and third behind Japan and China in actual output terms, in the Asia-Pacific region. Nevertheless, the Nomura forecast is that during those few short years ahead Australia will slip to the fourth position in the regional order, overtaken by South Korea and even challenged by Taiwan and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> When will this downward spiral stop? When will it be reversed? One can only conclude that it will evidently not stop under Labor's policies. It is not good enough to say that relative to past years Australia's performance may be marginally better. When we compare our performance, relative or not, to that of our major trading partners, the sad truth is that we are slipping further and further behind. It is time this Government told the Australian people the truth and time the Government itself faced up to those facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of serious concern is the Institute's conclusion that the average Australian will be worth and produce less than half that of the average Japanese, less than the average Singaporean and equalling Hong Kong in net output. In other words, that tiny little land of Hong Kong, which has nothing but the potential of its people to sell, will in a few short years reach and surpass the total growth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Did the Budget offer any prescription for improvements in Australia's international competitive standing? The answer is a very clear and unequivocal no. With nearly 20 per cent of export earnings required to service the debt we are approaching the recognised danger level of 25 per cent. According to the Business Council of Australia-that reviled institution that I referred to earlier-the debt is feeding on itself. Our service burdens are the third worst in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and our standing in foreign markets has, as I said, already suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> The joke in New York is that Donald Trump must be an Australian because his business, like so many of Australia's entrepreneurs, was based essentially on credit and the expectation of rising inflation to pay for it. What a poor commentary on our economy and our regulatory system of the past years under Labor. I quote again the BCA, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The debt service is already equivalent to $250 per family per month. This burden on all of us is already biting through high interest rates, prices and mounting small business failures. </PARA>
<PARA> With favourable assumptions, simply stabilising our net foreign debt as a proportion of GDP may require shifting as much as 4 per cent of GDP into net export over the next five years. And the job will be harder if Australia's external environment worsens significantly. </PARA>
<PARA>The sad fact is that since the war Australia has never got anywhere near increasing its share of foreign trade by four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly now to the question of social security changes. I would like to examine the changes to the unemployment benefit regime. During the election the coalition announced its proposal to limit unemployment benefits for a period of nine months. We believe that the indefinite receipt of unemployment benefits should never be seen as an adequate alternative to employment. Despite the comments from the Treasurer and from his Ministers that he is not going to be involved in a shabby auction with the Liberal Party, the Government has announced its own new look dole scheme. It has proposed that the current system be replaced by a Jobsearch allowance for those unemployed up to 12 months and a Newstart allowance thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> With the Opposition having led the way on the reform of an outdated and inefficient unemployment benefits system, I must say that any move by the Government to change current practice must be seen as a step in the right direction. However, Labor's scheme involves little more than a name change and fails to set any new direction while our proposal was bold, responsible and would save a further $800m in a year. Labor's pathetic imitation only saves a mere $80m out of a total payment of unemployment benefits of about $4 billion per year which regrettably will probably rise in this Budget period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 I wish to spend a few moments discussing the portfolio area which has a value to the country far greater than the relative percentage allocation in the Budget. I refer to outlays on foreign affairs and trade which amount to some $1,000m of Budget funds or 1.18 per cent of total 1990 outlays of $92,956m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly at present Australia's domestic circumstances have precluded us from spending as much as we would wish in the foreign affairs arena which includes foreign aid, payment for salaries and the operating expenses of our departments overseas-this includes the Department of Trade-grants and contributions to international organisations and outlays on overseas property services provided by the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> Like any good international citizen Australia would wish to be able to give the strongest possible help to those countries that are struggling to keep up with the West. Yet despite the present fiscal constraints the Hawke Government has budgeted for an increase in the 1990-91 outlays on foreign affairs of $117.8m. In real terms that is an increase of 1.1 per cent. The fact is that the Hawke Government has correctly recognised the importance of the strategic role that foreign affairs and trade would play in the important economic development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted that our position on the edge of South East Asia and the Pacific Basin in conjunction with our excellent international reputation have opened up tremendous opportunities for Australia in the rapidly developing world market. Despite its relatively small budgetary allocations in the wider scheme of things the work of the Government in the area of foreign affairs and trade deserves recognition and certainly a good deal of attention.</PARA>
<PARA> Since it came to office in 1983 the Hawke Government recognised that fundamental changes were taking place in the relationships between nations. Although glasnost and its fall-out were still some years away other no less important developments were well on the way. Firstly, eastern Asia was beginning to awaken to the potential in the wake of the transport, communications and technology revolution. Traditionally post-war economic and national relationships were beginning to evaporate. Further, Britain had long since joined the European Economic Community and the old gentlemen's rules of trade were disappearing and Australia had been financially caught by the conservatives' obsession with the resources-led boom. To add insult to injury our old perennially safe export markets had fallen to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor correctly predicted that Australia had to play a new role in the changed circumstances. Internal discipline and restructuring needed to be fostered throughout our economy and externally we needed to establish our bona fides to the emerging nations in our neighbourhood. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the great work that the Hawke Government has done on the domestic front. Of course, not so much has been said about our very impressive economic record internationally. The truth is that under this Government Australia has been playing an active, prominent and highly constructive role in regional and world affairs. We have not only kept pace in the period of extraordinary fast moving and far-reaching change but have been one of the countries helping to set the international agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 7 1/2 years Australia's external policy has been built on a basis of realistic interpretation of our goals and needs. In other words, through realistic assessments of both our national interest and our capacity to advance them for the Government our priorities have clearly existed in our objective of regional and global security, trade and economic policies and good international citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA> Indicative of the Government's understanding of the complementary roles of trade and diplomacy and foreign aid the amalgamation of the departments of foreign affairs and trade has been the catalyst for the success that has come Australia's way in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor the balance between defence policy, foreign affairs and trade policy and other external policy areas have been the subject of close and effective consultation between departments and ministries and clearly articulated ministerial statements. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZG4">Mr GRACE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And committees, as the Minister at the table has suggested. Since 1983 the Hawke Government has been responsible for a number of major multilateral initiatives. Those have included the successful 1989 launch of the Asia-Pacific economic cooperation forum; our policy to bring to an end the Cambodian impasse; the 1986 establishment of the 14 member Cairns Group of Fair Agricultural Trading Nations; our 1989 initiative with France to protect for all time the fragile and unique Antarctic environment; Australia's leadership in the fight for a chemical weapons convention; and the proposal by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) at the twentieth South Pacific Forum in July 1989 for a ban on driftnet fishing in our region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All those initiatives are of major importance and they stand as testimony to the esteem in which our Government is held internationally. Obviously, time precludes me from going to some of the initiatives that I would like to refer to, such as drift net fishing, but I am sure that honourable members will be well aware of its effects on our fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it would be remiss of me to move on without paying tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for his outstanding work in his search for a solution to the Cambodian problem. I hope that all honourable members join with me in congratulating the Minister on the high level of his work which has resulted in the development of a very promising situation. His breakthrough speaks volumes for both the calibre of Australian diplomacy and the strength of our international reputation, and, as I said, the terrific calibre and integrity of the Minister concerned. I believe that what is now occurring in Cambodia should make all Australians very proud. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take this opportunity to say a few words regarding the Cairns group and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round. It is well known that the Government has worked vigorously to achieve an open and fairer world trade system, through the GATT Uruguay Round, for medium-sized trading nations like Australia. Fair and internationally agreed rules for trade are essential to our capacity to export. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that fair competition and access to world markets are crucial to complement our efforts to promote a more efficient domestic industry structure. The Hawke Government's 1986 Cairns group initiative has allowed for the establishment of a powerful third voice, along with the United States and the European Economic Community, in the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time Australia is working to ensure that our interests in other areas, including services, export of natural resources, manufacturing and intellectual property, are all addressed in this Round which is due to conclude in December this year. It is not an overstatement to say that Australia is widely recognised as one of the most constructive and active participants in all areas of the Round. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Labor, a host of bilateral initiatives and achievements have been recorded dealing with matters as diverse as trade and development, peace and disarmament, human rights, and global warming. One of the most important, both economically and strategically, was the December 1989 signing of the Timor Gap zone of cooperation agreement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Indonesian counterpart. This has cleared the way for a joint exploration of the highly prospective and long-contested area which could yield up to two billion barrels of oil or gas. </PARA>
<PARA> This is undoubtedly the most significant agreement and probably the most important development in bilateral relations since Indonesia gained its independence some 40 years ago. It concluded one of the busiest years in the history of Australian-Indonesian relations, a year characterised by sustained diplomacy and practical results, including the restoration of regular, high-level talks between the two countries, the framework for the resolution of longstanding difficulties concerning Indonesian fishermen intruding into Australian waters, and the establishment of the Australia-Indonesia Institute for further people-to-people contact. </PARA>
<PARA> Another landmark bilateral agreement has been the review of the operations of the closer economic relations agreement, which took place between Australia's former Minister for Trade Negotiations and his New Zealand counterpart in August 1988. This has allowed for continued improved access to markets across the Tasman in a wider range of primary, manufacturing and service industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, in its approach to foreign affairs the Hawke Government has taken the time to reinforce two of our strongest relationships outside New Zealand. This has involved the United States and Papua New Guinea. The Government ushered in a new, more genuinely post-colonial bilateral relationship with New Guinea with the conclusion of the joint declaration of principles in December 1987. The declaration has put in place a new and total framework for relations and the initiation of regular, high-level, wide-ranging consultations with Papua New Guinea at ministerial level. </PARA>
<PARA> In its dealings with the United States, particularly through ANZUS, Labor has stressed the point that a partnership exists, not the big brother-little brother relationship which was so eagerly pursued by the previous Government. Our new and equal partnership status has struck a responsive chord in the Americans who, through our now permanent ministerial trade talks, have been prepared to give ground on matters of dispute. A good example of this process at work existed at the October 1989 talks, where the Australian Minister for Trade Negotiations was able to double our access to the US steel market. Likewise, Australia has also succeeded in securing changes to the US draft farm and trade Bills, thus protecting our farming and commercial interests both in the US and in third country markets. In the general area of world citizenship, Australia has built up an excellent reputation as a country which stands behind its principles. </PARA>
<PARA> In the now hotly debated arena of environmental damage, Australia has shown itself to be in the forefront of those countries that are prepared to stand up and be counted. In March 1989 our Foreign Minister, on behalf of the Prime Minister, signed the historic declaration of the Hague on the protection of the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia further established its international credentials at the South Pacific Forum in July 1989 with the Prime Minister's announcement of a major Pacific based study of climate warming and its impact on sea levels. Likewise, in the area of peace and disarmament the Hawke Government has earned a reputation as a nation of principle. We have had a reputation as a vigorous and respected promoter of arms control at the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and elsewhere. We have created the full time position of Ambassador for Disarmament, vigorously opposed French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and played a key role in the creation of a nuclear free zone in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has remained a strong proponent of the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty to ban all nuclear testing. We have proposed the establishment of a fully operational global seismic network to monitor such a ban and have upgraded Australia's seismic monitoring facilities accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Our last, but major, area of achievement which I believe I should refer to relates to the Government's efforts on behalf of human rights. Multilaterally, we have been active in the United Nations in the negotiation of new international instruments to cover the rights of the child, the rights of human rights defenders and the rights of migrant workers. In terms of bilateral human rights representations, Australia raises more individual cases than probably any other country in the world. In the 12 months to May 1989, for example, Australia raised more than 400 cases with 68 different countries, covering both the plight of particular individuals and situations of widespread and systematic abuse. That is a record of human rights support of which we can really be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> Since March 1983 foreign affairs has undergone a chameleon-like change under the direction of the Hawke Government. We now have an international policy which accurately reflects our three main priorities: our social concerns; our economic priorities; and our regard for fair play, social awareness and the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to escape the conclusion that, on the results being achieved at the present time, and which I have now presented to the House, our budgetary allocation to foreign affairs and trade is indeed money well spent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, in speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, may I say that within the Australian community there is a sense of frustration and bitter disappointment with the Budget that was presented just a few short weeks ago by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). I think it is fair to say that the Budget has been described as half a Budget, the Budget that you have when you are not having a Budget and when you are not having a depression. It has also been described as a `steady as you sink' Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real result of the document that the Treasurer handed down those few weeks ago is a sense of frustration in the community. There is a sense of frustration that the Government has lost touch with what is happening out there in the real world. There is a feeling that the Government has lost touch with the little people of Australia and that, indeed, there is very little hope for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am absolutely delighted to see the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) seated at the table today. I am sure that he is certainly aware of what is happening in our particular part of the world. The Minister and I share one of the fastest growing areas of Australia as part of our adjoining electorates. I refer in particular to Logan City. </PARA>
<PARA> Logan City is now the second biggest city in Queensland and the ninth biggest city in Australia. It has another distinction. Logan City has more than 4,800 small businesses scattered throughout its length and breadth, many of them in the Minister's electorate. In recent weeks in Logan City there have been scenes of very great tragedy as small business after small business have gone to the wall and more and more people have lost their jobs. The number of unemployed in the south side of Brisbane has increased by some 20 per cent. The failure rate in the small business area is usually between 10 and 15 per cent per annum, but in Logan City it has now reached 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not fly-by-night businesses. They are established businesses, some of which have been in existence for more than 20 years. Because of the Government's tough monetary policy they are now facing extinction. It is a tragedy that at the moment we are seeing Australia's biggest sector of employers-small business-facing unbelievable hardships in the name of Government monetary policy and in the interests of trying to get the banks back onto the straight and narrow. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the real tragedies of the large corporate collapses in Australia is that it is now the small business community that would appear to be picking up the tab. I am horrified by the number of small businesses in Logan City which have been forced to the wall by banks claiming really quite small amounts of money to keep their ships afloat, with very little regard for what is happening there and what is happening for the employment prospects of those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Budget was deficient in several aspects. In this House today the Opposition has been able to expose some of those deficiencies. I have no doubt that the Treasurer, in fact, was looking towards a major privatisation program as part of his Budget strategy to try to get things back on the ropes. Perhaps we will not see the full effect of this year's Budget until after next Monday's meeting of the Australian Labor Party federal body at which the future of privatisation in Australia will be discussed. In so many areas we must act quickly and sensibly. The time has come to get rid of some of those ideological hang-ups and to get out there into the real world and make things happen for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my responsibility to look after my shadow portfolio areas of tourism and aviation in relation to the 1990-91 Budget. There is no worse reflection on the attitude of the Government towards Australian industry than that which we saw during the presentation of the Budget. In his Budget speech to the House, the Treasurer said not one word about tourism. There was very little said in terms of aviation. Yet, these are two of the most vital industries in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make those statements lightly. The plain fact is that tourism is now this country's biggest export earner. Last year tourism earned $6.1 billion for Australia. It is Australia's biggest private sector employer, with more than 500,000 people employed in the tourism and hospitality industry. There was not a word about that particular industry in the Budget. In fact, one had to plough through the Budget Papers to learn that the total allocation of funds of the Federal Government to the tourist industry this year was $40m.</PARA>
<PARA> A major campaign was recently conducted by industry groups, including one that was headed by a former Minister, who said that the Government should be heading towards $100m as the budget for promoting Australian tourism overseas to help in the recovery program. In actual fact, the allocation that was given this year is exactly the same as was given for the past two years. That takes into account the fact that special allocations were made last year to try to help in the recovery of the Australian tourist industry after the disastrous airline dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that $40m is a small sum. I say also that it is about time the Government, during its two remaining years in office, looked towards restructuring the tourism industry. If we consider the total allocation by the Government to the tourist industry, I think it will be obvious that there is very little commitment to that restructuring. I refer in particular to the departure tax that is imposed on every traveller who leaves Australia to go overseas, whether they be Australian nationals or international visitors. In 1978, when the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism recommended the introduction of the departure tax to help fund the promotion of Australian tourism overseas, there was a great hue and cry from the industry, but when it was all boiled down, the industry decided that it was not a bad idea. Last year the departure tax in Australia reaped for the Government $38m. The total allocation to the Australian Tourist Commission last year was $40m. I suppose it is drawing a long bow, but one could almost come to the conclusion that the commitment of this Government to tourism in a personal sense was $2m. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this year the Australian Tourist Commission will have a very tight time indeed maintaining its promotional efforts overseas. Anyone who comes into this place and says that the tourist industry is still not feeling the full effects of last year's airline dispute really does not know what he or she is talking about.</PARA>
<PARA> I concede that in terms of the numbers of international visitors from places such as Japan and other areas of Asia, there has been quite a substantial increase. But the fact is that the business from North America that was so vital to Australia is down. The business from Europe is down. In fact, we are finding it very difficult indeed to attract Australians to travel in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the current figures, really the only State that has had any sort of major recovery has been Tasmania. The big losers in terms of the domestic tourism market have been north Queensland, the centre of Australia, and very much Western Australia. I am delighted to see the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in the House today because I know that his electorate covers so much of that area of north-western Australia which is really feeling the pinch of what has happened in the last 12 months. In the town of Broome, the four major tourism resorts there are now all in liquidation because the tourists are just not going there. In fact, only one resort is managing to keep its head above water, and then only because of very substantial cash reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> So, the Government has a very real job to make sure that the promotion of Australian tourism does get under way once again. Last week the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) announced the second phase of the domestic tourism recovery program. The total sum that was allocated to that domestic tourism recovery program was $50,000. To its credit, last year the Government provided $11m for the revitalisation of tourism. After some very funny things that went on in terms of awarding a contract to an advertising agency, a major campaign headed by Johnny Farnham burst forth on the television screens of Australia. That $11m worth of advertising resulted in a take-up of 11,000 phone-in inquiries. A response of 11,000 inquiries at a cost of $11m would have to make this the most expensive advertising campaign in the history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not to say that the principle of the domestic advertising campaign was not right. We needed that campaign to try to get people to travel again. As well, other factors came into play. The advertising campaign was not all that it could have been, but there needs to be a greater confidence in the Australian community about travelling again, especially in light of what happened with the airline pilots dispute. We still have a very great way to go indeed before we get Australians travelling around the country again. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I say though that there is one thing on the horizon that does give us some hope, and that is the introduction of the deregulation processes into the domestic airline scene come 1 November this year. Many people in the tourist industry are putting a great deal of faith in what is going to happen there. I too rather hope that we will see a major expansion of domestic tourism following the introduction of deregulation. We have certainly got a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> It never ceases to amaze me that only 8 1/2 per cent of Australians use our domestic airlines system; that only 16 per cent of Australians have ever been on an aeroplane. The principal reason for this is that it costs too much. Now there is an opportunity for people to travel and we would hope that, in the competition that follows from deregulation on 1 November, there will be more value going back into that market. What gives me hope is what has happened in the United States of America. In 1978, when deregulation was first introduced, only 20 per cent of Americans actually used the airlines system there. The figure in 1988 had risen to 68 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia there is a huge potential market out there waiting to be tapped, a market of people who could be described as `have-not'-have not had the opportunity to be able to travel on Australia's airlines, have not had the money to be able to afford to travel on Australian airlines. I guess in the newspapers at the moment we are seeing the introduction of what may happen once deregulation comes in, with fare discounts of up to 50 per cent and with the opportunity of travelling at all hours of the day and night at discounted rates. We hope for the sake of tourism that that will help. </PARA>
<PARA> It was interesting that the Industries Assistance Commission report on travel and tourism cited a couple of things that were major inhibitors to the growth of tourism in Australia. Those two things were the high cost for international visitors coming to Australia and the high cost of getting around Australia once they had arrived. There was another factor and that was the lack of seats on certain routes at certain times of the year. I guess the Government has got half of it right: that when we enter into deregulation it is going to be cheaper for people to travel around Australia once deregulation comes in. </PARA>
<PARA> Can I also say that, in terms of the promotion overseas of Australia by the Australian Tourist Commission, I think most of us were terribly disappointed when we learned that the principal amount of money would have to be put into the Japanese market and that funding would be withdrawn from North America and from Europe in particular. The Japanese market really is quite incredible in the contribution it makes to Australian society, and I am certainly not one of those people who would ever make any criticism of the fact that we are pinpointing that particular market. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several interesting things about the Japanese. Last year 349,500 Japanese visited Australia, and that figure is rising all the time. They stay in Australia for nine nights. Some 83 per cent of them are pure tourists inasmuch as they use our infrastructure. The interesting thing is the amount of money that they spend: in Queensland, upwards of $227 per head per day. They are our biggest spenders, but the point is that the tourism market is a very fickle market. We have to be very careful indeed that, if we find that there is too much criticism of the Japanese tourist market, we could well have a situation whereby some of those operators that are in Japan at the moment might look elsewhere to escape the criticism of sending so many people here. It is not wise to put all of our eggs into the one market; we should be looking at spreading our promotional efforts. I guess that on $40m that is very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would urge the Minister for Tourism to have a look at what he can do in terms of restructuring the funding arrangements for the Australian Tourist Commission. I think he should look seriously at what happens with the departure tax. He should look seriously at an integrated program from the industry itself to make even greater contributions than it does already to the promotion of Australia overseas. At the moment about 20 or 24 per cent of the total funds that are spent overseas promoting Australia come in one sense or another from the industry itself. Maybe over this next decade we have to look more and more to the industry taking over that marketing effort. But something has to be done because we just cannot afford to let the efforts made so far in building Australia as a major tourism destination fall by the wayside. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that was not evident in the Budget Papers was what exactly was going to happen in terms of international aviation. I mentioned a little earlier in my speech the situation that existed in privatisation or lack of it, inasmuch as the debate is going on towards next Monday with no-one really knowing what is going to happen in that respect. In a speech earlier today I mentioned some of the disadvantages that Qantas had by not being able to compete in some of those markets because of its present structuring. It worries me when we see the state that Qantas has itself in at the moment, and I think everyone should be concerned with what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> We mentioned earlier the amount of funding that Qantas needed to get back on the rails again. What we failed to mention was the fact that Qantas, even though it is operating reasonably full aircraft at the moment, is coming closer and closer to catastrophe. For example, at the moment on the Kangaroo route between Australia and London, Qantas has to operate at a 78 per cent load capacity to be able to break even. So every aircraft that operates between Australia and London has to have 78 per cent of its seats taken by paying passengers just to break even. </PARA>
<PARA> The most profitable route for Qantas in recent years has been the Japan-Australia run. What is happening there? Twelve months ago Qantas needed to sell only 55 per cent of its seats on those planes to make a profit. Already in the last 12 months this has blown out to 66 per cent. It must be a real concern for Australian tourism because while we have figures like that emerging all the time Qantas has no prospect of being able to get into a competitive mode to compete with what is happening with the megacarriers. Indeed, on many of the routes coming into Australia the megacarriers will be knocking Qantas out of that run more and more because they do have the flexibility and the financial clout to be able to provide that real competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I would urge the Government to move towards a total privatisation of Qantas as soon as it possibly can, otherwise we may be in trouble. What worries me is that, within that same Industries Assistance Commission report, it was urging the freeing up of Qantas because it thought that if the market was open to competition we would probably see a 25 to 27 per cent reduction in the price of international air fares coming into Australia. So that has to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> While the IAC report contained a sense of urgency in terms of loosening up the Australian market, really the Government has done very little to do it and, in actual fact, there seems to be an attitude abroad now in certain sections of the Department of Shipping and Aviation Support and, indeed, Qantas that we should put up the shutters again and try to provide a more and more protectionist policy for Qantas so that it can exist in the short term. That is not the way to run our airline and that is not the way to run Australian tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must have now is a vital international air regime that will allow people to come into Australia as cheaply and as efficiently as possible. We have to do that because, if for no other reason, in tourism we have the only industry in Australia that has the capacity to provide long term employment for our young people. I have quoted this figure many times in the House before and I will quote it again. It is the figure that was given by the old Bureau of Industry Economics some years ago now as to the effect on employment of international tourism to Australia. The figures that are worth repeating over and over again are simply these: that every time we have a net increase of 25,000 in the number of international visitors coming into our country we create another 1,400 jobs-particularly jobs in the skilled and semi-skilled area and particularly jobs for females. We have to get that employment there because the fact is that there is no other industry in Australia that has that sort of potential to provide mass employment. We must make sure that there are no inhibiting factors in terms of artificial barriers for international visitors coming here and, indeed, that there are no artificial inhibitors in letting Australians see their own country. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat once again: tourism is our biggest export earner, our biggest earner of hard currency, our biggest private sector employer, and yet in these Budget Papers the Government has done nothing in a real sense to try to increase the numbers that are coming in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I want to range over quite a few issues. As Mark Antony once observed, the good that men do is oft interred with their bones, but the evil lives after them. It is the evil which I will be paying attention to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the greatest problem in this country-and it is one which is not recognised generally, certainly not by many politicians-is that we have a growing dichotomy between city and country people. We as a nation are growing apart, and I am afraid that this Budget, if anything, makes that position worse. I will get to that in a minute. If this problem is not tackled, it is going to destroy this country far more surely than the current account deficit or any of those problems that are put forward here. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess there are a number of historical reasons for that dichotomy, although it is true to say that Australia has always been the most urban country in the world, even 100 years ago. But there was a fellow feeling in those days between city and country, a feeling that each depended on the other. That has gone and has largely been replaced by massive ignorance. I do not believe that in the cities of Australia we find any animosity towards the rural sector or the country in general; it is simply ignorance. The city people do not understand what is happening and do not realise that most of the jobs provided in the cities are actually the product of the wealth that comes from the hinterland of Australia. I might add that the hinterland has not done a good job in selling that idea. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk a lot about being the clever country. I guess it is a noble objective and one we would all like to see achieved, but it seems to me that there is clearly an inequity in the availability of education. If one lives in Sydney or any of the towns scattered around the eastern seaboard of Australia, one can be the richest person in the world and one's kid can walk down the street to high school virtually for no charge; it is virtually free education. If one happens to live in remote Australia-in western New South Wales, or most places through my electorate-one cannot do that. In many cases, a very high cost is involved in sending one's kids to school. I contend that, in the name of equity, it does not matter how rich we are, we should have that ability to send our kids to school at a reasonable, comparative cost, and that ability is just not there. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem was partially tackled by the Whitlam Government when it introduced the non-means tested section of the isolated children's allowance. The allowance was raised in 1984 and again in this Budget, from $900 to $1,500. In real terms, the allowance should probably have been raised to $2,700 to restore it to its 1984 value. I think this would have been money very well spent. Quite clearly, if we are talking about the clever country, at the moment we are saying, `Ah, clever, except in the country areas'. I contend that the country areas need that education as much as anywhere in Australia. I will continue to push for a greater recognition of this need. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is compounded by lowering the means test level at which country people are cut off. The figures are quite ridiculous, because it does not take much of an asset to exceed the value of the means test. If that asset is non-performing and cannot be sold, it seems to me that people are, once again, in double jeopardy. I was very disappointed to see that in the Budget and will be working to make sure that we get a more equitable and rational position in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the economy, I think that the current account is probably our greatest problem. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) had a lot to say on tourism, which is a subject that he certainly knows well. I think that we put far too much store by tourism. It is touted around that tourism is worth $6.1 billion as an export earner. But that is a gross figure, not a net figure. From that we have to deduct all the costs involved in achieving that earning, and those costs are considerable-far more, I would contend, than in many other areas. When we say that it is the biggest export earner, we only achieve that result through a division of the mining industry. If all the mining products in Australia were added together, the net figure would come to considerably more than $6.1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems, therefore, that the way out of the woods for Australia in its financial plight is to do better that which we already do well, and I believe that we have to look very much to this. We are a great country when it comes to mining and rural produce. We have to continue to do those things well and to downstream process our raw materials. If we were to take mineral sands, of which Australia is overwhelmingly the world's biggest supplier, to the first stage of processing, its value would be increased some 10 times; yet every attempt we make to downstream process mineral sands is fraught with all sorts of objections from environmental groups and even government departments, many of whom are becoming imbued with the sort of mentality that seems to pervade the new class that runs the environmental groups in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This area of downstream processing has to be considered very seriously. Although we earn $6.1 billion through tourism, the timber industry saves this country something like $10 billion a year in export replacement. If we did not have the timber industry, we would be importing that much extra. If the industry were allowed to flourish and develop as it should, we could increase that saving considerably. We import $2 billion worth of timber product, and that could easily be produced in Australia or exports could offset any import that does occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I was impressed by the demonstration of the timber industry that took place around Parliament House recently. I pay tribute to the truck drivers and workers in the timber industry who came up here and had the perseverance to stay around for a week. I believe that it was through their efforts that some degree of success was obtained, and not through the efforts of the high fliers in the industry. I was rather appalled on Friday to find that many of those workers were not informed about or thanked by their leadership for what had been achieved through their efforts. I certainly hope that the timber industry remedies that in future because it owes a great deal to those people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the beneficiaries of the achievements of that demonstration will be Harris-Daishowa (Australia) Pty Ltd, who exports woodchips from Australia. I have nothing against exporting woodchips, but I would rather see us exporting pulp and, still better, making paper. I find it rather disturbing that a company like North Broken Hill Holdings Ltd, which has made its best endeavours to establish the industry in Victoria, should find that it cannot get access to the Harris-Daishowa facilities it uses to export woodchips. This Government could and should lean on Harris-Daishowa to make those facilities available. Harris-Daishowa is not and has no intention of going into paper manufacturing in this country. If we exist forever, we will never see Harris-Daishowa making paper here. On the other hand, the intention of North Broken Hill is clearly to make paper, and every effort, pressure and threat ought to be brought to bear on Harris-Daishowa to make it more amenable and willing to work with other people in the industry for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural sector has been a great supporter of Australia. It is true to say that our prosperity was built on the rural sector, of which wool has been a very big component. Wool is in tough times, and I feel that in Australia we now have to support the industry and not back away from it. Some nerve is going to be required, because I believe that it is going to be a long haul to turn around the lack of buying that is occurring at the moment. I believe that governments should be prepared to underwrite and provide support for the wool industry off the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to sustain a wool stockpile when one is paying interest. However, if the Government owned the wool, it would be much easier to sustain that stockpile, especially by the use of on-farm storage whereby storage costs would be zero, or very close to it. I do not see any tangible difference between a government owning bars of gold and owning bales of wool. I would be supportive of any initiative to provide Budget support for the wool industry. That would be in Australia's long-term interest. Nothing could supply the world with a clearer sign of our determination to support the wool industry, which is a great national industry. I believe that faith in that industry would be well and truly repaid. </PARA>
<PARA> Other things must be done. Marketing should be carefully examined. It grieves me that during the wool crisis in about 1971 the talk was that Australia should sell its wool on the North American market. It was pointed out that at that time the United States of America was the biggest per capita consumer of fibre and the lowest per capita consumer of wool. In 1990, the same statistics apply: the United States of America is still the highest per capita consumer of fibre and the lowest per capita consumer of wool. Obviously we have not marketed well in that country. We should also be supporting the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in its endeavours to find new uses for wool and new techniques for wool. Some of these things are being done. Every dollar spent on that type of research is well spent, and funding in that area should be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is smitten with privatisation; it is one of the new buzzwords, along with micro-economic reform. I am cynically amused by the enthusiasm that has developed in this regard. I should say a few words about Telecom. We are told how vital communications will be in the future. Nobody disputes that; clearly communication will be of great importance. But there is not one organisation in Australia that can say honestly that its business has been impeded in any way by Telecom. Any business that alleges that has occurred is talking nonsense; any person who says that is probably a befuddled academic who has never had to operate in the market-place. However, many businesses can say that their operations have been enhanced by Telecom, particularly if those businesses are in the more remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Telecom, which is generally conceded to have provided a world class service, has been able to give that service under the existing regime and could have continued to do so. After all, reductions in prices for telecommunications have little to do with competition but more to do with technological innovation and government demand. Telecom was quite capable of providing the services that this country needed. This debate has raised the subject to an unnecessary level and deflected us from more important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are serious about micro-economic reform, we should be looking at something like lack of the English language in the workplace, which costs this country in excess of $3 billion every year. It adds to the incidence of industrial accidents and reduces safety in the workplace. Those problems could be easily cured if we were prepared to tackle migration and the education system. We fail to tackle this problem; we talk about it but skirt around it. The level of standard English in this country will probably continue to slip, as it has done in recent years. That will be a tragedy for Australia and at great cost to our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I raise is the effect of pressure groups on the economy. Those pressure groups take all kinds of guises. I was appalled to learn today that only about $3.5m is available for grants for industry research and development funding for new materials research. That is an area in which Australia does have some advantage and experience and could do quite well. Yet funding for that research is a mere $3.5m. On the other hand, I noted that in the forward estimates for the Budget about $106m has been allocated for the War Crimes Tribunal, with $18m of that amount for this year. I do not expect all of that funding will be expended. After the first half dozen cases have been run and it is found that it is not possible to get a conviction-and I think the chances of getting convictions are virtually zero-that Tribunal will probably be abandoned. The discrepancies in these type of fundings are an indictment of our values. </PARA>
<PARA> I supported the War Crimes Tribunal legislation because, as was the case with many members of parliament, it was not of direct concern to me at the time, and the pressure of work is such that sometimes one does not notice legislation that slips through. Having looked at the legislation retrospectively, I am appalled by it. I do not know why we ventured down this road or what the Tribunal can do for Australia. I do not understand what it will do for our system of justice. If any person in Australia today who was guilty of a war crime has not suffered enough agony and turmoil in themselves, nothing we can do to them will make any difference. But this legislation will impose an enormous burden or slur on their children, something that the children probably do not deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the passing of time, memories fade and become distorted. It will be virtually impossible to get coherent and accurate evidence. I hope that this legislation can be reviewed, although I do not expect that there will be any convictions under it, certainly none that will stand up to appeals. When that happens the whole thing will be quietly dropped. Certainly that will be a saving for the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that bothers me is the lack of flexibility. People with great ideas in industry have nowhere to take them. It is difficult to do anything because of the interest rates that operate in the market today. Other countries have all sorts of mechanisms in place to assist industries. Recently the Italian economy has overtaken the British economy because of the close cooperation between government and industry. Australia tends to be going the other way, for a variety of reasons. That is a mistake that I hope can be redressed before it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Development Bank is supposed to function to help Australian industry, without necessarily regard to security. It is supposed to back Australians with good ideas. It no longer does that. In any event, if one wants to borrow more than $1m it is difficult to do it from the Commonwealth Development Bank and these days $1m does not go a long way. On the other hand, the Australian Industry Development Corporation is reluctant to lend less than $10m. It is difficult to get money from that source. I would like to think that both of those organisations will be massively refinanced and told to get on with the job they are supposed to be doing, and clearly are not doing. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the privatisation debate. Privatisation should not be an ideological matter. In my view it is not essential to a socialist platform but should be judged very much on its merit. It is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. In some cases it might be the right strategy, but in others it is not. I should not like to have happen here, in our mad rush to privatisation, what has occurred in the United Kingdom, where assets have been sold off and the money squandered on all sorts of intangible things which show no ongoing profit. That would be a dreadful mistake. Any benefits from privatisation should be put back into the economy to benefit industry, so that people will be able to obtain long term jobs. This country needs jobs for its children. Those jobs should be meaningful and well paid. The jobs in the tourist industry depend very much on this approach, because tourism is a discretionary area of expenditure. When the economy is flat people are less likely to travel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 and to follow my friend the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I shall make a few comments on the remarks he has made. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has earned himself an enviable reputation as one who is courageously prepared to call his Party to account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of great distress to me that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie delivered a speech to a press gallery that was all but empty. It strikes me that one of the tragic things about the speeches in this Parliament is that those speeches which are given most courageously, whether from my side of the House or from the Government's side of the House, are all too often given to an empty press gallery. When, in showing even more commitment than it takes to deliver a speech, someone from my side of the House, or, very rarely indeed, from the other side of the House-the only person who fits this category being the honourable member for Kalgoorlie-is prepared to vote against the party line, the press gallery, which ought to applaud that action as democracy being effected, tends more simply to say that the leader of the party is losing control. I regret that the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the remarks of so many speakers concerning this Bill are delivered to an empty gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer (Mr Keating) handed down his 1990-91 Budget it was largely heralded as a non-event. Editorials around Australia said that this Budget had failed to address the essential needs of the community. I would like to quote from the editorial of the Herald of 22 August, the day after the Treasurer's Budget Speech. The Herald headed its editorial with the words, `We are not convinced'. The Herald editor wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Watching Paul Keating deliver his eighth Budget last night it was as though the Treasurer wished he were somewhere else. Not even opulent confidence, conveyed by the knife-edge creases of an expensive suit and natty matching tie and handkerchief, enabled him to argue convincingly his audience should share his optimism for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking was a Treasurer who has had stewardship of that economy for seven years. He argued his policies are working. But the truth is that Australia is still saddled with $124 billion foreign debt of truly banana republic proportions, to borrow Mr Keating's earlier words. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor are there signs that his confidence of being able to stabilise this massive debt are justified: a sharp fall in business investment puts in question the economy's ability to deliver the product growth necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is far from realistic for the Treasurer to expect small business people, whose ranks are steadily dwindling through insolvency induced by the Government's draconian policies, to whoop with joy at the Government's minimal concessions, or to take his outward confidence seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget was a damp squib. </PARA>
<PARA>The Budget failed to address the fundamental needs of the Australian community and has failed to attack head on that which we all fear most-that is, a $124 billion foreign debt which is growing every day. </PARA>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not claim to be an economist and frequently when I am in my electorate people say to me, `But Mr Andrew, what is the Opposition on about? Treasurer Keating tells us that he is not only balancing his books but also handing down a Budget in surplus. Treasurer Keating goes on to allege that that is more than your Party was able to do in its last two Budgets. What are you on about when you are critical?'. I respond with an illustration that I hope serves to convey to people precisely what is wrong with the Australian economy. I say that Australia's economy is just like the farm and, currently, if one were to call that farm `Australia' and if my desktop were to be that farm, one can see that there is more coming in the front gate than is going out. There is more coming in, if you like, in seed, lambs for fattening, fertiliser and chemicals than is going out in finished product. There is more coming in, to the tune of $1.5 billion every month. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer says that he is handing down a balanced Budget, it is like the farm housewife-no sexism intended, Mr Deputy Speaker-taking the household budget of the farm and saying, `I am going to balance the household books'. Of course, she can do that because all she needs to do-as the Treasurer does-is charge enough rent to everyone who lives in the house to ensure that the household books are balanced while the farm continues to go broke. That is what is happening in Australia. The Treasurer is managing to balance his books. So what? The nation for which we are all accountable and responsible continues to go deeper into debt. The reason that the Opposition is indignant about this Budget is that we see nothing in it that addresses the fundamental problem that the nation faces-the problem of going deeper and deeper into debt. Balancing Treasurer Keating's books is only tinkering at the edges. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us keep in perspective what this foreign debt-this debt in our balance of trade-is all about. In the Adelaide Advertiser and in the South Australian press generally there was a great hue and cry when it was reported that an alleged $700,000 was being spent in the parliamentary dining room on dining room modifications. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I have been in the dining room and I find it hard to see where that sort of money has been spent. Frankly, I am just a little sceptical about that figure. But it does not matter for the purpose of this debate. If the money was spent, there can be no justification for it. But let us keep it in perspective. The amount of $700,000 is only the amount of money for which the nation will go into debt while I am delivering this speech-$700,000 every 20 minutes. The nation will go into debt to the tune of $2m an hour, $50m a day, $500m every 10 days, and $1.5 billion a month. It is unbelievable stuff, but that is what is happening, and the Budget that was handed down in this chamber did nothing to turn that situation around. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Opposition is less than enchanted with that Budget. It failed to address the real needs of the Australian community. Our criticism of the Budget is that it did nothing at a time when something needed to be done. If one is an Australian taxpayer, in spite of all that the Treasurer tells us about what he has done for us, the truth is that one continues to pay tax at an exorbitant rate. The Treasurer will say-and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, may even say it-that the tax rate has fallen.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the reality is that when you and I came into this Parliament in 1983-84, 72 per cent of Australian taxpayers paid tax at a rate of 30 per cent or less. Last year only 48 per cent of Australian taxpayers paid tax at a rate of 30 per cent or less, or, if I put it around the other way, in reality, 28 per cent of taxpayers once had an income tax rate of over 30 per cent, and today 52 per cent of taxpayers have an income tax rate of over 30 per cent. Nothing in this Budget and nothing in the action taken by this Government over the last seven years have encouraged Australians to be more productive and unless we are more productive we will not have coming out of the front gate more than is currently going into it. </PARA>
<PARA> I represent an electorate largely made up of rural producers. Rural producers have good reason to be indignant at the action taken against them in this Budget. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, as I have said, has already courageously referred to it. In this Budget the Treasurer had the sheer, bare-faced audacity to pretend that he was offering farmers tax deductibility for fencing in order to prevent land degradation. That is great motherhood stuff in 1990 when simply to utter the word `conservation' wins everybody on side. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on closer inspection what did we discover? We discovered that tax deductibility for fencing for farmers to minimise land degradation was granted only if a farm already had in place or was putting in place a whole farm plan. That might seem fair enough superficially, but I have been told by the South Australian Department of Agriculture that it has been caught on the hop; that it is not ready either to put in place or to approve whole farm conservation plans. Further, the technical and further education colleges in South Australia say that the setting up of appropriate courses to ensure that farmers know how to go about a whole farm plan will take up to five years. </PARA>
<PARA> Would it really have mattered if the Treasurer had simply allowed tax deductibility for fencing for conservation? Does he not believe that every individual farmer is capable of making his own responsible fencing decisions? For crying out loud, Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know a farmer who fences for fun? They choose to put fences only when the fences are going to keep the planted trees free from what would otherwise be invading stock. </PARA>
<PARA> A technique was once introduced, I am pleased to say by the Liberal and National parties, that allowed tax deduction at an accelerated rate for water conveyancing. Nothing did as much to sort out the indiscriminate use of water irrigation as did that provision, and this lot rubbed it out. Now they are prepared to introduce tax deduction for fencing of some form to minimise land degradation but only if the criteria the Government has laid down have been met. </PARA>
<PARA> What Australia needs is a measure that says we trust people to get on with appropriate water conveyancing and appropriate minimisation of soil degradation. We need conservation measures, not conservation thwarted by a heavy-handed government. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is only dealing with the edges of the major problems that Australia's rural producers face as a result of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I could not believe my ears when the Treasurer stood up and said that he was imposing an assets test on the family allowance. I share all of the indignation of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie: with an assets test for the family allowance set at $300,000, there would scarcely be a farmer in Australia who would qualify for the allowance. It is totally indefensible and totally discriminatory. I venture to suggest that even the South Africans would hesitate at this sort of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter what the cash flow is. It does not matter how large a family is. If the assets exceed $300,000, the family no longer gets the family allowance. It does not matter what it earns. If Australia's rural producers saw their rural assets as being worth in money terms half a million dollars, and if that was all it meant to them, they would have liquidated them. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know that they see their asset as something that has been in the family for generations or as something they have acquired by going without. They do not see it in simple capital terms. </PARA>
<PARA> This year of all years, when we know that grain prices are falling dramatically, when wool is proving to be a major burden in terms of the way we move it through the market, and when even the fall in the floor price, which the Opposition supported, has not been successful in generating farm incomes-this year when farmers face the reality that in all probability they will have negative incomes-there will be no family allowance. How can anyone-I invite the next honourable member to speak to tell me-defend a policy as discriminatory as that?</PARA>
<PARA> There is no question about whether a family actually deserves the family allowance. Simply having in one's name a non-productive asset worth over $300,000 means one can kiss the allowance goodbye and with it the capacity to budget for a portion of one's family's needs. If that was not enough-I am reluctant to proceed with this litany of dire predictions-what else do we have? We have the assets test on Austudy tightened closer. Anyone who has a farm or business valued at over $400,000 no longer gets Austudy. A Government that declares that what it wants is a clever country is saying to rural young people in a year when rural incomes will be at a low unprecedented for three decades, `You will not get Austudy.'</PARA>
<PARA> A child from a country farm is no longer able to have the access to Austudy that the urban counterpart might reasonably enjoy. Worse than that: a child from a country farm is very likely the person this Government needs because that person is most likely to be innovative, most likely to show some capacity to get on with the job. Yet this Government says that there will be no Austudy and, consequently, in 1990-91 no tertiary education for such children. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish I could finish there but we have the additional burden of the Government saying to farmers that that is not enough, that it will make sure that the export inspection charge, of which it currently recoups 60 per cent of the cost, will be totally borne by farmers as from 1 January next year. The farmer, who already faces negative income, will now have to bear, of all things, the total cost of exporting-the very capacity to generate product that the Government needs in order to get more out of the gate and less in. </PARA>
<PARA> My farmers have in some cases been prepared to say, `We could tolerate that-not like it, not welcome it but tolerate it-if in this user-pays technique we had some say in the way the export inspection is conducted'. But no, the Government says how it will be done and farmers foot the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If I speak beyond my 20 minutes, the $700,000 of debt that I referred to earlier in my speech will be exceeded and I have much else to say about the way in which the Government has dealt with pensioners and about the uncertainty that has been generated for all pensioners who now find themselves uneasy about what they do with anything in excess of $2,000 that they might invest. They now find themselves uneasy and uncertain about the Government's pharmaceutical benefits scheme because it had been announced and then suddenly changed. Pensioners-the very people who made this nation what it is-are plagued with uncertainty because of the actions of the Government and are treated as if they were major players in the money market. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on but instead I would like to ask: is it not really a tragedy that in spite of the increased tax take that has characterised all of the Treasurer's Budgets, the infrastructure in Australia continues to run down? I conclude by adding that there is another way to go about addressing Australia's major problems, and this other way has been endorsed by the Opposition, when through the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) we have indicated what we will do in industrial relations; through the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) we have been bold in our statements about a broad-based consumption tax; and through the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) we have indicated what we would do in industry protection. It is time the people of Australia had an opportunity to change the Government. We cannot afford to go on marking time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address my initial remarks today to some of the matters that were raised in the latter stages of the debate on the social welfare legislation. The changes were being discussed the other night and some honourable members opposite levelled criticism at people in our society, including some members of parliament, who choose to access the public health system, even though they are earning reasonable salaries or wages. I say to those honourable members opposite and others who may share their view, that if we confine the public health system to the poor, we condemn them to a poor public health system. All the crocodile tears in the world will not alter that fact. I am sure that if we got to that stage, many honourable members opposite would shed crocodile tears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may have conveniently slipped the memories of those honourable members that the poor and the less well-off in this country-and in New Zealand, where I originally came from-are not asked to pay anything towards the cost of maintaining Medicare or the public health system which they are able to access free of charge. That is the way it should be; that is the way it will continue to be under a Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government believes in the ability to pay principle, embodied in the phrase, `From each according to his or her means, to each according to his or her needs'. This is a basic tenet of our Party and our Government and one which the vast majority of Australians support in a general sense because it is the fair go principle. Who would pay for the upkeep of Medicare and the public health system if the least well-off in our society were the only ones allowed to access it? Are honourable members opposite seriously suggesting that upper and middle income earners would be required to continue to contribute to this system through their taxation, even though they were not permitted to access or utilise it in any way? So much for freedom of choice, much vaunted by honourable members on the other side of the House!</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should bear in mind that the proponents of this idea are the very same people who bleat constantly about the fact that they have to contribute to Medicare now, when they can still use it if they want to and when they make claims on their private health funds to assist in paying the accounts of their private doctors, private hospitals and private specialists. The reality is that if we refuse to allow upper and middle income earners to access public health services they will have every expectation that their contribution to that system will no longer be sought through taxation. Where then will the money come from to support and maintain, let alone expand, the public health system? Bingo! There will be no money and the public health system will collapse or limp along on small handouts from the Government in the name of welfare. We do not want a welfare health system. We want a public health system, a uniform health system, a universal health system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition-or those honourable members opposite who claim to have this view-would finally have achieved the objective of many of its members; that is, Australians would be almost totally reliant on the private health system and private health cover once again. We would be back to the bad old days of compulsory private health insurance and no protection for the poor, the aged or the chronically ill. No, thank you! While middle and upper income earners utilise the public hospitals they actually ensure the maintenance of quality services for all patients. The poor and pensioners are seldom in a position to insist on their right to high quality care. How much less able to defend such a position would they be if they were constantly fighting for funding of a system which only they were able to access? It is the old story of the general eating the same food as his troops. How else does one know what sort of food is being served, how else does one judge quality?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite can carry on until they are blue in the face about this matter and never convince me that the withdrawal of non-pensioners or non-low income earners from use of the public health system will improve the service and the efficiency provided to patients. Furthermore, they can sneer all they like about politicians getting privileged treatment. The fact remains that I personally and, I am sure, other members in this House have never sought or received special treatment at a public hospital; nor have my husband and children. I am quite prepared to wait my turn and accept the ministrations of whatever practitioner or specialist is assigned to me. That is the real test of the system. That is the only way that I can be sure, as I am, that the Australian public health system is the best in the world. I can also be sure that my constituents are receiving a satisfactory level of health care through that system. </PARA>
<PARA> To preserve the quality of the system we have it is essential that articulate individuals continue to access it and test its ability to deliver a comprehensive service of high standard. I say again, if we confine the public health system to the poor, we condemn them to a poor public health system. People who do not believe this is true, should remember the days before Medicare and Medibank, when there was no public health system of a universal nature. Women frequently sacrificed their health for the sake of their families' health. If there were a bill to be paid, it would be paid for others in the family and the woman would not take herself to the doctor when she was ill. I do not ever wish to see a return to a system which puts women in that position. At the present time, at least under Medicare, they have an assurance of being able to access any hospital or specialist facility they require and they also have access to bulkbilling from most doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to advise the House that recently in my electorate a rather large medical centre changed its practice and decided to bulkbill, against its previous opinion, because it was losing too much money. I had already explained to many of my constituents that the 85 per cent fee reimbursement from the Government would, in fact, have covered the cost of bad debts or postage or claims to patients for moneys that they owed. That now appears to be the case. This particular medical firm has obviously realised the fact that 85 per cent on a continuing basis and from a regular payer is better than perhaps 75 per cent when it is not quite sure that it is going to get it. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had the strange situation with this particular medical centre where if a patient went along before 8 o'clock in the morning-for want of a better time; more probably 8.30-when the computer was not switched on, he would be treated as a bulkbill patient, but once the computer was switched on the family income was looked into by the doctor to see whether it was appropriate to bulkbill. I have a very firm view on this. Just as a doctor likes to keep his patient's business private and between him and his patient, so the patient should have the right to keep his financial status between him and his accountant or him and his bank manager. The patient ought not to have to disclose his financial position to his doctor in order to receive bulkbilling treatment. I am very pleased to see that medical centre adopt bulkbilling, because a lot of constituents in my area were actually accessing the service it provided but complaining because they were unable to get bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA> As many members of this House would be aware, there will be a review of the health needs of the Australian people over the next 18 months or so. It will take quite a while to do. I am sure that people will have an opportunity to put to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) their views on the current system. I think that is a good thing. I do not think that anyone here would see it as anything else, but basically it must always be an underwrite of the Medicare system, which is such a good system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which our Government is determined to achieve improvement is the area of social infrastructure provision in outer metropolitan areas. I represent an outer metropolitan area and I know that the people in my area have lots of difficulties with transport, housing and access to services. Often it does not appear as if these people have a problem because they have one car and seem to be reasonably affluent from the outside, but they have great difficulty in using the public transport system because it basically travels north and south in the Cowan area and we need more comprehensive east-west systems for people to be able to access essential services when their one car is being used. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, I note the commitment to family resource centres and the $15m which the Government intends to provide in this area over the next three years. In Western Australia, the State Government has made a noteworthy commitment to establish family centres in a number of suburbs throughout the Perth metropolitan area, and quite a few are being developed in my electorate of Cowan. These centres provide an excellent community facility which has the capability of growing and changing with the community's needs. The State Government puts in the entire capital cost of that facility and the community committee which administers the centre actually determines all other use of it, except for a program for four-year-old education. As some honourable members would be aware, children do not attend compulsory schooling in Western Australia until age six, so quite a number of children are seeking alternative activities, educational activities at that, and so the State Government has made an undertaking to assist in this area through the family centres. Through the provision of those centres they now are able to extend four-year-old programs for young children awaiting attendance at school. </PARA>
<PARA> As an active member of the interim management committee of the Marangaroo family centre, I was delighted to be able to invite the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the opening ceremony earlier this year. I know that he was impressed with the quality of the facility as well as the principle which it embodies. The community made him very welcome. Management committees of such centres work extremely hard to ensure the successful delivery of services that their community requires. Depending on the age group of the community around the centre, those services can be very varied. In some areas they may be almost entirely child care or out of school care because of the age of the children and the age of the general population. Demography determines the use of these centres. In other areas, where the population may be a little older, or in this area in years to come, when the population ages, the centres will be used perhaps as autumn centres. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider social infrastructure it is important to ensure that there is flexibility and that we no longer go down the track of having specific-purpose buildings that cannot be changed when the population in the area changes and has different needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to convey my personal congratulations to the members of the management committee of the Marangaroo family centre, with whom I have worked for a considerable period, as well as the members of the management committee of the Kingsley family centre which is also providing an excellent model of active community participation and cooperation in the northern suburbs. The Kingsley family centre has an extremely good relationship with a local primary school and is able to share premises and arrange for the use of the building by school groups at night time. Thus, we end up with a more flexible and appropriate use of all the buildings in the area. This is essential in outer metropolitan areas-and probably inner metropolitan areas, but the populations there perhaps have not yet got around to having to use their resources quite as flexibly as this. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate at this time also to mention the Woodvale family centre, which will be holding its first public meeting at the North Woodvale primary school tomorrow evening under the chairmanship of my State colleague Sam Piantadosi, a member of the Legislative Council. I wish those present at the meeting well in their discussions and consideration of the needs of their local community and I am sorry I will not be able to attend because I think inaugural meetings and public meetings of these family centres are a great learning curve for members of parliament. One is able to ascertain the exact needs of the community when these are expressed in very broad terms at such meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to mention the importance of an aspect of the Budget relating to youth activities. In the portfolio of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) there has been an allocation for activities for young people aged 11 to 16. That is very important. These children will be coming from disadvantaged areas. A particular group in my area will be hoping to access some of this money. I certainly intend supporting their application, if not actually helping them complete it. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context I would like to refer to a fitness centre in my electorate. It went out of business about two years ago when many fitness centres went out of business in Western Australia. Having charged life membership for many people and then run out of money, such centres went broke. For more than two years this centre has been sitting around being gradually vandalised. The local community has been very worried about it but nobody has done anything to overcome the problem. So, in the past 10 months I have been actively involved in trying to ensure that we can resurrect the centre, recommission it or do something to make it a useful community facility. We have now at least got to the stage where there is a possibility of having the swimming pool recommissioned for local use on a commercial basis, with possibly a Skillshare project operating out of one end of the building and a youth activities and drop-in centre at the other. These sorts of things, if generated by members of parliament with other people of goodwill in the community, can make a facility like the former Fletchers fitness centre, which was an eyesore and an area of great concern to the parents in the district, a positive boon to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> This area of Girrawheen to which I am referring is a very disadvantaged area. It has no real community facilities that are easily accessible to the whole population. I hope that we might be able to get some funds to provide some equipment for the centre, which would be very helpful. The group that will be applying for the funds is running a drop-in centre in the area and has a small room on which it pays about $1 a year, or a very nominal rental. But it only has one pool table. Eighty kids come in there. One just cannot operate a facility like that for very long. Whether or not these moneys go to Girrawheen, I am very anxious to see that they go to areas where kids are crying out for something to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to give an illustration. The swimming pool at the Girrawheen health centre, as it was called, or the Fletchers fitness centre has a great dip in the bottom to allow diving. The kids have been using the drained swimming pool as a skateboard rink, for which it is very suitable. In order to enter the building when it was locked up the kids were very creative: they climbed in through the roof and under the doors. We know that these kids want to use the building. Now we just have to make sure that the building will be used properly. I would like to congratulate all of the people involved, including the new owner, George Wuu, who is making every effort to renovate the building and recommission it so that it can be used for the community it is supposed to be serving. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier I briefly discussed women in the community and women's health. This Government is sponsoring a national women's health program. I am sorry to acknowledge that the Western Australian Government has not chosen to participate in that this year but I am confident that we will be able to get it to do so next year, with a bit of luck. Certainly in my area and around my electorate generally there is a great need for proper women's health services in accessible places. Once again we are talking about outer metropolitan suburbs where the transport services are north-south. It is inappropriate to place facilities like women's health centres in situations where people cannot access them by bus-we have no train service yet. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, along with many other people in the community, I am pursuing the establishment of a women's health service which we hope will be a jointly hosted Federal and State facility with family support of all sorts and teenage assistance as well. It will take a bit of time to get it but, as I say, I will ardently lobby the Minister for Health in the State Government in order to ensure that he understands the needs. Hopefully we will get them to join in the national women's health program from July next year. I have no further comments on the Appropriation Bill at this stage, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I thank you for your time and your tolerance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1990 Federal Budget is a great disappointment. In the first Budget following an election one would have expected the new Government to outline a bold period of initiatives for its new term in office. We have not had that program of action to revitalise the nation; we have had a lacklustre Budget which has failed to come to grips with the major economic and social problems confronting our nation. The Budget offers no hope for inflation, no hope for our national debt, no hope for the unemployed, no hope for an end to high interest rates and no hope for any stimulation of investment. Indeed, the theme of the Budget could well be `steady as she sinks'. The Budget lacks vision and hope for the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would not have chosen to make some reforms. He has had something of a change of attitude in recent times and he wanted to include the privatisation of Qantas Airways Ltd, Australian Airlines Ltd, Telecom Australia, the Commonwealth Bank and other government institutions in this particular Budget. The reform package fell off the cart on the way. It was hijacked by the feuding factions and the trade union movement. Ironically, it took the factions only a few days to collapse in the wake of the State Bank of Victoria scandal. Even the Left was prepared to sacrifice its sacred icons to protect its incompetent mates in the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have the humiliating spectacle of the elected government having to go along cap in hand next Monday to seek permission from the trade union movement to introduce the reforms that it believes are right for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years the Treasurer has been introducing his Budgets with glowing promises about J-curves and the nation's emergence from the economic crisis and the Budget that brings home the bacon. This year's Budget makes it clear, if anyone had any doubt, that the glowing descriptions of previous Budgets were an illusion. The fruits of past failed policies are all too apparent in the predictions for this year's Budget. There will be no slowing in the growth in our national debt. Interest rates will remain high and unemployment will grow. </PARA>
<PARA> Just weeks after the presentation of the Budget most observers agree that the Treasurer's bleak picture of the Australian economy in the year ahead was unduly generous. Indeed, the potential of the Iraqi conflict has the capacity to totally destroy the Budget philosophy in just a few weeks. The increasing cost of oil, the cost of Australia's military presence, the loss of trading opportunities and the strengthening of the Australian dollar blow the Budget strategy to pieces. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has acknowledged that farmers should not wear the potentially billion dollars plus cost of trade sanctions against Iraq on their own, there is no provision in the Budget for any compensation package. The Budget documents indicate that unemployment will grow to 7.5 per cent by the June quarter of 1991. But unless there is some significant change in economic policy, some real stimulus to national development, some real encouragement to the productive sector, that figure is likely to be nearer 10 per cent or even higher. </PARA>
<PARA> The nation was looking for leadership, and people are ready for tough decisions so long as they can see that they are part of a real program for economic change. But unfortunately all they got was disillusionment and hurt. Pensioners, students and the unemployed will be sharing in the impact of failed Labor Government economic policies. The Government has resorted to hurting the disadvantaged and those who are least able to protect themselves. Wasteful social engineering programs remain in place but structural reform issues have been avoided. The sick and the infirm will be penalised through new prescription charge arrangements. Almost half a million will be affected by changes to sickness and invalid pensions. The iniquitous assets test has been made tougher and tertiary students will have to repay their education contributions faster. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is spending $4m on public relations campaigns to sell the Budget but even this will not be sufficient to convince the Australian public that it has been well treated. Once again it is the productive sector which has been hardest hit by the Federal Budget's measures. Despite talk of tax cuts, tax collections have once again increased and real expenditure is up. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the nation desperately needs to boost its export income and encourage those producing our national wealth in an effort to come to grips with the crippling debt problem, the Budget includes measures which will actually hamper exports. The amazing decision to increase export inspection charges for primary industries from 60 per cent to a full 100 per cent cost recovery of the export inspection service is the kind of taxation imposition which will further jeopardise our capacity to compete on world markets. Export inspection certificates are required by importers yet Australian exporters must pay. While we as a nation bend over backwards to break down the impediments to products coming into this country, we penalise our own exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the Queensland Grain Grower on 29 August Mr John Spinks of Associated Grain Pty Ltd in Dalby described the Federal Government's cost recovery on agricultural charges as `user pays gone crazy'. He said that the export inspection charges for a 21 tonne container of grain would now rise to $8.57 a tonne. If the container holds a light grain such as sunflower the cost will be nearer $12 a tonne. Mr Spinks said:</PARA>
<PARA>Our margins aren't $12 a ton and we have risks in our trading operations. It also makes us less competitive overseas. We seem to be working more and more for the government. It's not one simple tax-they are all around us. </PARA>
<PARA>In many instances the new export charges will be imposed by the Government even when phytosanitary certificates are not required. While other countries subsidise their producers and encourage their exports, we not only expose our producers to the cold winds of international competition but also tax their every attempt to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall Government expenditure in the rural sector continues to decline and will fall from $445.4m to $423.3m this year and then to $308.9m over the next three years. Included in those figures are significant payments as compensation to the forest industry for not producing. For farmers the bottom line of the Budget is that the rural sector will have to pay $1,369.9m in levies and charges while the Government contributes a mere $423.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest rural sector Government contribution in this Budget is to rural research. The development of the Federal Government's Rural Research Corporation has hijacked control of the industry's levy funds and guaranteed that research priorities are dictated by the academics rather than those who fund the research and are supposed to get its benefits. In fact, one wonders whether this Government's approach to rural research is more aimed at having farmers fund research institutions than achieving improvements to rural productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is invariably keen to promote its initiatives in the area of conservation. In this year's Budget there is a tiny new initiative-100 per cent tax deductibility for fences built to protect land or trees planted as part of a conservation program. However, it seems that very few if any farmers will qualify for this kind of concession, particularly as it is dependent upon the development of a whole farm conservation plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers in the rural sector have a major role to play in the conservation of our national heritage, including the prevention of soil degradation and the protection of forest land. The biggest cause of forest destruction and land degradation around the world is poverty. In many instances the rainforest jungles of Asia and South America are not being cleared for the value of their timber but to establish additional food production areas. Indeed, if those lands were able to appreciate in accord with the economic value of properly managed forests, the people may well be able to be encouraged to develop sustainable forest industries rather than quickly degenerating farm industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the major factor limiting the development of conservation measures on Australian farms is an inability to pay. This Government has adopted a continuing succession of anti-farmer measures which are placing the very economic survival of our rural sector in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent Department of Primary Industries and Energy survey of the farmers of the South Burnett area in my electorate has shown that almost one-third of the farmers in the region are at risk. Most have lost confidence in the future and many are unlikely to survive the continuing impact of the current Government's economic policies. A farmer who is struggling for his very survival cannot spend the time and resources that are necessary to plant trees or maintain conservation programs. He is forced to increase his cropping and stocking program rather than reduce the pressure that he is facing on his land. </PARA>
<PARA> When the banks are screaming for higher and higher Keating-imposed interest rates and when the Government imposes more and more costs and charges a farmer cannot afford to do what he knows is in the best interests of the conservation of his land. The greatest thing that this or any government could do for conservation in this country would be to improve the economic status of the custodians of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian farmers can do more for positive conservation in a day than governments can achieve in a decade. The Government's one billion trees program is just an example. There is an allocation of something like 4c a tree in this year's Budget. Despite all the printed literature and the much publicised ceremonial occasions, the fact is that very few trees have been planted under this program and the Government has now even admitted that it never really intended to plant one billion trees. There are more trees planted by foresters in Australia in a day than the Government is likely to achieve in its one billion trees program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's total disregard for the national road system has been further accentuated in this Budget. Labor's record on roads is deplorable. It sees motorists as mobile tax offices with no rights to any reasonable return for the amounts of taxation they contribute to Government revenue. During the last election campaign the Government was shamed into some small new commitments and so the increase of $160m for roads is a welcome Budget initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the forward projections indicate yet another intention to freeze road funding into the future. Some $1,495m is projected for expenditure in each of the next two years, but that will be followed by a decline of $70m in 1993-94. Labor has clearly not learnt anything from the road funding campaign associated with the last Federal Budget. Labor in Government has slashed road funding by 30 per cent in real terms. Its neglect of our nation's road system is a disgrace. Labor's road neglect contributes significantly to the increase in transport costs, the national road toll, the increase in urban pollution and the isolation of the bush. </PARA>
<PARA> Every dollar spent on roads returns many times as an investment to the nation. One million dollars spent on roads creates 60 jobs and reduces unemployment benefits alone by $400,000. Better roads encourage decentralised industry, increased tourism, lower costs and a more productive society. By the time the national road system is handed back to us following the next Federal election, the extra $1 billion we promised will not be enough. In many cases the damage will be irreversible. By then almost all allocated funds will be required for maintenance purposes without any capability for improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that we have so many Labor State governments is further bad news for the road system. Labor has so slashed road funding in Queensland, even after only one Budget, that some projects have already been stopped. If all that is not enough, we have the Inter-State Commission report on road use charges and that will be more bad news for motorists. Despite the fact that the Inter-State Commission report recommends a new national fuel tax of 20.5c a litre, the report proposes no additional money for roads. The Inter-State Commission report is without doubt a recipe for more bureaucracy, more taxes, and further national decline. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland motorists will be the big losers under the Inter-State Commission report. The years of the National Party Government have protected Queensland from the insidious fuel taxes that apply in other States. The Goss Labor Government is already showing signs that it intends to use the Inter-State Commission report to get around its election promise not to introduce a State fuel tax. In its submission to the Inter-State Commission, the Queensland State Government has implied support for the basic thrust of the report and restricted its criticisms to aspects of the administration arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals to impose up-front charges of around $18,500 on semi-trailers will have a cruel impact on all regional and rural Australians. These kinds of cost impositions will not only bankrupt transport operators but guarantee price increases on every item in every store. It is inconceivable that any Queensland government could embrace proposals which so clearly disadvantage the motorists of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Hidden away in the fine print in the Budget is the Government's long-awaited response to the review of the aerodrome local ownership plan (ALOP), and unfortunately it is more bad news. The Commonwealth Government has announced its intention to terminate the program altogether. Over 270 airports in rural and provincial areas of Australia now operate under this program which provides a 50 per cent Federal government contribution towards aerodrome capital and maintenance costs. In ending the ALOP this Government is breaking agreements made over a period of more than 20 years with local governments which took over the ownership of local airports with a promise from the Federal government of the day that it would continue the 50 per cent share of costs into the future. Many of those agreements are in writing, but it seems that past contractual responsibilities carry no weight with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is happy to collect massive taxation from the aviation industry, those who in future will be required to maintain airports outside the major cities will get none of that money. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) in a press release on the Budget night tried to dress up the Government's real intention in a positive way by announcing that:</PARA>
<PARA>for the first time local interests can exploit the commercial potential of their aerodromes to benefit the regions they serve. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>Local communities will be invited to take over the management and operation of their aerodromes. </PARA>
<PARA>But surely even the Government knows that the vast majority of these airports have no capacity for exploitation or even to cover their own costs. The Government's real intention is perhaps better revealed towards the end of the press release where Senator Collins says:</PARA>
<PARA>For those ALOP aerodromes where the offer is not accepted by local owners, the Commonwealth will consider ceasing funding support. </PARA>
<PARA>Local communities are in a no-win situation. If they do not accept the full cost of maintaining and caring for their airports, the Government will stop funding anyhow. The Federal Government is shifting the multi-million dollar airport maintenance responsibility on to the ratepayers of rural and provincial Australia. Those who have waited patiently for airport upgrading will get nothing from this Government. The Government left it to the First Assistant Secretary of Transport, Mr David Buckingham, to explain its abdication of responsibility for aerodromes at the recent conference of the Australian Airport Owners Association at Port Augusta. Mr Buckingham said that the Government would consider making one-off social benefit subsidies to ALOP aerodromes which are not assessed to be commercially viable. The subsidy is to be paid in the form of a once only capital grant from which future maintenance and operational costs are to be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Aerodromes under the ALOP program fill an essential local need. They are vital links in the chain of communication between rural and provincial areas and the rest of the world. Airports are not just useful when Snowdon Airlines wants to travel to the Tennant Creek dog show or visit the Collingwood football match. They are required for basic communications with the rest of the world, particularly in times of emergency or sudden calamity. Very few of these airports have any potential to actually pay their own way. Some have so few daily movements that it is impractical to collect landing charges. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government really intended to provide appropriate funds for maintenance annuities for all the non-commercial airports currently under the ALOP program, the Budget should be foreshadowing allocations of several million dollars. However, total forward estimates for this purpose in the Budget is only $18.6m. Clearly, very few, if any, of these airports can expect any future contribution from the Federal Government. Indeed, the Federal Government is totally abdicating its responsibility towards rural and provincial airports and placing their owners in a cruel vice. The local people will allow their airports to close eventually when they cannot afford to meet the maintenance demands of the Government's Civil Aviation Authority or when additional burdens are imposed on ratepayers whom, I might add, copped plenty of beatings in this Federal Budget with further cutbacks projected for local government funding in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget decision to tighten the assets test is a further cruel blow for those who live in rural areas. Families who are trapped by the assets test will be denied family allowance supplements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had the opportunity to listen to many speeches from those opposite in response to the Budget. I have listened carefully and with some disappointment. I found the contributions that have been made to be both largely disappointing and inconsistent and I would like to pick up a couple of points that were just made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset he expressed some concern for those who are sick and infirm and some regret that the Budget somehow had not properly addressed their legitimate interests. He went on to talk about those who are paying into the higher education contribution scheme, HECS. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth considering the record of honourable members opposite in those two areas. When we talk about the sick and infirm, we know that it was those opposite who went out on the campaign trail and opposed the introduction of Medicare and Medibank. It was those opposite who last year endeavoured to establish a procedure for dismantling Medicare. If we are to put the record in context, we should also record that, ultimately, the Opposition was forced to acknowledge publicly its inability to provide a full and comprehensive health policy. That was, no doubt, one of the events which led to the defeat of the Opposition in the recent election. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite went out on the campaign trail to assist pharmacists to prop up inefficient and unwarranted practices within the pharmacy industry. The very same members tell the House that they have concerns about the sick and infirm when their own practices and policies indicate otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the cake on the question of the higher education contribution scheme. The honourable member for Wide Bay was critical of the fact that the Government has increased the rate at which repayment must be made. The policy of the Opposition is to have no repayments, to have a totally up-front contribution, with no opportunity to pay later. It does not matter whether the rate is 2 per cent, 3 per cent or 8 per cent; the student must pay the money up front, otherwise he or she will not get in the door. The honourable member for Wide Bay criticised the Government because the rate of repayment was changed. The policy of the Opposition does not provide for repayment. The student must pay the money at the start. The inconsistencies of the Opposition are glaring. I propose to make some more comments about that shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the challenge thrown down by the honourable member for Wide Bay to compare the performance of the former National Party Government in Queensland with that of the current Goss Labor Government. I would be quite happy to compare the performance of the former National Party Government with that of just about any other government in the Western world. On most indices, the former National Party Government would be found sorely wanting. I look forward to the opportunity to say more about those comparisons shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Before looking at the specifics of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, I believe it is important to look at some broader aspects of the Budget and the economic framework in which it functions. For the fourth year in succession, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has produced on behalf of the Government a Budget which is not only balanced, but includes a surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> To put that into perspective, tables of Budget outlays and revenue since 1953-54 indicate that no other government has achieved a surplus in the last 37 years, let alone four in succession. This is a major achievement, made all the more significant when it is recognised that the Government now provides a range of services and programs which were not even contemplated in the 1950s and 1960s. Moreover, as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), Government outlays are now at the same level as they were in 1960-61. Together, these measures have reduced pressure on interest rates and thereby provided direct relief to Australian families and business communities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some regret that the banking industry in this country has been slow to pick up the opportunities afforded to it through these policies. I welcome the recent statements of the Treasurer in which he admonished the banks for the way in which they have sought to reap profits from their own errors, the way in which they have sought to isolate their shareholders from their own bad decisions and to force upon decent Australians-home loan borrowers, small business people and large business owners, those who are paying their way-the consequences of their own errors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that the Fraser Liberal-National Party Government, in its term in office, accumulated a Budget deficit of $17 billion. Talk is cheap. Honourable members opposite talk about fiscal responsibility, but the record shows that when they had the opportunity they did not in fact implement those policies. It has, in fact, fallen to the Hawke Labor Government to set the ledger straight; not only to balance the national Budget, but also to put it into surplus. The last Liberal-National Budget presented in this place projected a shortfall of revenue to outlays equal to 2.6 per cent of GDP. In contrast, the Budget before this Parliament today projects surplus revenue over outlays equal to 2 per cent of GDP-some $8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is not only economically responsible; it is targeted to provide services to those most in need. I am delighted that this Budget increases expenditure on education by $921m, or 7.3 per cent in real terms. Funding for schools will receive an additional $248m, an 11.5 per cent increase over the last year. Higher education also benefits from this Budget. The Government's program to increase tertiary places continues, with an extra $24m in the triennial funding program for higher education. By the end of 1993, this Government will have created 70,000 new student places since 1988. By any measure, that is a substantial achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for an extra 1,400 postgraduate research awards is also included in this Budget. I take special pride in that because I place a particularly high value on education in the process of not only providing a fair and equitable society, but also supporting the moves to restructure our economy and provide it with the vitality, enthusiasm and the knowledge that it will require if we are, in fact, to be internationally competitive in an increasingly competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government's commitment to develop Australia as a clever country has received tangible support in this Budget. The cooperative research centres announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the election campaign earlier this year have also been included in this Budget, with an allocation of $4m to assist in the establishment of the first 15 of those cooperative research centres. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal of public comment has focused on the Budget provisions concerning the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and deemed interest on savings of pensioners. Since the Budget was introduced into this House I have spoken to hundreds of pensioners and senior citizens who reside within my electorate of Brisbane. In nearly every case they not only accept but also agree with the main provisions of this Budget when the actual details have been put before them. It is to the shame of some honourable members opposite and certain sections of the media that their incomplete or inaccurate reporting of the Budget has caused deep concern amongst the pensioner community, many of whom are in fact directly assisted by this Budget. However, the rumourmongering and misinformation in relation to changes brought down in the Budget for our elderly have been added to by difficulties imposed on pensioners by other tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has assured pensioners that no-one who presently has a fringe benefits card will lose that entitlement as a result of these changes. In fact, single pensioners with less than $20,800 in savings and no other income will not have their social security entitlements reduced at all. For pensioner couples, that amount is a sizeable $36,000. The Minister has advised that pensioners and beneficiaries who place low yield money in higher yielding investments will achieve a net increase in their disposable income while preserving their Commonwealth Government fringe benefit entitlements and their pensioner health benefit cards. In effect, these pensioners will receive a higher income, made up of interest from their banks and a pension payment from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time the banks started to pay those pensioners a fair return on the deposits they have been taking. For too long, the banks have taken pensioners' life savings, given them no or nominal interest, and then lent that same money at rates between 15 and 22 per cent. The banks have taken unfair advantage of pensioners for too long. The bottom line for most pensioners is that a fair return on their bank deposits, plus their pension entitlements, is greater than their current pension income. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners and senior citizens in my electorate of Brisbane will also benefit from the Goss Government's decision to introduce an extensive package of reforms for Queensland's elderly. I am pleased that the honourable member for Wide Bay is still in the House to consider this comparison. The most significant of these reforms was the introduction of a senior citizens card in that State's recent Budget. The senior citizens card is a move designed to recognise properly the enormous contribution to society made by our senior citizens. It delivers a range of benefits to pensioners over 60 and to all senior citizens over 70 years of age. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Immediately prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was setting out to the House some of the arrangements that have been put in place in this Budget to assist, in particular, senior citizens and pensioners and, in doing so, replying to the comments that have been made by some honourable members opposite. I have made reference already to the initiatives undertaken not only by this Government but also, in my home State of Queensland, by the new Goss Government in introducing a senior citizen's card. That card provides discounts for government and quasi-government charges, including transport and electricity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Goss Government has shown, in contrast to its predecessor, that it is interested in the well-being of all senior citizens, not just those who wear white shoes. Indeed, in answer to the sorts of crocodile tears we have heard from the other side of this chamber, the Liberals and the Nationals in Queensland had some 30 years to prove their commitment to senior citizens and pensioners and on no occasion did they demonstrate any willingness to introduce the sorts of initiatives which the Goss Government has done in its first year of office. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am afraid that the third tier of government which directly impacts on the quality of life of pensioners in my electorate has been less than cooperative. I am referring to the harsh and draconian methods by which the Brisbane City Council applies its rebate policy for ratepaying pensioners. The Brisbane City Council, under the leadership of Liberal Lord Mayor Alderman Atkinson, has demonstrated its lack of consideration and compassion for the majority of pensioners by restricting the rates rebate it provides to senior citizens receiving full pensions only. If a person is on a part pension, the Brisbane City Council will not give him a cent. A number of my constituents who will supplement their pensions with bank interest income after the introduction of the deeming provisions will be severely penalised because of the Council's unfair rebate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this matter, the people of Brisbane are substantially worse off than are those in other cities around Australia. The State governments of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania assist holders of a pensioner health benefit card with local government rate remissions of between 20 and 60 per cent. In the case of Tasmania, 25 per cent is the minimum municipal rate remission, with many of the local authorities offering more extensive assistance to all pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to point out that the size of the Brisbane City Council budget is, in fact, similar to that of the State of Tasmania, and yet in Brisbane no attempt at all has been made to assist part pension recipients. Victorian ratepayers with a PHBS card receive a 50 per cent rebate up to $135 per year. A similar subsidy, but without an upper monetary limit, is offered in Western Australia. A 60 per cent rebate with an upper limit of $150 is available to card holders and social security recipients in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Alderman Atkinson constantly reminds us of the unique size and nature of the Brisbane City Council, she has not seen fit to use those unique resources to assist Brisbane's elderly ratepayers. The Liberal administration in Brisbane remits 40 per cent of the rate charged to the select minority of pensioners who receive the full pension. The State Government subsidises any holders of the PHBS card at 20 per cent for municipal rates, but the less than acceptable half-hearted approach from Australia's largest municipal authority falls far below the help given to pensioners in other States. Although the Brisbane Lord Mayor has toured overseas more times than the Prime Minister of Australia in the last 12 months, and in fact some 17 times in a little more than five years, she has not seen fit to relieve the rates burden on elderly Brisbane battlers. It is about time that the Brisbane Lord Mayor and her Council delivered a better deal for Brisbane pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to make some comment about the other issue in the Budget which has caused some distress to senior citizens and to pensioners. That concerns the $2.50 charge for scripts. I regret that, again, misrepresentation in the reporting of this event has caused needless concern amongst pensioners, many of whom I have had the opportunity to talk to and, again, many of whom are more than happy to accept the changes once they are explained to them in detail. That $2.50 charge per script is supported by a safety net to ensure that no pensioner is in a position of paying for more than 52 scripts, but of course the important factor is that it is offset by an increase in pension of $2.50 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of concern to me that reporting of that $2.50 in the Sunday Mail in Brisbane led to a great deal of worry on the part of pensioners, in most cases needlessly. The Sunday Mail ran an article some weeks ago in which it referred to increases in nursing home rates as a result of the $2.50 payment. It talked about 85 to 87 per cent of that $2.50 increase going to nursing home charges. The following day its sister paper, the Courier-Mail, printed the more factual version setting out in not such a prominent way the facts of the case, which were that the $2.50 does not apply for calculation for nursing home costs and, in fact, is separate for all purposes from other assessments, and that will include Housing Commission rental determinations. Again, we found that the misrepresentation of the facts in the Budget have needlessly caused alarm within some sections of the pensioner community. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not only in this Budget but over the term of its office demonstrated its commitment to pensioners and senior citizens. Arising from our actions, pensions will this year exceed 25 per cent of average weekly earnings from a point of 22.7 per cent inherited from the Fraser Government. In real terms, that represents an increase of 9.9 per cent in pensions since March of 1983. Under Fraser, under the Liberal-National parties when they had the opportunity to do some of the things they now talk about, pensions were reduced by 2.4 per cent in real terms. They are the stark facts. That is the reality. The rhetoric we have heard in this chamber in recent weeks sounds hollow in comparison to the Opposition parties' track record. </PARA>
<PARA> The various programs initiated by the Hawke Government in recent years have tended to shift the focus of the Budget away from the traditional area of public interest, namely, tax rates. Tax rates remain critically important to the personal disposable income of all Australians. The tax cuts detailed in the Budget provide a direct cash benefit to millions of Australian workers and their families. When Labor came to office in 1983 the coalition's tax scale had a bottom rate of 30 per cent and a top rate of 60 per cent. The Hawke Labor Government has cut the bottom rate by nearly a third to 21 per cent and the top rate has been slashed by 13 per cent to 47 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocritical claims on taxation of those opposite fly in the face of their own record of high taxation on Australian workers. To compound their felony, they left tax loopholes which corporate cowboys used all the way to the bank. Who could forget the bottom of the harbour schemes and the weekly advertisements in the financial press and business journals proudly offering schemes to eliminate tax payments for the rich and the irresponsible? To the shame of all Liberals and Nationals, the growth industry of the Fraser years was tax avoidance. Let us not forget that it was the current Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who were key Liberal economic strategists at that time. Indeed, some might even be so kind as to suggest that they are still the key economic strategists of the Liberal Party. The Government's programs set out in this Budget continue the program of reform and sound economic management which has characterised our term of office since 1983. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some comments on the matter of privilege raised by the honourable member for Calwell earlier today. Honourable members will recall that the honourable member raised as a matter of privilege an article by Mr M. Daly in the Melbourne Sunday Herald of 16 September which the honourable member stated revealed details of a submission the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations had determined should be kept confidential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I indicated to the House on 11 September, there are precedents for the disclosure of confidential committee documents being pursued as matters of privilege. I note that the Joint Committee has concluded that the article has constituted substantial interference with its work and that it wishes the matter to be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges.</PARA>
<PARA> Having considered the article and the honourable member's remarks, I am prepared to accord precedence to a motion in respect of the matter. Nevertheless, the procedure of the House of Commons in these matters, to which I drew attention last week, as well as requiring the relevant committee to form a view as to the damage done by the disclosure, requires that committee itself to seek to ascertain its source. The honourable member for Calwell has advised that the Committee was giving consideration to the matters raised on 11 September. Before proceeding further with the article complained of today, I believe that the Committee itself should consider taking whatever steps it may wish to in order to ascertain the source of this latest disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA> As this is the second occasion in four sitting days on which such a complaint has been raised, perhaps I should reiterate the points I made last Tuesday and expand on them. Before doing that, however, I might counsel the Committee that it might be in its interests to investigate this matter as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> I noted last Tuesday that since 1985-86 the British House of Commons had followed a specially developed procedure in these matters. If disclosure of the proceedings or draft reports of a committee is made, the committee concerned seeks to discover the source of the leak and to assess whether it constitutes or is likely to constitute a substantial interference with its work, with the select committee system, or with the functions of the House. If the committee considers that there has been or is likely to be such interference, the committee reports to the House accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the attitude I propose to take for the remainder of the Budget sittings. When a committee becomes aware of the unauthorised disclosure or publication of material, I propose that the Chairman, or another member acting for the committee, should inform me as soon as practicable. What I envisage is that the committee concerned would then follow procedures such as those applying in the House of Commons. If, as a result of its consideration of a matter, a committee presents a special report to the House stating that substantial interference has occurred and outlining the steps it has taken to ascertain the source of the problem, the Speaker would still be able to accord priority to a motion because he had been advised when the matter first came to light-that is, when the committee Chairman or member advises me accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> To enable members to have an opportunity to consider the special report from the committee before a motion is proposed, I would intend that a motion to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges should not normally be moved until the next sitting day. That would give members of the House a chance to see the committee's report and to form an opinion of the report prior to the matter being debated, if necessary, in the House.</PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear to honourable members that I am not in any way reducing their rights to raise complaints under the established procedures. Rather, I am spelling out to the House the particular position I propose to take in respect of complaints of the kind raised last Tuesday and again today by the honourable member for Calwell. This will give members an opportunity to form a view as to whether these procedures are worthwhile pursuing in this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak tonight on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Before I make my opening remarks, I refer to some comments made by the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) in regard to bottom of the harbour schemes. I ask the honourable member: Who introduced the legislation into the Parliament so that those bottom of the harbour schemes could actually be done away with? I wonder whether he knows that it was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who took measures to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps we ought to reflect on some of the other things that are happening in Australian society today if the honourable member for Brisbane wants to go back that far. What about all the work practices which this Government has allowed to continue in the industrial relations area which cost this country millions, probably billions, of dollars a year? For the honourable member for Brisbane to refer back to bottom of the harbour schemes and suggest that the honourable member for Bennelong and the former Government did nothing is arrant nonsense; it is not the case. In fact, it was the honourable member for Bennelong, who later became the Leader of the Opposition, who took action to change things. </PARA>
<PARA> In rising to speak in this Budget debate, I should point out that the first and clearest thing about this Budget is that it was built around no central framework. Five months after the election this present Government was unable to come to grips with some of the major decisions with which it was faced. The Budget has no framework, and yet there is no doubt that this was the year's most important statement to the Parliament. The Government had five months and was not able to come to grips with those necessary decisions, around which the Budget could be built. So we find that those decisions which should have been made will now be made by people outside this Parliament in the next week. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the context in which this country was given this Budget in 1990? What is the backdrop against which it was framed? What is the situation which many Australians and we as a nation face? The context can be summed up in a few clear statements. First of all, this country is faced with a massive debt crisis which has ballooned under this Government. A very clear example that can be used to illustrate that point is that this country, which came into being in 1901, had run up a debt of $33 billion by 1983. It took 82 years to run up $33 billion worth of debt. It has taken another seven years to run up $115 billion to $120 billion of debt under this Government. That is a graphic illustration of the way that this economy has been managed by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the inflation rate is double that of our major trading partners. Year by year this country becomes less and less competitive in world markets because our inflation rate is running away from us at twice that of our major trading partners. That is to say nothing of the backdrop which we are experiencing of high interest rates and people paying high interest rates for housing, in small business and so on. Of course, even though we have borrowed money from overseas, we now have rising unemployment rates. We have got this huge debt crisis blowing out month by month in the trading of this country, and yet we are now faced with unemployment rates as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only that, but we have also had six or seven good years of marketing. Commodity prices have been good. We have had good opportunities in the world market, and yet under the economic strategy of this Government we have gone further and further into debt. In addition, we have a Government which really has shown that it is not all that interested in development. It has shown to the business community that it prefers the green vote in Australia. As a consequence of that, in many parts of Australia there is now a substantial lack of confidence among members of the business community to go ahead with new projects or to replace old equipment which should be upgraded so that in their manufacturing processes they can be competitive and efficient on world markets. But that is not being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only is that not being done, not only is money not being spent in Australia to expand our industries, particularly manufacturing, but also the major companies are looking for-and, indeed, actually finding-places overseas and setting up manufacturing businesses in other parts of the world. That is because this Government has not given them the confidence that their developments will be able to go ahead. Of course, we only have to think back to the Wesley Vale development and Coronation Hill as illustrations. </PARA>
<PARA> The reactions of the public to this Budget can be summed up in a few short, sharp sentences. One comment, of course, has been `a Budget steady as she sinks'. It really is a Budget without a backbone. The way this Budget has been perceived out in the community is that there has been no central plank around which it has been developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me investigate why that perception has occurred. The fundamental reason is that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has adopted the attitude with the economy that 'she'll be right, mate'-that typical Australian approach. When difficulties arise, instead of grappling with them and showing some analysis of the issues and problems, the Treasurer, with the prime instrument, the prime document that comes into this Parliament each year, says that the problems are too big, that he has not been able to get the party together to make the right decisions, so `It'll be all right, she'll be right, mate, and it can all roll on and it will all come out in the wash'. I do not believe any Australians now accept that as an appropriate approach to the economic problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the Government has been giving out the wrong signals to the community, right back from the earliest days of Budget preparation. I believe also that this Government is now believing its own rhetoric that everything is okay. I shall go through seven very short quotations of things that this Treasurer has said on introducing each Budget. Going back to 1984-85, we find on page 1:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government policies are on track . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How many times have honourable members heard that the policies are on track? That is a statement that goes back to the earliest days of this Government. We then go to the next year, 1985-86. On page 1 we see:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence of our achievement is indisputable. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1986-87, at page 2:</PARA>
<PARA> We have made enormous progress in the past 3 years in modernising and freeing up the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1987-88, at page 2:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1988-89, at page 1:</PARA>
<PARA> We are now on the way back to prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1989-90, at page 2:</PARA>
<PARA> The challenge before us now is to get the best from this stronger economic structure. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, in 1990-91:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic policy has worked and is working. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is it that Australia has this huge overseas debt crisis if we have been on track for seven years? Why is it that we have a high inflation rate, double that of our major trading partners, when the Government says the economic policies have been working? If the economic policies of this Government had been working, we would not have a huge overseas debt crisis, we would not have an inflation rate that is double that of our trading partners, we would not have interest rates that are at least 1 1/2 times those of many other countries, and we would not have rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is total nonsense for the Treasurer to come into this House this year and say that the economic policies of the Government have been working. People have lost faith in this Government. I shall illustrate three different areas in which they have lost faith: the way in which the Government has treated the States; the way in which it has treated people at a personal level; and the way in which it has dealt with the responsibility of people in the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us first look at the States. This Government has said repeatedly, 'We are going to cut our budget. We have to cut our cloth so that it fits'. What one finds, however, is that the way in which this Government treats the States is markedly different to the sort of cost cutting it undertakes as the Federal Government. In 1982-83 the amount of money out of Federal revenue returned to the States was 40 per cent of the Federal Budget. Now, seven years later, 30 per cent of Federal Budget outlays is returned to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been saying to the people that it has to cut its expenditure; but where has that expenditure been cut? It has been cut at the State level, but the Federal Government has not cut its own Budget to the same extent. The reason for that, and no doubt it has been a purposeful, reasoned strategy, is that the Government wanted to increase the power of Canberra. This Government likes centralising power in Canberra and taking it away from the regions of Australia, therefore controlling as much as possible from Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> Those double standards have led to the great degree of cynicism now evident in the Australian population. On the one hand the Government says that the States must cut their Budgets, but federally over seven years effectively the Federal Government has not cut its Budget to anywhere near the same extent as it has cut the Budgets of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, many responsible people in our community see the welfare system as undermining stable social structures rather than buttressing the values that strengthen the quality of life in the community. I have some figures, which were up to date in about 1988, which show that a single income family with a dependent wife and two dependent children received, if they stayed together, about $2,000 of government support. If they separated, in effect they were $150 a week, or about $7,500 to $8,000 a year, better off. The system in Australia at present does not buttress those who take a responsible attitude to nurturing children, but actually encourages people to separate, because the financial benefits are at least $150 a week if a couple breaks up or separates. It is tragic when the Government actually gives a financial incentive to people to be irresponsible and not nurture their children in a caring family environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, parents have had their authority undermined, and that is especially so in regard to Medicare. A child of the age of 14 can demand privacy, can choose not to tell the parents something. The parents do not have a right to know, if the child wants otherwise. It is tragic that that sort of situation is developing in Australia for it undermines stable social structures in the community. All honourable members will be aware of many situations, particularly with regard to accommodation in housing commission homes in different States, where people, especially unmarried mothers-and I realise they do have to be cared for-have sought placement in commission housing. One finds that in the allocation of accommodation a single unmarried mother often will get preference over a married couple with one or two children. </PARA>
<PARA> What is being encouraged in this country? Do these attitudes encourage responsibility or discourage it? These days many people in the community query the very types of values that this Government has put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> At the personal level, to illustrate what has happened, from 1982-83 to 1990-91 income tax in this country has increased by 102 per cent. In the same period the average weekly earnings that people are being paid have increased by only 48 per cent. I can go on. The honourable member for Brisbane spoke about how much the Government had done for age pensioners. Their benefit has increased by 58 per cent, but revenue to the Federal Government has gone up 102 per cent in the same time. This Government has been sucking in much more taxation than ever before, and that money has not been returned to the ordinary citizens of this country. One would expect that if taxation revenue increased by about 100 per cent, unemployment benefits might have gone up by a similar percentage. They have not increased by anywhere near that margin, but by only 65 per cent. With regard to education, Austudy has increased by 68 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the Government's policies? I was interested to note today when listening to the debate on the matter of public importance that it seemed that Government members were able to espouse the Opposition's policies, or purported policies, better than they could state their own policies. If one went into the community and asked what was the telecommunications policy of the Labor Party at this stage, nobody would have a clue. The faceless people behind the Labor Party will have to make that decision next week-not the Cabinet, not the shadow Minister, not the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); people unelected to this Parliament will make that decision. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the situation of Keating versus Beazley and at the same time the Prime Minister wipes his hands of the whole issue. What about shipping and the waterfront? What is the Government's policy on this? How is the situation being revitalised and cleaned up? Why is it that it costs more for a container of products to go 130 miles from King Island in my electorate to Melbourne than for it to go from Melbourne to Glasgow? Why does that occur in Australia? The material is processed in Scotland and the alginate from the seaweed comes from King Island. </PARA>

It is cheaper to send a container of products halfway around the world than halfway across-not even right across-the Bass Strait. In this debate it has also been illustrated that it is cheaper to send a car from Melbourne to the west coast of America than it is to send a car from Melbourne to Tasmania. One can send a Ford Capri car from Melbourne to the west coast of the United States for $60 less than it costs to send it from Melbourne to Burnie. It is an absolutely ludicrous situation. What is the Government's policy with regard to the waterfront? What changes is it bringing in?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the area of industrial relations, all of the work practices are holding this country back and we are becoming more and more inefficient and less able to be competitive because the Government will not tackle the unions which give it its support. The Government will not address those issues. What is the Government's policy on inflation and the overseas debt-these two factors which are crucial to the way that Australia's economy is going? There is no response from the Government. There is no coherent set of policies. There is no direction, six months into a three-year term. We are at least 20 per cent of the way, and probably 25 per cent of the way, through the life of this Parliament and yet there are no clear directions. In particular key areas we are waiting until this coming week to see which way the Government will jump after the people who are not elected to this Parliament give them their riding orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this Budget has failed to address the economic issues which confront Australia at this time. It is a lost opportunity and it is a great tragedy that this Government has come back into power in this country and has not been able to get its act together and bring down a Budget which will help solve Australia's pressing economic situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it not amazing how differently two people can see the same document? This is a very weighty document, and in my remarks tonight I would like to consider the ways in which this document reflects the kinds of priorities that are appropriate for dealing with Australia's economic problems. Most honourable members who speak in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 dwell either-as the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has done in most of his remarks-on the macro-economic side of it or choose to dwell on individual programs. I would like to take a third tack and look at the priorities for expenditure programs that are a part of the Budget. That is very rarely talked about, but if one looks through this Budget one can see that some areas of expenditure have risen quite substantially because they directly reflect the Government's priorities. Those priorities, I expect, could be very simply summarised as covering two major areas-either economic development or social justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major national economic problem at present, most people would agree, is the size of the current account deficit. The question, therefore, is: What can be done by government to improve the dynamism of the economy so as to build up our capacity to export? There is a macro- economic question concerning what can be done to restrain imports as well, but the Budget, through positive fiscal policy, can build up our capacity to export, which involves increasing national productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The social justice question-the other main orientation of government policy-some people would call simply the quality of government services. The Budget does a lot to improve the quality of government services in a whole host of areas. I would like to go through and dwell upon the broad priorities that are reflected in these spending decisions. Firstly, I would like to mention two major areas of restraint which have made these other areas of growth in outlays possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The most obvious, of course, is that public debt interest in this Budget is 22.4 per cent lower in real terms than it was in 1989-90. That means that public debt interest is, in fact, $1,270m less this financial year than it was in the previous financial year. Of course, that is a direct result of the Government's fiscal restraint. The Government has been running a surplus for some years now. The benefit of that has been that it has been able to pay back a lot of public debt, and therefore it has been able to reduce the level of public debt interest. So it has $1,270m more this year which it can use on high priority outlays. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area that is very important and where I think there is scope for still more restraint is defence expenditure. In the last couple of years we have seen an improvement in the global strategic situation that is quite unprecedented in the post-war period. The Cold War is over and the superpowers have come to a number of agreements which have allowed them to sign disarmament agreements in several areas. They are both substantially reducing their defence expenditure and that is also happening in a number of the major western European countries. It is very appropriate, therefore, that Australia should be able to restrain its own defence expenditure. In fact, defence expenditure is up by 5.8 per cent in money terms, but that means that it is maintaining the real level of defence expenditure rather than increasing it. </PARA>
<PARA> The saving from not going ahead with an earlier planned 2 per cent real increase in defence expenditure is $161m in 1990-91. That is a very important saving. Of course, some people would note that we are now involved in a conflict in Iraq and that will increase the demands on our defence vote. That is absolutely true, but within a Budget of nearly $9 billion-$8,970m-it should be possible to cope with the outlays that are involved in the Iraqi conflict without too much trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two areas of restraint have created the opportunity for the Government to increase substantially its outlays in a number of very important areas which will directly contribute to increasing the dynamism of the economy or improving community services. I would like to go through a selected number of areas which I regard as being of very high priority and which have been substantially improved in this Budget. I will do that in the order in which they are shown in the Budget statements, not in any order of priority, because it makes this speech easier to prepare. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Braddon drew attention to the problem of marriage breakdown. That is a major problem in our society and, therefore, anyone concerned with that problem will warmly welcome the increase in allocations for marriage counselling. The Budget includes a promise that support for marriage counselling and family mediation will rise by $15m over three years from 1990-91-an increase of 13.7 per cent. That is a very significant increase. In my own electorate the allocation for marriage counselling will go up by 60 per cent-something that I have been strongly urging and which I wholeheartedly welcome. I think that the funds will be particularly well spent. Marriage counselling is a very cost-effective activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area where the Budget has allocated a substantial increase to outlays is education. Education outlays rise by 14 per cent, which is an increase of $920m or 7.3 per cent in real terms. In terms of the possible ways in which we could increase the productivity of the Australian economy, it is hard to imagine any area which is of a higher priority than education. Education is also a tremendously important community service, which meets the goals of improving both the dynamism and the social justice of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole series of components to that increase in education spending. For example, there are increases in higher education student places, the cost of which is $130m. I wholeheartedly welcome the increase in higher education capital funding of $89m. Yesterday I visited the Australian National University for its open day. One of the principal messages that the senior administrators from that university wanted to convey to me was the need for more capital investment in the university. For some years now the university has been unable to improve its capital equipment. The increase in the Budget will allow that kind of improvement to occur in universities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There are to be continuing real increases in general recurrent per capita funding for schools and an increase in Austudy payments. This is important not only to increase the number of students attending universities but also to improve the support they receive. So there are a whole lot of initiatives in that education program which anyone concerned with either the economy or community services would welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Another one which is worth mentioning is the additional funding for migrant education, $10.8m. On Friday I opened a new migrant English language centre in the ACT. It is centrally located and provides a very important service for new arrivals so that they can move effectively into the Australian community and get effective employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of outlays which many people will welcome is the 12.1 per cent increase in spending on culture and recreation. In a country which has a very high level of media concentration, the roles of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) are especially important. Yet the ABC and SBS are receiving the same real level of funding as was provided in 1989-90, namely, $33m additionally. Quite frankly, I do not think that is nearly enough but at least it maintains the real level of their outlays, and that is an important aspect of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that, there is additional funding to upgrade and expand national transmitting facilities. I am particularly glad to see that because for some time I have been talking in the House on the problem of receiving even ABC radio in a number of areas. Those transmitting facilities will allow a greater proportion of Australians to receive the ABC clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I turn to some of the economic services where the outlays have been increased. These are centrally important in expanding the dynamism of the economy. The area of transport and communication, for example, receives an increase of 14 per cent or 7.4 per cent in real terms. A lot of those funds are to be used for increased payments for roads. During the last election campaign there was a lot of debate about roads and the Government promised to increase that funding. It has fulfilled that promise: the increased payments for roads comprise $100m for the provincial cities and rural highways program; $53m for the road safety improvement program; and $25m for the establishment of an urban public transport program. Indexation of the Australian centennial roads development program permits an allocation of $91m. So that is a very substantial increase in total road funding, which will be welcomed by every driver in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to another centrally important area of outlays, labour and employment, there is also a substantial real increase of 8.2 per cent, a 15 per cent increase in money terms. At a time when regrettably unemployment is rising again, it is very important to provide programs which will maximise the opportunity of getting those unemployed back into employment. That is why the Government has substantially increased funding for employment programs. That increase includes, for example, an increase in the number of disadvantaged job seekers expected to be assisted under the various labour market programs, including Jobtrain, $28m; the early intervention program, $7m; the new enterprise incentive scheme, $6.1m; and Skillshare, $15m. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to draw attention to the new enterprise incentive scheme, which provides funds to encourage people to start small businesses themselves. In other words, the Government is encouraging entrepreneurship. That is one of the most cost-effective ways of getting people back into productive work. There are also increased funds for a number of existing programs like Newstart and JET and for apprenticeships. That too is an area which will increase the dynamism and the social justice of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn to an area which is of the highest priority for building up the dynamism of the economy, and that is scientific research. There can hardly be any area of Government outlays which in the long run makes a bigger impact on the productivity of the economy, on our capacity for innovation and, therefore, our capacity to export. It is particularly pleasing to note in the Budget that spending on general and scientific research is to rise by 19 per cent. That is a total level of spending this year of $763m, an increase of $122m or 12 per cent in real terms. That is a substantial increase in a Budget which was severely restrained by macro-economic considerations. Outlays are expected to increase in real terms in each of the forward years as well. Those increases this year go towards the introduction of the cooperative research centres program, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his election policy speech. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a particularly important program, which I wholeheartedly welcome. I am sure that all honourable members who are concerned about the dynamism of the economy will welcome that program. Certainly it has been warmly welcomed by the scientific and scholarly community in Australia. It will lead to $100m a year being spent within about three years on cooperative research centres. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, funding for research infrastructure in higher education institutions rises by $34m, as announced earlier by the Government. There is additional funding for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), which has risen by $5m. I should like to see that figure increased substantially. The CSIRO is a scientific research body of which Australians can be particularly proud. It has built up a major international reputation for the quality of its work. It has been restrained until recently and its funding needs to be substantially increased further. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area which has received substantial funding this year is environmental research, for which funding has gone up by $14m. In addition, the Commonwealth provides considerable support for industry research and development. It is important, of course, not only that we have public sector research but also that the Government support private sector research. It has had a major program for some years now through the extraordinarily generous 150 per cent tax deduction arrangements which were begun in July 1985 and which are estimated to cost this financial year $200m in forgone revenue. That is a major incentive to the private sector to increase its research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final area that I would like to dwell on and that is overseas aid. We have a responsibility through our foreign affairs concerns to express our social justice commitments internationally as well as locally. A billion people are living in absolute poverty internationally, the larger proportion of them in our region. We therefore have a very strong humanitarian as well as strategic motivation for our overseas development assistance. It has been very difficult for the Government to build up its overseas aid, but in this Budget, I am absolutely delighted to say, there is a real increase of 1.7 per cent. That is a substantial increase in money terms on the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for having persuaded his Cabinet colleagues of the importance of that. He will be wholeheartedly supported by hundreds of thousands of Australians who want to see our overseas aid increased. It was very impressive to see during the election campaign the 25,000 people who sent cards to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It was regrettable that, despite that, the Opposition in the election campaign said that it would reduce overseas aid by $100m. The Government said it would maintain the real level of aid; it has done so and done slightly better than that. I congratulate the Government for that piece of enlightened social justice, which is also significant in economic development terms. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget reflects the central priorities of the Government, but also, I think, of the majority of people in the community. It will contribute to increasing the dynamism of our economy. It will contribute to increasing our exports in both the medium term and the long term. I congratulate the Government on that and hope that those priorities will be reflected in future Budgets as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in this Budget debate. In this context I would like to draw the House's attention to the estimated outlays in the 1990-91 Budget of $9,253.5m for the Department of Employment, Education and Training, otherwise known as DEET. It is my belief that the proportion of this allocation used to foster the so-called education export industry should be reduced, as the industry no longer has the support of the Australian people. The claims of enormous revenues to be generated are turning out to be nothing more than a product of a fevered imagination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I stated in the grievance debate speech on immigration which I presented to this House on 31 May 1990 that I would be conducting a survey to determine the attitudes of my electorate to the current immigration policy. With the assistance of my staff and volunteers from the Liberal Party of Australia I have carried out the survey. Over 550 people in my electorate were telephoned on a random survey basis from 9 July to 10 August. Given that the Deakin electorate is middle urban Australian in composition and given that it is regarded as a marginal seat, the results of the survey should interest a number of members. Those responsible for setting our immigration targets might regard our present immigration policy as about right and enlightened or, as I have heard it described, even `adventurist'-that is, leading public opinion for the supposed good of the nation. My survey would suggest differently. I put it to the House that the policy is now so removed from general public support that its very existence is a source of community divisiveness. It is in great need of radical reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey findings present a gloomy picture of immigration policy in Australia today. Sixty per cent of respondents were dissatisfied with the Federal Labor Government's immigration policy. Fifty-seven per cent would prefer Australia to recruit only skilled migrants. Forty-one per cent would prefer those migrants to come from the United Kingdom or Europe. Many of those who stated that our migrants should be admitted from around the world often clarified this statement by saying there should be an even blend of migrants and that no one group should dominate the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifty-seven per cent believe that ethnic lobby groups have too much influence over government immigration policy. Many, it appears, now believe they have no control over the destiny of their own nation. Decisions affecting the future of all of us are now made by the faceless men and women of the `Immigration Club'. Forty-six per cent believe the Federal Government should not have given the Chinese students the right to remain in Australia. Sixty-five per cent believe these students should not qualify for government grants or benefits. Finally, 76 per cent-a very high proportion-believe that illegal immigrants should be deported. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Deakin would no doubt support the recommendation in the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Anyone who is illegally in Australia by unauthorised stay beyond the expiry of a visa, or by illegal entry, should forfeit the right to apply for immigration while here or be automatically rejected if they have already applied. </PARA>
<PARA>The electorate would be critical of the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, as many of my colleagues have been, as it presents a watered down solution to the problem of illegal migrants. We have only to talk to the man in the street to realise that many Australians are unsure of the future, believe our nation is being fragmented by competing cultures and languages and believe that Australians are being persuaded to forget their heritage in order to accommodate everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the education export industry, which has become almost another immigration scheme. Much has been made of the benefits of this industry to Australia, with the Government claiming it could become one of our biggest export earners. A report in the Australian Financial Review of 18 June of this year claimed that in the 1989-90 financial year one section of this industry, the English language intensive courses for overseas students, otherwise known as ELICOS, had revenues of $58m. While this might sound an impressive figure, there has been no allowance for the costs involved in producing that revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible to obtain accurate costings of some elements of the ELICOS program. The cost now includes social security payments to those ELICOS and other students from the People's Republic of China whom the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has allowed to remain in Australia. I believe this will be in the order of $50m. Additionally, there are the costs involved in repaying deposits to the at least 5,000 Chinese students-probably more on some estimates-who, due to visa changes, no longer qualified for a visa but who had already paid their course deposit. I am led to believe this will cost between $30m and $50m. But what are the costs incurred by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in policing the expired visas?</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the cost to the community arising from liquidation of those schools which entered the industry in good faith, but which now, due to government policy, have been forced to close. The changes have put hundreds of Australians out of work and disrupted the studies of the students. In a move which has all the hallmarks of the Pyramid settlement, the Hawke Government is not only paying the living allowances of those students who lost money when those colleges collapsed but also has come to an agreement with the remaining companies in the industry to accept the students from firms that collapse at reduced rates, with the Australian taxpayer, once again, picking up the tab. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is another major cross the Government has failed to take into account. Students on the whole either borrow the funds for their courses in their home countries and repay those loans with the money they earn in Australia or they bring to this country their spouses, who work to repay the loan. Either way, more money is sent out of Australia than is actually brought in. I suggest the total of these costs far exceeds the revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been written about the corrupt practices in which the English language schools have been involved. In a speech to the ELICOS industry the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said in part that there was a perception around that the private sector was being run by a motley collection of sharks, spivs and fast buck merchants. Whilst I partly agree with the Minister, there is obviously more than one guilty party. </PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly incumbent upon the Minister to look at his own responsibilities in this area. It is clear that little attention has been paid by the Minister to the Department responsible for administering the ELICOS scheme, his own Department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training. This Department appears to have been placed in somewhat of a dilemma. It was faced with the problem of whether it should charge full steam ahead in this new and potentially profitable export education industry or take a more conservative approach and endeavour to protect the fee-paying students, the reputation of this new industry and the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA> DEET, I am told, was aware of major problems with the ELICOS scheme from as early as 1987, only one year after the industry commenced as a money-making venture. DEET, with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, chose to ignore the rorts, the impact on migration policy and the reputation of the industry, and concentrated instead on trying to make a quick quid. </PARA>
<PARA> The first consequence of this approach was that a large number of students from the People's Republic of China obviously saw the loophole in the scheme and fully exploited it. It has been estimated that 27 per cent of the thousands of Chinese students who entered Australia as students in 1988-89 stayed on in this country to become illegal immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the public outcry, the Government has ordered a crackdown. In its later form this has meant that 30 Chinese students who are now illegal immigrants have been detained and held in the Maribyrnong detention centre in Melbourne; a number have since been released, have escaped or, after assaulting the attendants, have been transferred to Pentridge prison. The problem is that if the Government wants to detain any more of the thousands of Chinese students who are now illegal migrants it cannot use the Maribyrnong centre as it is now full. </PARA>
<PARA> As a further consequence of the crackdown we have recently had a number of collapses of companies involved in the export education industry, with the most recent ones being the Academy of English and its sister company Riddell Commercial College Pty Ltd. The former director of planning and projects at the Academy of English, Mr Frank Young, claims that almost half of the 115 ELICOS schools operating around Australia early this year have now closed. </PARA>
<PARA> With each collapse come further documents highlighting DEET's failings. The documents show that the schools have tried to abide by the letter of the law. DEET has deferred and changed decisions all too often for the benefit of the student rather than the interests of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to some of the correspondence that I have recently received. The first is a letter from the now defunct Academy of English dated 16 July of this year which was sent to Mr B. Hogan of the section in DEET responsible for ELICOS-the overseas student section, previously called the overseas student office (OSO). It says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>We are aware that students have been granted extension of visa below that level (90 per cent attendance) on representation to OSO. </PARA>
<PARA>By way of background I should explain that 90 per cent attendance means that students are allowed to miss only one day out of every 10 working days. </PARA>
<PARA> The Academy of English was not the only one aware of DEET's policy. In a letter to OSO on 27 June 1990, seeking guidance, L. V. International Business College, one of the few still in operation, complained that the student Kishore Kumare had been expelled from the school on two occasions and had an attendance level of 30 per cent. The school appears to have abided by the Government's requirements but the Melbourne office of DEET kept authorising Kishore Kumare's return to school. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government policy called for attendance levels of 90 per cent, why has DEET allowed students who have not achieved this rate the right to remain in Australia? One possible reason for this lack of action is hinted at by a former teacher at one of the colleges. The teacher, Ms Sharon Levy, claims that less than 10 per cent of her Chinese ELICOS students actually met attendance requirements. In effect, I believe DEET was overwhelmed by the problem and hoped, by ignoring it, that it would go away. </PARA>
<PARA> Judging from discussions I have had, there is a strong indication that some DEET officers are only too willing to give blanket approval for the extension of visas. The schools whose profit depends on student numbers, once aware of this weakness, exploited it at every conceivable opportunity. This policy also had tragic consequences. Taylors College wrote to DEET in July 1988 advising that the Malaysian Chinese business studies student Yap Hai Foong had been asked to leave as his behaviour, attendance and grades were not up to standard. Rather than being deported, this individual was allowed by DEET to re-enrol in another college, Riddells, which has also recently closed. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Yap Hai Foong next came to notice in October 1988 when, with a colleague, he attempted to rob a TAB agency in South Yarra, Melbourne. Stopped by police, Yap was shot by a policeman. This tragic event may well have been avoided if DEET had taken a firm stand on this matter much earlier, as it should have done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some indication that the Victorian office of DEET is the easiest of all for students to exploit. I have been advised that at least one student facing deportation in Queensland on the recommendation of the local DEET office simply moved to Melbourne, enrolled in a new course, hired a solicitor, convinced the Melbourne office that Queensland had the facts wrong, and had the decision reversed. It strikes me as somewhat illogical that DEET does not have a consistent national policy on this matter. It is not only the schools that have expressed frustration with DEET. Numerous landlords in Melbourne have advised DEET that their tenants are rorting the system. It appears that DEET takes as much notice of the landlords' information as it does of the formal advice from the schools. </PARA>
<PARA> In its efforts to assist the export educ- ation industry the Government has licensed some very unusual courses. One of the few growth areas at the moment is the kung-fu schools. Whilst I applaud their `coals to Newcastle' success in attracting students, I am seriously concerned that ELICOS students are withdrawing from their courses and enrolling in this softer option or, alternatively, extending their stay in Australia by enrolling in these non-formal courses. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major kung-fu schools is the World Wing Academy, although it was previously called the Wing Chun school. DEET conducted an investigation of this school and found widespread evidence of abuses, primarily related to the fact that, although the school had 450 students enrolled, on the two occasions DEET inspectors visited the school they found a total of only 10 students. DEET, in a surprising act of vigilance-most remarkable for DEET, given its record-actually suspended the school as a course provider. In an act which is perhaps more typical of DEET's behaviour, the suspension was mysteriously lifted some months later. Although the school was allowed to accept only 100 students, this, too, has changed. It is now, for some strange reason, allowed to accept 200. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice from media reports that in this Budget session the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is proposing to introduce legislation which will clean up the industry. The legislation, according to the media reports, will require that the approved institutions maintain trust accounts for student deposits. There is no mention of legislation requiring DEET to tighten up the administration of its program. Given its previous maladministration, there should certainly be such a tightening up. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage there is no sign of the proposed legislation. The whole country is aware of the boasts the Labor Government has made about the potential bonanzas from the industries it has sponsored. I am sure the whole country is now aware that these boasts, when made about the export education industry, are just the flim-flam of snake oil salesmen. The industry does need to be cleaned up and so does the body that monitors its performance-that is, the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I seek leave to table correspondence that I have already referred to from the Academy of English in Melbourne and the L. V. International Business College. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This years' Budget, like Budgets in previous years, is based on the integration of three arms of government policy: economic policy, environment policy and the Government's successful social justice strategy. As outlined in the statement circulated at the time of the Budget under the heading `Social Justice in the 1990s', with the Government's active social policy now in place and with an impressive record of income security and welfare reform already achieved in the 1980s, the Government now intends to extend its social justice strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an important part of the extension of that social justice strategy, the Government will be undertaking two major reviews. The first of these is the national housing strategy. Since 1983 the Government has been involved a great expansion of funding for public housing and a rearrangement of those measures that have ended up with large increases in the levels of rent assistance available to the disadvantaged, pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> Integral to those arrangements has been the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. That agreement allowed for innovative ways of arranging funding for both public and private residents and flexible tenure choices to deliver housing stock to those who were most in need. The aims of the strategy will be to analyse the various demographic and other factors involved, contribute to the assessment of how responsive housing policy is at the moment, and also look further at innovative ways of providing appropriate and affordable housing, especially for those on low incomes and those with special needs. It will look at remedying some of the fundamental structural problems in the overall housing market and, importantly, will explore the linkages between the provision of housing, employment and other infrastructure, especially community services. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major review that is presently being undertaken is the national health strategy review. Basically this arises out of the need to put in place new Medi- care arrangements in two or three years time. This opportunity has been taken to have a wide review of overall health policy. An important aspect of that review that is wider than just looking at the reagreement of the Medicare arrangements is the consideration of better integration of health and community services. Again we see a review that intends to highlight the need for linkages between different areas of policy provision. Importantly, it will also look at some of those public health services, especially in preventative health, that have perhaps been neglected over recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as these two major national reviews are being undertaken, this year's Budget places importance upon further investigation of what is known as locational disadvantage. During the campaign before the last election, especially as highlighted in the election policy speech, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) indicated the Federal Government's willingness to pay particular attention to the needs of the urban fringes of our major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly of interest to me because my electorate, being on the northern urban fringe of Melbourne, suffers many of the things that have been loosely identified as locational disadvantage. We have newer areas where people go to make their home, away from both physical and social infrastructure, which leads to all sorts of pressures, not only on an individual's personal well-being but also on the well-being of families. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the important things that the Government hopes to tackle under the heading of locational disadvantage are access to jobs, training and educational opportunities and recreational facilities. This is very much about looking at people's access to important facilities throughout all stages of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Access to social infrastructure means looking at adequate support devices that are often not there when people move into newer suburbs. In my particular area we have new suburbs which have gone into municipalities which are already facing a great deal of pressure because of underservicing. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this place about the need to address these deficiencies as well as the adequate provision in newer urban areas of the types of facilities that people require, especially when they are just starting a family-a time when the economic pressures are quite overwhelming and are exacerbated by trying to set up a home in a newer area. My electorate also has a very high migrant population. Some of the issues of the Government's present migration policy have to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> As with the national housing strategy review and the national health strategy review, one of the important aspects that has to be recognised in looking at urban fringe development is that no matter how much goodwill the Commonwealth Government has it cannot achieve anything by itself. A number of the responsibilities are shared with State and local governments and some of the responsibilities belong directly to State and local governments. For instance, if we look at the responsibility for land use and transport planning, we find that these are very much the cooperative effort of State and local government.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we should quite rightly have a major interest in these issues, often that fact has been overlooked. At least in this term of office the Government has put itself on notice to the public that it is willing to look at these issues and, wherever possible, to become actively involved in the planning and delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, share the frustration of a number of people in this place. That is, when we look at a number of the programs that emanate from the Federal Government we find that they are often either delivered by a State government or delivered with the cooperation of a State government. Often the contribution of the Commonwealth Government is overlooked. There is nothing more frustrating than when something in one's electorate is announced and duly some representative of the State Government goes ahead and takes full credit for what is occurring. As I said, this is the source of a great deal of frustration to some of us. I know that on some occasions it has been a great source of frustration for you, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> Another frustration is when one goes out to try to lobby on behalf of the community or a community group and tries to exert some pressure on Federal Ministers, only to be told, 'No, it is under a Commonwealth-State arrangement and it is best that you try to lobby the State Minister'. We really need to look at some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to see the speech that was made by the Prime Minister at the National Press Club on 19 July entitled `Towards a closer partnership'. He addressed a number of the problems that confront Australia as it goes into the twenty-first century-problems that arise from the way in which the Federation actually works. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's second Prime Minister and one of the Founding Fathers, Alfred Deakin, once said about Federation:</PARA>
<PARA>To those who watched its inner workings, followed its fortunes as if their own, and lived a life of devotion to it day by day, its actual accomplishment must always appear to have been secured by a series of miracles. </PARA>
<PARA>If miracles were needed to found the Federation, it is difficult to imagine what it would take to reform it, especially if it requires a change to the Constitution. It is a sad fact that throughout Australia's history as a nation there has been tremendous difficulty achieving constitutional reform. Of the 42 proposals to alter the Constitution since Federation, only eight have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution was hammered out in the 1890s to meet the needs of Australia in a new century. Australia was then a vastly different place with different needs, and was part of a different international community. We should remember that at that time the sun had not set on the British Empire. When our predecessors went down to the Parliament in Melbourne at that time they were able to either take a steamship or come down by train. Communication was much different. The print media was dominant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no reason to assume that the provisions of the Constitution are appropriate to respond to the needs of Australia as we prepare for the twenty-first century. As Sir Robert Menzies, a person whom I am not usually driven to quote, said in 1967:</PARA>
<PARA>A written Constitution is an express scheme of Government designed to give a basic structure in a changing world, not designed to inhibit growth in a growing world, nor to make the contemporary world subject to the political, social or economic ideas of a bygone age. </PARA>
<PARA>Is not that exactly what is happening today? The anecdotes are well known but worth recalling. The Prime Minister exemplified this in his address that I mentioned earlier at the National Press Club. </PARA>
<PARA> A cargo container being sent by rail between Sydney and Perth may be subject to three non-integrated rail systems, four changes of locomotives, five different safe working systems, six different sizes of loading gauge, 10 different engineering standards of basic standard gauge rail track, and 12 or more hours at sidings or junctions for crew changes, refuelling and inspections. Obviously in reforming our national rail network we need to overcome these hurdles that Federation has placed before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take another area-education. It is sad to say that school children in different States of Australia learn different systems of handwriting. This is a symptom of a wider malaise. In May 1988 the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) highlighted the need for a national perspective on schooling to help Australia adjust to current economic and social pressures. Among other things he identified the need for curriculum reform and especially the development of a common curriculum. A Curriculum Corporation of Australia has been launched to develop cooperative curriculum materials on behalf of State education Ministers. A statement of common principles and agreed areas for collaborative action of curriculum development for mathematics was developed by the Australian Education Council. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement, commonly known as the Hobart declaration on Australian schools, clearly sets out the mathematical knowledge and skills to which all Australian students are entitled. The significance of the Hobart declaration should not be underestimated. Further areas of curriculum reform have been and are being developed as flagged in this Budget. Beyond this it is to be hoped that a comprehensive national curriculum is on the horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one could doubt the overwhelming success of the Government's home and community care (HACC) program, first introduced by the Government in the 1984-85 Budget. This program involves the participation of all three spheres of Government and the community sector. Despite the undoubted success of this innovative program, it became apparent after a period of operation that differences in standards, service levels and interpretations of the program guidelines had developed between States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled There's No Place Like Home, which reviewed the efficiency audit of the HACC program, some of these issues were identified. In evidence before the Committee, the Australian Office for the Aged stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Whenever you have a joint administration you are going to get friction and overlap and administration falling down cracks. </PARA>
<PARA>In Victoria there have been some problems in relation to the definition of the HACC target group. In his recent address to the National Press Club, the Prime Minister suggested that the welfare area is an appropriate starting point for a review of Commonwealth-State relations. I agree with this. In fact, much of the necessary review of the HACC program and the problems it has encountered has taken place in various reviews such as the Auditor-General's review and review of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. So there is a good basis for starting to eliminate inequality and inefficiency where it has arisen. The Commonwealth is implementing the first national system of needs-based planning for aged services. It is important for the national Government to ensure that all Australians have equal access to equal services. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at further disparities as a result of Federation. Each State has its own separate design requirements for water meters and its own standards for chemicals used in agriculture. We have different road laws, driving licences, product packaging and safety standards. One State demands that margarine be sold only in a package shaped like a cube. I could go on. As Europe proceeds inexorably towards complete economic union in 1992, Australia languishes in a Federal system designed to satisfy the vested interests of the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA> Tackling these issues should be the agenda for micro-economic reform, not simple questions of ownership. What Australia needs in the 1990s is to confront the question of reform of the Federal system. No-one could deny that the functions and roles of all spheres of government have not vastly changed since the Second World War. Local councils now provide a vast range of services beyond those provided even 20 years ago. Long gone are the days of the three Rs of local government-roads, rubbish and rates. </PARA>
<PARA> As people's expectations have changed so too have the requirements of our system of government. The recognition of the need for reform of our Federal system is long standing. As Don Dunstan said in the 1970s:</PARA>
<PARA>The system as a whole is inefficient and debilitating. And as the years pass the writing of the Constitution becomes enveloped in the mists of time, that well known contagion of Federated States can be seen developing high-minded reverence for the Founding Fathers. Any criticism of their document becomes a kind of political blasphemy. They are even now being seen as far-sighted, despite the fact that when they drew the document up about the only matters they considered crucial to national Government were defence, an end to customs barriers and an efficient post office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, as Dunstan went on to point out, the Founding Fathers were State politicians protecting their State interests. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We are now left with the results of their work; a system of sovereign governments whose boundaries bear no relation to physical, social or economic geography, and which are limited in their attempts to legislate efficiently in such important areas as trade practices or national transport because the framers of the Constitution on the one hand did not believe that governments should be concerned with the economy or business practices, and on the other they foresaw no problems emerging. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not true to say, however, that the Founding Fathers gave no significant domestic powers to the Commonwealth. In fact, the Federal Government has far more access to the financial resources of the nation than under comparable federal systems. In Australia approximately 77 per cent of total public revenue is raised by the Federal Government. This compares with 62 per cent in the United States, 51 per cent in Canada and 49 per cent in West Germany. If anything, the federal system is unbalanced. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no area where the policy difference between the Labor and Liberal-National parties is so stark than in relation to the reform of the role and power of the Federal Government. Many commentators regarded the Whitlam Government's attempts to resolve this imbalance as one of a centralist government, but this was not the case. Certainly the Whitlam Government tested as never before the extent of the Commonwealth Government's powers in relation to domestic affairs, and certainly that Government, to its credit, explored the greater involvement of the Commonwealth in the provision of an array of services. But the Whitlam Government was as much regionalist as it was centralist. It was under the reforms of that Government that considerable power was devolved to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> As Australia heads for the next century facing great challenges as a nation, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has put forward some half-baked schemes such as giving the States the power to raise their own revenue along with other powers which will inevitably lead to greater barriers between them.</PARA>
<PARA> It is often said that Australia is over-governed. This may be so. In an era of mass communication perhaps it is the need for State governments that is waning. Ordinary Australians are appalled when the morass of bureaucratic overlap is pointed out to them. As the Prime Minister has said:</PARA>
<PARA>We have imposed upon ourselves a burden of different rules and regulations and requirements which needlessly weighs against the tremendous advantages we can have as a nation-continent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the nation sees the current Budget as a wasted opportunity, a chance after an election for an incoming government to show some vision and set out some plans for the next three years. Usually, the first Budget after coming to office is one in which the Government takes the hard decisions, realising in a practical political sense that that is the time when the community is most likely to assess the Government as doing what it was elected to do. The Government then has roughly a two-year period to put those plans in place and to gain popularity through the third Budget for the forthcoming election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this instance, the Government has adopted a Budget which says, in effect, that the nation should be steady as she sinks. This Budget does not contain one initiative or one vision for the future. In fact, the Treasurer (Mr Keating), in commencing his Budget Speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>Economic policy has worked and is working.</PARA>
<PARA>For the people of Australia this Budget represents more of the same policies. When one looks at the result of the election, one sees that the community could not make up its mind as to which party it wanted to govern but in fact cast slightly more votes for the Opposition than it did for the Government. I would have thought that any wise government in those circumstances would say, `Let us pick up some of the best ideas from the Opposition. Let us use our own best ideas and get into place at the earliest opportunity a policy that we can consolidate over the forthcoming three-year term'. </PARA>
<PARA> The two to three years that is the life of a parliament in Australia give the Government at the most three opportunities for major economic impact. I do not think that everything should be done in the Budget, but coming so shortly after the election, following the swearing in of the Ministry and members of parliament, the Budget was the first opportunity for the Government to say that it had some idea of where the nation was heading. In fact, the Government, since its election, has given every impression that it did not expect to win and that Ministers came to office with half thought through ideas that they are now floundering to knock into shape as hard policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The half thought through ideas of the Government are not backed by detailed examination and research. In fact, one can run through the areas in which the Government is staggering at the moment and realise that in the areas of privatisation, work practices and wages policy, and the environment, the Government has no clear plan, no idea, no prospect for the future. The Government is dealing with each issue as it arises. That is a process of crisis management. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Fife" NAMEID="CG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr Fife</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is virtually paralysed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good description. The Government is paralysed between periods of feverish activity. It is attempting to sort out the rights and wrongs of particular issues and as well deal with the furore and divisiveness of the back bench and the Caucus room, eventually to come forth with a policy that represents the Labor Party. In doing so, the Government is stretching a very long bow. Having belted factions into shape, conducted public meetings and gone through all the processes, the Government claims that that is the policy for all Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, it is not. It is a policy for a small group of people in Australia. It is a great shame that this incoming Government that has done much-not all of it good, not all of it bad; more bad than good, I would suggest-has no idea where it is going to be in three years time. It has no idea where Australia ought to be in three years time. It has no idea where the men and women and families of Australia should be in three years time. So, staggering from crisis to crisis, it gives every impression of being a government that is on its last legs. It does not have the will or the drive to carry forward the great responsibilities of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess there are many on the back bench of the Labor Party who are absolutely frustrated by this process. They are the people who have some ideas and want to see things done. Some of those people are on the extreme left of the Australian Labor Party and some of them are on the right. The trouble is that they are not communicating too well with each other on these important issues. They have not pre-planned the processes. They have not thought them through. In fact, the policies presented by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his election policy speech were a grab bag of ideas stitched together and presented in the usual slick manner to make them sound good. The Labor Party did not take the care to ascertain whether these policies could be translated into realistic on the ground legislation or decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Australian community want? The two main sections of the community I can identify that have really strong views are the Australian families and Australian small businesses. These groups seem to hold the key to much of the success of our nation. Small businesses want lower interest rates. They want enough skilled workers, a reasonable level of taxes, and they want to avoid having the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) control their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> They are fairly simple and achievable goals. This Government could assist business to achieve those goals but it has no plan for those great employers of Australians. So, what is the result of not having a clear-cut goal? The result will be rising unemployment, businesses closing down, and pain and disaster for many Australian families. Those people are looking right down the barrel of a gun.</PARA>
<PARA> In my own electorate business after business is closing in the most painful, horrific ways. Some of them have been forced to close by some of the activities of slick money operators. Honourable members know the type. They are the friends of the Prime Minister. They are seen frequently at the Lodge. The Prime Minister telephones them for advice. I will not mention names, but they are at twenty-first birthday parties and all sorts of events together. These groups together run Australia as Australia Incorporated. They include a dozen people at the most. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those people, by their callousness, have brought about needless pain to small businesses. Much of the pain, however, has been brought about by the conscious policies of the Government and the conscious policy of the Treasurer squeezing this country with high interest rates until enough businesses are broke for the Treasurer to say that the problem is fixed; until there is enough unemployment for him to say the problem is fixed; until there are enough taxes paid for him to say the problem is fixed; until there is enough compliance with the ACTU for him to say the problem is fixed; and until there is enough reduction of educated and skilled young people for him to say the problem is fixed. That is the policy instigated by the Treasurer. That is what he is saying here day after day. That is what he said in his Budget Speech-that the economic policy has worked and is working. </PARA>
<PARA> The other group, the families of Australia, want enough to live on, they want their jobs and they want to be left alone by government. One has only to look at the record of this Government to realise that the disposable income for each family has declined dramatically, especially over the last three to four years. At the end of the week the amount of money left which can be used for non-essentials has diminished. For those on fixed incomes, it has gone completely; they have no options left. </PARA>
<PARA> After multiple changes to all the retirement benefits of Australia-six or seven in fewer years-then fiddling at the margins with health schemes and pharmaceutical benefits, that group of people on fixed incomes are in a dreadful circumstance not understood by government. Their families the younger families of which they are still members-are now saying, 'How can we continue to support our older relatives in desperate days when we ourselves are meeting so much of our outgoings with higher interest rates and increasing inflation, extra cost every shopping day, extra cost every yearly family budget?' So these two groups-the small business community of Australia and the families of Australia-are the ones that are suffering most. Their needs are simple and straightforward, but the Government offers neither vision nor prospect for them. All the Treasurer can say is, 'Our economic policy has worked and is working'. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is a crisis management government-do nothing: crisis: do nothing: crisis. Since it has been returned to office it has been one thing after another in that pattern-do nothing: crisis. Do not plan ahead; do not do anything to generate a strategy to solve a problem before it becomes serious but just stagger from one crisis to another. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to look at some of the reports that came out in June, and I refer in particular to the quarterly business survey of the National Australia Bank. In June, I would like to tell honourable members opposite, there were precisely the problems that we are coping with now in September with this Budget, spelt out by one of those terrible National bankers. The survey shows that employment expectations by a range of employers were for increasing unemployment for the June quarter, for which they did not know the figures, for the September quarter and for subsequent quarters. The writing was on the wall then in the survey by the National Australia Bank. We can look through the manufacturing industries, the construction industry, retail, wholesale, transport, finance, and recreation industries, every one of which said, 'There is going to be increasing unemployment in the months ahead'. This is a survey conducted on a regular basis over hundreds of businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Another question was: what is the expectation for the business? They said that jobs were going to be lost. When they were asked the question about their forward ordering situation-`What likelihood have you got in the next three to six months to extend your order book, pick up business and recover the situation of increasing unemployment?'-what did they answer? They said that their order books were getting worse and worse. Their expectations were down and down. Not only were they expecting to lay off people-and are now laying off people-but also they were not expecting any expansion in their businesses which would allow them to recover that situation. Throughout those areas of mining, manufacturing, construction, retail, wholesale, transport, finance and recreation, the expectation for the order book was bad news, disastrous news. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a staggering government-crisis: inaction: crisis: inaction-the sign of a government that is in absolute decay. It is a government with no plans for the future; a government which can do a deal with its mates in the Victorian Government to buy out its bank and then encourage that Government to spend more money in sponsoring the Olympic Games. Imagine it. The Victorian Government is an incompetent government, its incompetence proved over and over again with all of the fancy, shonky deals it went into, and this Government is going to allow, encourage, in fact sponsor that incompetent Government by bailing it out, first of all by buying its bankrupt bank and then by giving it dough to run the Olympic Games. Senator Walsh is right: why would we give that mob encouragement to spend anything?</PARA>
<PARA> Neville Wran had the opportunity to run the Olympic Games in the bicentennial year. He knocked it back. I think that was a tragedy. We could have had it in Australia in better times. We could have had it in Australia when people were more confident and had more money. But in this day and age, to encourage the mob in Victoria to run the Olympic Games is the last thing any responsible government should do. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross domestic product (GDP) is heading down. We only have to look at the figures for the last three years to see that. The gross and net debt is going up, and yet the Treasurer says, 'The economic policy has worked and is working'. Fancy that! So that is the Treasurer's policy: declining GDP, increasing gross and net debt, and the Treasurer saying, 'That is what I want'. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the period of the last few months I have mentioned the Government's do-nothing crisis in privatisation. We are right in the middle of it now. I do not know what revelation next Monday will bring. I see the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) smiling. I spoke to one of his senatorial colleagues from New South Wales this morning, in fact, and he said that that was quite a meeting on privatisation held in New South Wales yesterday, and next Monday may well be the same. But here is the Government going out to a group of people that are not really supporting privatisation and putting its life in the hands of people who do not support it. </PARA>
<PARA> I support privatisation wholly and solely and we thought through detailed policies to privatise. As for Martin Ferguson and wages and work practices: goodness, gracious me, dark days! That is going back to the dark old days of confrontation. I had a lot of respect for Jack Ferguson, Martin's father. His word was his bond. He was a wonderful State member. He was of the left of the Labor Party, but he was a good bloke. However, Martin is out to make his mark and he is going to do it at the cost of the jobs of many thousands of Australians. He is going to put businesses out of operation just to suit his ego and make his mark. It is tragic that the Labor Government, which claims to represent those people, claims to be able to manage with accord after accord after accord, has failed. </PARA>
<PARA> Crisis management! We do not have to look at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Let us look at the environment for the classic example. The Federal Government gets involved in a State issue down there at Eden in relation to forestry, and says, 'We have to have a say here'. Having had the say, having got the cards in its hands to control the situation, it cannot do it. It does not know what to do. It does not know what the solution is. So we have the spectacle here in the chamber of Ministers playing with words against each other and leaks from the Cabinet room against each other. Do nothing: crisis: do nothing. The pattern is there: a failing government, a government that does not want to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a government that can in seven minutes deregulate and deregister the pilots. It has taken seven years to do nothing on the waterfront. How about that? Seven years to do nothing on the waterfront, and yet it can pick out the pilots and knock them off. Easy, is it not? Okay, it does not matter in the ballot box; where it counts is on preselection. That is the fact of the matter. The Government is dealing with its mates, and that is where the country is going wrong and the Government has lost its way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many items in the Budget that I would like to give passing comment to. The decision to dump the first home buyers scheme, I think, was a tragedy. The scheme was failing and costly, but there is nothing to replace it. The Government is just dumping it on the States and hoping they will pick it up somehow or other. There are no plans, nothing has been thought through. It just hopes that the State governments will look after the first home buyers in this dreadful period they are going through. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the decisions the Government has entered into on the assets test for small business people and for farmers. The family allowance and the family allowance supplement are now tested by an assets test. Above all, there is the tax regime. We are now approaching a situation we had a couple of decades ago where there is positive encouragement for people to devolve their businesses into family trading or investment companies. The tax rate on family or investment companies is at 39 per cent and the upper personal tax rate is at 48.25. For three years that has been the situation. People are now going to stop behaving as individuals. They are going to start to build family companies, and that is a tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My contribution to this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 will concentrate on the plans of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) for micro-economic reform and, more particularly, on the economic implications of the Government's stated and foreshadowed proposals for the privatisation and deregulation of a range of government enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition and political commentators are somewhat prematurely proclaiming the Hawke-Keating Administration as that point in history when Labor broke away from its traditional heritage and extinguished its light on the hill. They see this happening in Labor's rejection of the Keynesian social democratic policies of deficit financing and public sector expansion in favour of adopting a right wing economic rationalist approach to solving the structural problems of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> That speculation has, of course, been greatly encouraged by recent ministerial comment. The Treasurer, in describing his reforms, uses phraseology such as `a watershed in the thinking of the Australian Labor Party'. Whether these admittedly fundamental economic changes constitute a permanent catapulting of Labor deep into the spectrum of right wing politics or merely a temporary aberration during tough economic times remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the hallmarks of the Hawke Administration will no doubt be recorded as fiscal restraint, deregulation and privatisation of public enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The political rhetoric underpinning these radical changes has been that Labor's great goal of social justice lies in the economic recovery and employment growth that will naturally evolve from a more competitive market. This blind faith in the inherent value of competition is characteristic of the thinking of economic rationalists that dominate both the Thatcher and Hawke Cabinets. I use the words `blind faith' advisedly, because the history of free market economies has not been spontaneous movement to an economic nirvana; rather, it has been characterised by periodic crises associated with the recessionary phase of the business cycle and by general systemic crises. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances it was predictable-to all, of course, but the Labor Party faithful-that when macro-economic measures of financial deregulation, tax cuts, high interest rates, massive surpluses and the concomitant cuts to government spending all failed to make any significant impression on the external debt or the underlying high rate of inflation the Government would follow in Mrs Thatcher's footsteps and put privatisation on the top of the economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> The most interesting argument proffered to justify the recent proposals to sell off the family silver is that the exercise constitutes micro-economic reform. The Treasurer has eloquently argued in his Budget Speech that our new guiding light should be to make all levels of government business more innovative, efficient and competitive to ensure that they are not holding back our industries and are delivering a proper level of services to the community. Following this beacon, we are assured, will see us overcome the deep-rooted structural weaknesses in our economy-created, we are told, by Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser-allow us to build a more balanced, independent economy and, thus, ensure lonely little Australia's survival in an increasingly predatory world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The assumptions that I would like to challenge in analysing these plans for privatisation are whether competition will always provide the economic returns claimed and whether the specific privatisation proposals constitute micro-economic reform in any event. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I deal with the actual privatisation measures, I would like to make some general remarks about the problem of meeting the capital needs of government businesses-notably, the questions of the public sector borrowing requirement, Loan Council controls and gearing ratios. Despite the fact that the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development system of national accounts conventions treat assets sales and equity injections as financing transactions which have no effect on the size of the deficit, the Australian Treasury puts them on budget, adopting the irrational approach that ownership, not function, should be the determining factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, we are constantly confronted with the argument that to fund essential capital injections to government business enterprises (GBEs) from the Budget means cutting other expenditure-usually social justice programs. However, the same phoney convention is not applied to government owned financial institutions which are treated in the same way as private business. This placement of GBEs in the public sector means, of course, that their borrowings are treated in the same way as all government borrowings. They become part of the deficit and are subjected to the public sector borrowing requirement, Loan Council controls and global limitations. The subsuming of GBE borrowings within the general government sector deficit brings into play the impact of the fiscal indicator called the public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> In these days when a government's financial reputation seems to be directly related to the size of its surplus, it is predictable that no Treasurer working within these irrational accounting conventions is going to look kindly on several billion dollars worth of GBE borrowings eating up his Budget surplus, but will welcome with open arms asset sales reducing the outlay side of the nation's accounts. However, private financial markets are not fooled by these conventions and frequently go to the trouble of calculating the true deficit figure by discounting the sales of equity. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is accentuated by the Loan Council global controls on government borrowings being applied to GBEs, making it extremely hard for them to obtain capital to pursue development projects. The Treasury has yet to justify rationally how these controls fit within the picture of deregulation and micro-economic reform. One would have thought that the objective of such policies was to allow enterprises freedom to pursue their commercial interests and thereby maximise the efficient allocation of societies' resources. The obvious truth is that if one is about micro-economic reform, the ownership of the business is irrelevant. Allowing all enterprises, be they public or private, to maximise their present value is the only sensible way to achieve a higher level of wealth and income for all Australians. The Loan Council's policy of limiting the potential of GBEs can only produce a less than optimal allocation of resources. The simplest and greatest micro-economic reform of all would be to rid ourselves of these shackles on government businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the question of gearing ratios. Recently the Treasurer, in justifying the need for the Commonwealth Bank to pay for the State Bank of Victoria by raising 100 per cent of the purchase price as equity, argued that it was not prudent for the Commonwealth Bank to have a higher gearing ratio than its private competitors. Similar things have been said about Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd which need to borrow billions of dollars to fund aircraft purchases. Bank managers will say that they see gearing ratios merely as an indicator of the commitment of shareholders to their enterprise. They take the view that loans should not be given to people who have no incentive to avoid failure. However, GBEs are government backed, usually by guarantee but always by moral and political necessity. Just as the State Bank of Victoria could not be allowed to fail, neither can Telecom Australia, Qantas or Australian Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the point of gearing ratios for GBEs is not a question of prudentiality but of achieving the most efficient and effective structure for their business. Higher ratios exert pressure on management to maximise the performance of assets; lower ratios allow the business to ride out times of crisis. The correct financial gearing is clearly predicated upon the nature of the industry and the economic environment that the GBE is operating within. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made these general remarks, I now comment on some of the specific plans for privatisation. Often forgotten in the heated debate about Telecom, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank are the proposals to sell the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. The sale of the HLIC is not likely to obtain more than between $10m and $50m. It is a very successful, highly efficient business that was started by borrowing a mere $300,000 and which has made consistently high profits amounting to $25m over the last five financial years. Its return to the Government will far exceed the value of any debt that might be retired from the proceeds of its sale. So much for the guiding light of micro-economic reform. For some time now, that Corporation has been successfully resisting bids by its private sector competitors to raise premiums on mortgage insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Our housing industry is in the depths of recession, with high interest rates making it very hard for new home buyers to scrape up the deposit, stamp duty, legal fees et cetera that go towards building a home. Affordability is the key factor. An additional premium impost will be just another straw to break the backs of thousands more potential home buyers. It is ironic that the sale of the HLIC will reduce competition in that industry by taking out a lean, mean and highly efficient government player and substituting a private corporation, which will immediately collude with the others to force up premiums. </PARA>
<PARA> The sale of the pipeline will be no joy to gas consumers. Inherent in the legislative arrangements are two hikes of 25 per cent in carriage costs on the pipeline. Some 100,000 New South Wales pensioners will find their gas bills increasing substantially as a result. Where are the efficiency gains here? The pipeline is a natural monopoly, the most efficient economic unit. There should and will be no competition. Professor Walker of the University of New South Wales has pointed out that increasing costs are the inevitable consequences of the sale. Privatisation simply will not make the industry more efficient. The argument that is currently being touted, that the Government has to weigh the benefits of continued ownership of public enterprises against the development of essential infrastructure, is fundamentally unsound, because the benefits to fiscal policy of asset sales are merely cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> As the eminent economist Willem E. Buiter pointed out, nationalising or denationalising becomes relevant only where the total net worth is positively altered by improved efficiencies. If the financial consequences are neutral or negative, we should not be privatising. That is why I cannot understand those within my Party and the Opposition who want to sell off all or part of the Commonwealth Bank. The Budget Papers reveal that the Commonwealth Banking Corporation is expected to pay a dividend of $158m. That figure is likely to change in the light of Cabinet's decision to privatise an initial 30 per cent and eventually 49 per cent of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no objection to the purchase of the State Savings Bank of Victoria. It is unthinkable that this Government could have allowed the crisis in confidence that would have flowed from a run on the largest bank in Victoria and the fifth largest bank in the nation. What angers me and the overwhelming majority of Labor's branch members and supporters in Australia is the decision to find the $1.6 billion purchase price by selling 30 per cent of the bank to private interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The most annoying feature of the decision was Cabinet's failure to explore options to finance the purchase in a way that would maintain the bank as an entirely public owned enterprise. The statutory capital adequacy requirements would allow the purchase to take place with an additional equity injection of only $400m, the balance being made up in subordinated debt. No-one would suggest that the Commonwealth Bank could not find $400m. The surplus employer reserves in its staff superannuation fund vastly exceed that amount, even after tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, though not denying the bank's capacity to meet the capital adequacy requirements, nevertheless takes the view that it is desirable that there be a substantial injection of equity into the bank to allow it to enter into bullish competition with the private banks and to maintain what he described as a prudent gearing ratio. I have pointed out already that the gearing ratios of a government backed enterprise cannot and should not be equated to private enterprises. The test should be the ratio that will best achieve the goals of the government enterprise. Higher gearing, provided it falls within the statutory prudential requirement, is simply not a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many sound reasons why the bank should not be partially privatised. The most obvious can be distilled from the current row the Treasurer is having with the banks. There is no doubt that the banks have been conniving for some time to keep interest rates artificially high. As the Treasurer points out, measured in 90-day bank bills, the cost of money has fallen from 18.4 per cent in 1989 to 13.5 per cent now-a fall of almost 5 per cent. However, the banks have reduced their charges for home loans by only three quarters of one per cent. The reason is clear: they have had their fingers burnt to the tune of more than $1 billion by bad debts incurred by the crashes of the empires of our corporate cowboys-Skase, Bond, Elliott and the likes. Instead of making an honest market, they have chosen to rip off consumers to protect shareholders' dividends. A Commonwealth Bank with board obligations, albeit to only 49 per cent of the private shareholders, would be subject to the same temptations to maximise profits collusively by sacrificing true competition and efficiency within the banking industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The availability of funds for housing is another telling example. Housing portfolios are the least profitable of bankers' business. Historically the overwhelming majority of loans for housing have come from the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria. The building societies, particularly St George, are the next most important players, followed by a somewhat token performance from the private banks. Privatising half of the two major Australian home lenders is guaranteed to see a substantial reduction in the availability of funds for home lending-a tragedy not only for prospective home owners, but also for the beleaguered building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Bank was established in 1912 by a Labor government wishing to avoid having to go cap in hand to conservative thinking boards of the private banks to fund Labor projects and implement Labor's financial policies. A 49 per cent private holding in the bank must inevitably again lead to at least 50 per cent of the board's seats being filled by persons with a political viewpoint inimical to Labor and its traditional constituency. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals to create a competitive framework in the telecommunications industry are extremely complex, but fit within the principles I have enunciated already. There is no evidence to support the Cabinet's view that a competitive situation will produce better economic results than a national monopoly. On the contrary, the most efficient telecommunications systems in the world, with the lowest charges, are the monopolies of Scandinavia. The most competitive and efficient telecommunications industry is that recently nationalised by France which replaced a run-down, inefficient private enterprise system. The French now lead the world in research and development, and French exports are making serious inroads into the deregulated American and Japanese markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming overseas evidence is that the provision of a competitor to government monopolies results in cheaper calls for business but more expensive calls for ordinary consumers. The Government's decision to allow competition, but not a free market, in the sense that prices will be fixed and the competitors rigidly regulated, does nothing for efficiency or micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin, Aussat Pty Ltd is a debt ridden space relic that deserves to be sold. Further, there is no doubt that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations are likely to open up international calls to foreign competitors. Given that side of the equation, proposals to sell Aussat and allow full competition on overseas calls are sensible decisions. Equally sensible and consistent with micro-economic reform are proposals to utilise excess capacity on the local network created by optic fibre cables and allow wholesaling to air time resellers in the niche markets.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the delights of being elected to this Parliament is that my alumni includes the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). That honourable gentleman, already a guru of the New Right, is now carving himself a parliamentary reputation by delivering cute little tongue-in-cheek speeches tendering political wisdom and advice to the Labor Party. Last week in the adjournment debate he called on us to extinguish Chifley's light on the hill by rejecting all forms of public ownership as outmoded and useless. Has he really thought this through? The more Labor embraces the policies of Thatcher, the more it erodes the political base of the Liberals. The traditional Labor supporters, alienated by the rejection of the philosophy of Curtin and Chifley, will inexorably turn to the Democrats. The end result of the Costello plan would be Labor dominating the centre and a large portion of the right of the spectrum. The Democrats would represent the left, and his mob would be relegated to the extreme right with M. Penn in France. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the honourable member for Higgins can dream all he likes. The current neo-classical economic fixation of the Hawke Government is but a phase. Soon political pragmatism and relentless critical party rank and file will return Labor to the Keynesian policies of government intervention to achieve price level stability, output growth, full employment and a balance of payments equilibrium. The Labor leopard has not changed its spots-Cabinet has merely temporarily lost sight of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very interesting to follow on from the speech of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), who this evening has distinguished himself by giving a speech of no confidence in the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and indeed in the Government's Budget, which was brought down only a few weeks ago. It is fascinating to see how the Left is alive and well within the ranks of the Labor Party. That faction would have been somewhat swelled, I suspect, by the last election results. The other night I was sitting in here listening to some maiden speeches, including one given by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). I congratulate him on his maiden speech, which highlighted just how out of date the views of the left wing of the Australian Labor Party really are. But despite the views that those people hold, which are consistently being proven throughout the world today as being inappropriate and as having failed, the left wing of the Labor Party still has a strong influence, and indeed at times a dominant influence, within the Labor Party structure itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The speech of the honourable member for Robertson indicates to us that very shortly he hopes and, indeed, expects that the left wing views of the Labor Party will once again dominate the Budget process, the thinking of our Treasurer and so forth. Perhaps he may be proven to be right, and perhaps in the years to come when Labor sits back on the Opposition benches the Left may dominate. Indeed, from the speeches we have just heard from people such as the honourable member for Robertson I would think that the honourable member and some of his left wing colleagues would be happier on the Opposition benches. I am sure that, as a consequence of his speech, the honourable member for Robertson will not be on the Treasurer's Christmas card list this year. He will not be enjoying strong support from that gentleman. At least it has got his career in this House off to a notable start. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fascinating to look through the Budget that was brought down in this House only a few weeks ago. Many commentators who gave the Budget a quite critical analysis-for many of them it was their very first analysis of this Budget-gave it the thumbs down. I have noticed in my years in this House that, generally speaking, in the first few days following a Federal Budget there is widespread support from economic commentators throughout the land as they read the Government's prepared statements which highlight all the good things and ignore the bad things in the Budget. It then takes a week or two before analysis is gone into in some depth and people say-shock, horror-'Look what the Budget really does for us'. Then there is a fairly negative response. </PARA>
<PARA> It was fascinating to note that from the moment this Budget was announced the economic commentators virtually unanimously gave it a bad report card. Many of them said it was disappointing because in the next 2 years the Government had a golden opportunity to make some significant changes to the way in which the Australian economy is run. We all know that the political reality is that the best time to make the tough decisions in government is immediately after an election. One then has the time to watch those tough decisions resulting in plans coming to fruition and by the time the next election comes around the people who might initially have been opposed to the tough decisions can see the benefits of those tough decisions flowing through. </PARA>
<PARA> We all expected, and indeed hoped, that the Government would do the right thing and that we would see these tough decisions being implemented in the Treasurer's post-election Budget. But, unfortunately, the Treasurer got the jitters. He got a little bit wimpish and, as a consequence, this Budget provided no tough options whatsoever. Indeed, it avoided the difficult decisions and led a lot of people throughout this country to be further disappointed in the performance and direction of this Government and led them to question further the economic direction and credibility of our Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a time which requires tough decisions to be made. We have all heard-indeed, the honourable member for Robertson highlighted it in his comments-what a difficult time individual Australians are having at the moment. He referred to the difficulties of home buyers in affording their homes because of high interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are higher.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can apply the same high interest rate problems to people in small businesses who are currently suffering from record high interest rates and a record high level of bankruptcies. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) so aptly represents in this House, the farmers of Australia are also suffering from the same high interest rates which are plaguing small businessmen and home buyers. Farmers are experiencing some of the toughest times that they have seen in some years. The prospects for farmers look very grim indeed, particularly if one is in the wool industry or the wheat industry. They have very grim prospects at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of these things are being caused by the Government's deliberate policy of implementing high interest rates. The Treasurer, quite shamefacedly, says, 'We have introduced a high interest rate policy designed to bring the economy into gear, rein it in, so that we can control it properly because it got out of control, it was bubbling over, it was effervescent'-those were the words he used to use. In the process of trying to bring the economy under some sort of control I believe that the Treasurer has stepped one pace too far and is in the process of actually strangling the economy because, without any doubt whatsoever, Australia is at this present time moving into a recession. I do not think that any reasonable, well-balanced person would say that we are doing anything else but moving into a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> This of course poses a question with regard to the credibility of this Government's economic management. Normally, Australia has had to import its recessions. We have caught recessions as the rest of the world has caught them. In this particular instance Australia has caught its own recession. We are totally self-sufficient in creating recessions these days. That is a great claim that this Government can make; that is its great achievement. Despite relatively high commodity prices and a buoyant world economy over the last six or seven years, Australia's economy has been moving backwards. We are seeing an increase in unemployment and an increase in our balance of payments deficit-a shocking balance of payments deficit which is causing a great deal of concern throughout the community. We are seeing a massive increase in our foreign debt-an alarming increase of some 400 or 500 per cent in our foreign debt since the Labor Government came into power. We are seeing our level of competitiveness falling further and further each and every day, all under the administration of this Labor Government. We are finding that Australia can no longer hold its head up around the world as being one of the major economies; one of the best economies in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Our standard of living has, without any question, fallen. The average Australian now enjoys a standard of living that is considerably less than it was years ago. All of these things have been happening as a consequence of some very deliberate and we would tend to consider misguided economic policies of the Labor Government, some of which have been highlighted by people such as the honourable member for Robertson, who did so in the speech preceding mine. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all looking forward to some major changes to try to turn back the tide of this economic recession which is starting to sweep across the land. We are all looking forward to hearing the Government say, 'Right, now we have the chance. Now we know that we have a good reason to make changes. Let's go out and do it. Let's, for example, enter into privatisation which is a good thing, which is something that, despite the fact that we have opposed it, is something which can deliver real benefit to the average Australian'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been talking about privatisation but, in reality, it is not really talking about it seriously because the type of privatisation which the Government is talking about is the worst of all worlds. It is a half measure at very best. The type of privatisation that it talks of is 49 per cent of the sale of the shares of particular government business enterprises, such as Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> This poses the question: If privatisation is so good, as we have heard from people such as the Treasurer in the last few weeks-indeed even the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, tonight on the 7.30 Report was talking about the virtues of privatisation in an interview with Paul Lyneham-why do we not follow the trend that is going around the world today and sell off 100 per cent of the shares of these various government business enterprises? One has to ask oneself the fundamental question: What on earth are governments doing being involved in commercial activities such as running airlines, shipping lines, banks and so forth? These enterprises, by rights, should be in the private sector which traditionally has a better track record of providing more competitive services and better services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has created the expectation that privatisation would be introduced. Yet the Government has really gone only half way. Despite all of that, the Government's rhetoric acknowledges the merits of privatisation and, in the process, it has tried to make its privatisation look vastly different from the privatisation policies the coalition parties talked about in 1985. In 1985 the coalition parties were prepared to deliver in detail policies about how to privatise various government business enterprises, and indeed committed themselves to do so in 1985, five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years ago this Labor Government ridiculed those policies by describing them as outrageous, a neanderthal approach and vandalism of the grossest kind. It said, `This is shocking; we cannot possibly have this. The Labor Party supports the right of governments to own these business enterprises'. Of course, five years later, the Labor Party has finally recognised the merits of what we recognised five years ago. In the process, it is trying to say, somehow or another, that the Labor idea of privatisation is good and that the coalition idea of privatisation is bad. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparison fails to stand up to logical analysis. The facts are that privatisation is something this country desperately needs. The Government is currently engaging in a half-hearted attempt and, like a lot of half-hearted attempts, it will not succeed nearly to the full benefit of the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the Government talk about tariff reform, but we have seen the Government also hedge away from real tariff reform. In this Budget we thought there might have been an opportunity for the Government to engage in picking up the recommendations of the Garnaut report. Unfortunately, the Government has backed away again. Once again, had the Government picked up the recommendations of the Garnaut report, it would have taken a tough decision. Had the Government picked up those recommendations, in the long term it would have delivered real gains to the average Australian. It would have put the economy on a far sounder footing and it would have indeed created more employment and improved the standard of living of the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget, the Government makes some comment on telecommunications reform. However, once again, the Government is only talking of half-hearted reforms. Once again we have to wait for this Government to go to its political masters and seek their approval for its hoped-for reforms in the telecommunications industries. It begs the question: if this Government wants to make decisions, why is it that it has to go to the national executive of the Labor Party to have those decisions ratified before it can implement them?</PARA>
<PARA> In March this year, Australians went to the polls to elect a government. One should have thought that when that Government was elected, it would have gone about the business of governing. This Government appears unable to do so. It appears to run to its political masters every time it has a tough decision to make, and that is what we are waiting for now. We sit here waiting for the national executive of the Labor Party to tell the Government whether it can implement the sorts of things that it proposes to do or whether it cannot. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget delivered only a few short weeks ago, the Government once again claimed that one of its great justifications for micro-economic reform is what it is doing on the waterfront. When one cuts through the rhetoric and looks at the facts, one finds that the Government's so-called reforms of the waterfront are illusory; indeed, they are almost non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 June last year, the Government set itself the task of creating a 30 per cent increase in productivity on the Australian waterfront over the next three years. It set aside funds to provide redundancy payments to fulfil those increases in productivity on the Australian waterfront. If one looks through the Budget Papers delivered a few weeks ago, one discovers that the funds set aside last financial year to pay for productivity gains on the Australian waterfront have not been fully taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, less than 25 per cent of the budgeted funds which were to be paid out for productivity gains on the waterfront have actually been paid out. That tells us that the Australian waterfront and the Government's so-called reforms of it are moving at less than 25 per cent of the pace the Government expected. It could be suggested that the numbers of people who have actually left the waterfront under the Government's so-called reforms are less than the numbers of people who have been employed under the Government's employment programs for new waterfront labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months we have seen more people actually employed on the waterfront than made redundant. Surely that does not add up to anything like the sort of micro-economic reform that the Government's rhetoric would indicate is actually occurring on the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, if one also looks at the Budget Papers and the Shipping Industry Reform Authority and at the expended funds, as opposed to the budgeted funds, for productivity increases in the shipping industry, one finds that the pace of reform in the shipping industry is moving along at about 50 per cent of the pace the Government had anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing can be said for the towage industry; another area that the Government claims it is reforming. If one looks at the money actually expended compared to the money that was actually budgeted for, one finds that reform within the towage industry is moving along at about 50 per cent of the pace the Government indicated it would move along at. What it tells us is that when we entered the chamber on that fateful Tuesday evening a couple of weeks ago to listen to the Budget, the sorts of reforms that the Government claimed in its rhetoric that it was achieving have not been achieved. Indeed, a further analysis of the Budget Papers reveals that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The pace of micro-economic reform on the Australian waterfront and throughout our Australian shipping industry is absolutely a snail's pace. One should compare the types of reforms that we are having here in Australia to the types of reforms that we find are occurring around the world in places like New Zealand, where a Labor Government with a bit of backbone implemented reforms on the waterfront which have achieved a 100 per cent increase in productivity in 12 months. In April last year in the United Kingdom, the Government implemented reforms on its waterfront which led to a 65 per cent increase in productivity in the 12 month period following the introduction of those reforms. We now see in Italy major reforms of the waterfront currently under way. Indeed, in many other countries throughout the world, one will find governments implementing quite dramatic, sensational and very exciting reforms to their waterfronts, which would leave the Australian Government's expected increases of 30 per cent in productivity over three years in the dust. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government is doing here is pathetic. Whilst this Government may certainly be achieving some productivity gains on the waterfront, the rest of the world is achieving more and at a faster pace. As a consequence, Australia is falling further and further behind in the competitive stakes around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons there are so many problems in Australian society today is because we cannot compete well enough. We cannot compete because the Government we have here in Canberra is unable and does not have the courage to make the necessary decisions in order to bring Australia's economy up to the level of efficiencies of the rest of the world. As a consequence, our standard of living falls further and further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers also reveal that social welfare reform was not engaged in the manner in which many people had expected it would be. We certainly saw the first home owners scheme axed-a scheme which the Government accused the Opposition of being prepared to axe if it got into government. Of course, the Government turned around and did it after the election. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little benefit or incentive for the family in this Budget. There is very little incentive for people to go out there and save money. In this Budget the Government has broken many of the promises it made prior to the election. For example, it wrote to pensioners in February this year and promised them in writing that it would not introduce a $2.50 fee for prescriptions. What did the Government do in the Budget the other night? It introduced a $2.50 fee for prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the build-up to the elections in March this year, the Government wrote to the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association and said, `We are not going to privatise the Commonwealth Bank. It is only those neanderthals in the Opposition who would dare do that sort of economic vandalism'. That was another promise that was broken in the past few weeks when the Government stepped towards making some form of privatisation of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw in the Budget a Government that lacks the courage to take the necessary decisions to bring Australia into line with the rest of the world. The Government has failed to give us any hope of economic efficiency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday during Question Time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) waxed indignant about what he claimed was a slur on the Reserve Bank of Australia following questions from the Opposition which sought to elicit information which the Treasurer was unlikely to volunteer. The questions sought information specifically about the collapse of the Farrow Group and the losses incurred by the State Bank of Victoria and the subsequent acceptance of an offer from the Commonwealth Bank to buy the latter as a going concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Any involvement in these rather exceptional loss-making State-owned entities by the Treasurer or the Reserve Bank, and the timing of developments, was a legitimate line of inquiry to be pursued by a conscientious Opposition. Indeed, if we did not take up the matters queried, we might fairly be accused sooner or later of having failed to do our duty. That is especially so given the Treasurer's boast that he has only to pick up the phone to obtain the obedience of the Reserve Bank to his Government. That, incidentally, is probably the biggest slur ever on the Reserve Bank and its governors, although the truth of that boast has never been denied. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the several grounds for the questions asked last week was the entitlement of all taxpayers in general, and Victorians in particular, to know why they once again have to pick up the tab, involving more than a billion dollars, for the crass incompetence of the Victorian Government. The Commonwealth's involvement was clearly pertinent and could be negligent if events leading up to either debacle were known beforehand, from either direct contact or by way of information given to its admitted instrumentality, the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite proper questioning, the Treasurer cried `Slur', and then, as so often in the past, went on in answers to questions in a way which amounted to slurs on anyone or any entity who or which came readily to his tiny mind. This is pretty standard behaviour for the Treasurer and, of course, it comes as no surprise. It is par for the course. In his timeworn attempt to escape giving substantial replies, he could not resist saying by way of diversion that the principals of the Farrow Group were somehow associated with the Liberal Party or vice versa. The deceit was plain for all to see. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the honourable member laughing about? The deceit was plain for all to see. The Treasurer went about it by saying that the questions slurred and then indulged himself in doing just what he feigns is so offensive to him. The subeditors who highlighted the Treasurer's pompous preaching last Thursday were unanimous in ignoring the Treasurer's own slurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That treatment can be contrasted with the time when the rumblings about WA Inc. players, including Rothwells and Bond Corporation, were at their zenith and our courageous media almost totally ignored the indecently close relationship between them and the Australian Labor Party. The demise of some of the personalities in that reprehensible succession of events, including two State Premiers, has never been referred to by this Government, let alone the Treasurer. This is despite well-documented, scurrilous practices including those mentioned in the McCusker report. Not one word of condemnation have we heard. But these amount to just recent examples of the Treasurer's ability to get away with what he often and erroneously identifies as the misbehaviour and improper motives of anyone who dares to disagree with his prejudices. </PARA>
<PARA> He then, as a matter of form, proceeds to do the very thing he ascribes to others and more often than not gets away with it. Only today, he heaped his miserable scorn on the Business Council of Australia on some spurious pretext or other. In the past he has been happy enough to cite the BCA when those views coincided with his own, but it seems that hell hath no fury like this Treasurer's scorn. With or without media attention, it is not going to wash. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to address the problem of homelessness in the electorate of Adelaide and the need to support a peak body to coordinate the delivery of services to homeless people. The electorate of Adelaide contains the central business district which, like most large cities, contains a number of homeless people, probably between 300 and 500. In Adelaide, there are numerous services to house, feed and offer assistance to these people. It is not clear whether the homeless migrate towards the city because that is where they can find food and shelter or whether the services were set up there because of the large number of homeless already there-probably a combination of both.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since my election, I have made it my business to visit the various organisations in the city offering succour to the homeless. It has certainly been a very enlightening experience for me. Rarely have I met so many exceptionally dedicated and resourceful people and I would like to thank them fairly individually at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Adelaide Central Mission coordinates a number of programs for the needy. One suggestion recently put forward by it is home-based community care in the larger homes of South Australians who, like me, have found that since their children have left home they have been left with a number of vacant rooms. There is Sister Janet Mead from the Catholic Day Care Centre for Homeless People who organises meals and a soup run each evening, with which I have been able to assist. There is Saint Luke's Mission where I recently attended, with Commissioner Brian Burdekin, the opening of a new shelter for homeless youth, built with Commonwealth Government assistance. Paul Nicholas of the Wright Court Day Centre offers refuge and comfort for the neediest in the community and some entertainment. Sister Veronica of the Daughters of Charity runs the Hutt Street Centre, which feeds over 1,300 men and women each year. Two weeks ago I had the privilege of helping to serve 120 lunches there. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a number of other organisations like Westcare, which serves very healthy food; Anglican Community Services; Catholic Family Services; Christian Community Care Services; Offenders Aid and Rehabilitation Services; Seventh Day Adventist City Church Welfare Society; St Vincent de Paul Society; of course, the Salvation Army, and the Second Story. These all deserve special mention for their outstanding efforts and assistance to our fellow human beings who are in desperate need. I am continuing to make my way around this sector and unfortunately even six months has not been sufficient to encounter all the very worthy people. </PARA>
<PARA> As in other capital cities, some of these charities rely on government grants to remunerate their managers, but most of them are terribly understaffed and could not maintain their services without volunteers. There are two areas which have lacked attention because of these circumstances: first, research on the reasons and direction of homelessness; secondly, the need for a peak organisation to coordinate these multifarious activities. </PARA>
<PARA> I was surprised to learn from the representatives of the Department of Community Services and Health at a recent public hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which is investigating the funding of peak community services bodies, that there is no national coordinating body for older, itinerant, homeless people. I note here that there are national bodies catering for the specific problems of youth homelessness and for women's shelters. But the group being serviced in the central business district of Adelaide is made up largely of itinerant, unemployed, older men, although there are a few women. </PARA>
<PARA> I was also surprised to learn at the public hearing that the funding of peak bodies appears to have been an historic process whereby groups lobby the Government and, according to the interests that prevail on the day, are accepted or otherwise for government funding. This is a submissions-based process and it has resulted in some needs being ignored, I believe, while others are represented by a number of different organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The mature homeless, it seems to me, are presently inadequately represented at the resource coordinating level. A coordinating body could ensure that there was no unnecessary duplication of services by this large number of very worthy bodies, that those services were targeted and geographically dispersed, and that the sector was adequately funded as a whole. It could furthermore undertake research in the State capital cities, in particular, where the problem of homelessness appears to be concentrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Burdekin got the ball rolling in this respect with his very extensive and impressive research in 1988. But it is difficult now to provide the adequate well-targeted services that we need when we have not got specific scientific data on what our clients are doing there, whether the problem is growing, what problems they encounter, and how they can be best serviced. I hope our report will address some on these problems. In the meantime, I convey my good wishes to those people presently engaged in serving the interests of homeless people and the many volunteers who have stepped forward into this breach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of this House to a remarkable piece of theatrical illusion that is being performed. The main players in this scenario are the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). The name given to this theatrical farce is micro-economic reform but, like so many theatrical productions, what has unfolded here bears little relation to reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major performers appear to have adopted Plato's advice when he said, `I wonder if we could contrive some magnificent myth that would in itself carry conviction to the whole community'. The myth that the Government is creating here is that it is serious about micro-economic reform but the words spoken in this House about the Government's complete change of policy direction on privatisation-in itself an endorsement of the principles of privatisation the coalition was putting forward six years ago-are the creation of political illusion designed to convince the Australian community that this Government is serious about economic reform and is genuine in its desire to get this country back on an even keel. On the one hand we have the Prime Minister asserting that selling part of the Commonwealth Bank is okay but selling Telecom Australia is just not on. That is not micro-economic reform; that is political expediency. </PARA>
<PARA> Another drama being enacted here is the struggle between the Minister for conservation and the Minister for Resources. If finding the right balance between conservation and development were not such a serious topic, we could be forgiven for thinking we have been watching a comedy rather than a tragedy. It is about time that this Government started practising the principles of sustained development rather than merely mouthing the rhetoric of sustained development. In other words, it should stop the play acting and return to reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give just one example of how this question of sustainable development has become distorted beyond reason. In my own region of the central highlands of Victoria a strict code of forest practices applies to all coupes selected for logging. The actual decision-making process from when an area is first selected for potential suitability for logging to when ministerial approval is actually granted takes approximately 12 months. During this period all interested parties, including industry, environment and community groups, take part in this decision-making process. A valuable resource is then harvested but the tragedy is that not all is utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government, like this Government, is fearful of the word `pulp'. It regards it as a dirty word. The amount of waste left on most logging coupes is staggering and this very waste material left to rot on the forest floor in the central highlands area alone could earn the Australian Government millions of dollars in export earnings. On a coupe of around 40 hectares the waste left behind if pulped could bring in around $400,000 or up to $1.2 million in finished paper products. Instead, most of this waste material is burnt, adding to the problem of greenhouse. Where the waste material is left piled metres high on the ground, it makes it difficult for forest workers to replant, frequently resulting in injury, it blocks out the light and it hinders the growth of young trees. This is just a ridiculous waste of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> To add to this problem Bowater-Scott Ltd is currently importing eucalypt material for its Myrtleford plant, where similar material is being burned just kilometres away. The collection of residual round wood to replace imports is not the same as utilising native forests for woodchipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity exists now to increase local manufacture, reduce imports and increase State revenues, all without cutting down a single additional tree, simply by using the remains of trees already felled for timber milling. Surely this should be central to the goal of sustainable development. Surely it is about time some common sense was brought into this drama. I urge the Government to include economic as well as ecological consider- ations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I have the pleasure of hosting a special guest from my electorate of Bowman. His name is Daniel Philps and he is from the fine suburb of Alexandra Hills in the Redlands district, which I am very pleased to represent in this Parliament. He is a grade 12 student at the secondary school known as the Redlands Community College. Daniel, who is up in the gallery with my son, has visited Canberra today as a result of the fact that he won a competition which I ran last year. I was always very confident that I would be able to pay out on the prize, although we did have an election on 24 March. The prize was a visit to Canberra courtesy of yours truly and also a meeting with the environment Minister. There has been a change of environment Minister but he got to meet the new Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank the editors of the two local newspapers in my electorate who most kindly agreed to sponsor the event in the sense of making sure that there was a lot of publicity for it and who also published the winning entry, which belonged to Daniel Philps, in their respective newspapers. I want to thank in particular the editors of the two news- papers, Brian Hurst, from the Bayside Bulletin and Redlands Times and Mr Allan Watson from the Wynnum Herald. I want to thank them very much for their cooperation and assistance and congratulate them for their concern for the young people of my electorate of Bowman and for the general environment. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of his prize, as I said, I brought Daniel to Canberra. Today he had the pleasure of meeting with the Minister for the Environment, who spent some time with him. They went over some of the issues that he brought out in his own essay. </PARA>
<PARA> I conducted a survey among my constituents earlier this year well before the election, a survey to which I am very proud to say some 15 per cent responded although I did not have the facilities to send a stamped addressed envelope. Out of that a very big percentage, some 25 per cent, named the environment as No. 1 on their major lists of concerns and said it was the most important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of my electorate is bounded by Moreton Bay so the issues of sensible development and the destruction of our sensitive wetlands are particularly important. In his winning essay Daniel discussed the need for development which takes account of the highly sensitive nature of mangrove and seagrass bed ecosystems. He pointed out that canal developments needed to be carefully planned so that any damage to the environment was mini- mised. In my electorate I am not all that happy to say there have been probably too many canal developments, one of which is really a blight on the landscape in what was one of the best areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Daniel highlighted the fact that Redlands still has large tracts of undeveloped land which is a natural habitat for a large range of native animals. He particularly emphasised the need to preserve areas of natural habitat for koalas in our district. Koalas have been plentiful on the Bayside but increasing urban pressures are destroying their natural habitats. A couple of them live in my yard so I have my own home-grown koalas. Daniel also emphasised the need for careful planning as the Brisbane metropolis expands outwards, putting ever increasing pressure on the delicate ecological balance of the Bayside. </PARA>
<PARA> Daniel is particularly lucky to be a student of the Redlands Community College. The College is only one of three such secondary schools in Queensland and is one of the best schools of the Bayside district. I have first-hand knowledge of the school because my daughter Zina was one of the first students and my wife conducted an English course there part time. She enjoyed it very much. The principal of the school, Dr David Warner, is an excellent educator and administrator who is regarded very highly in the Redlands area and in the whole of Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The school is very heavily community-minded. It gets itself involved in Skillshare programs and all sorts of community activities and is one of those fine schools and fine establishments that I hope will continue as a concept for many years to come. Tomorrow Daniel will go to the Australian National University; he wants to have a look at their law courses. He will also go to the usual places like the Australian National Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to congratulate Daniel for his excellent essay. It was a deserving winner. I am sure with young people like Daniel we will not have much trouble in preserving our environment, which is something our opponents over there always talk about but never do anything about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I applaud some of the decisions made by the Government to reform the welfare sector. It was very courageous of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to risk the wrath of the loony left by grasping the nettle and making the first tentative steps towards injecting some sort of rationale into welfare spending. For too long the necessity for higher welfare expenditure has been considered by the crusty old adherents to the Labor Party platform as being some self-evident truth, a truth that remains unshakeable in the face of mounting evidence of abuses in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously, the shock of making such a radical departure from the secure confines of that happily redundant socialist notion of the welfare state has induced an addled state of consciousness in the Minister responsible. An example of this may be seen in recent changes made to the funding of aged hostel care. These changes are made remarkable only by the lack of planning and forethought that seems to have gone into them. Under new funding arrangements aged hostels receive $2.40 per patient per day for unspecialised care and $19 per patient per day for those who require personalised care. Those subsidies are reserved for those classed as financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> To be financially disadvantaged one must have assets that are valued at less than 2 times the single pension per year. In other words, one's assets must be worth less than $18,365. If one's assets surpass this amount in value then the hostel at which one resides is not entitled to a subsidy on one's behalf. As honourable members may appreciate, $18,000 is not a substantial sum of money and consequently many hostels are deprived of subsidies for a number of their patients. For smaller hostels this can only have a crippling effect on their overall funding, forcing many to lay off staff and curtail services. Some hostels are being forced to move their patients to nursing homes while others are being confronted with the prospect of closure. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, in adopting these measures the Government has undoubtedly been motivated by the praiseworthy desire to curtail expenditure in the welfare sector. Indeed, we in the Opposition applaud any move towards rationalising the welfare sector. It is then very sad to note the incompetence and lack of judgment that form the backdrop to the Government's decision to limit the subsidies paid to hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular measure seems to me to be anything but rational. As I stated earlier, by limiting the funds made available to the smaller hostels the Government is forcing them to move their patients to nursing homes where the Government pays a subsidy of $55 per patient per day. One does not have to be Albert Einstein to calculate the extra cost to the Government of this measure, not to mention the trauma and upset which the move causes to the patients involved. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide a more specific example of the added cost of the measure I shall use the example of Jacaranda Lodge in my electorate where nine residents who were receiving $2.50 per day from the Government have been forced to move to nursing homes because they were not considered to be financially disadvantaged. This has meant that the hostel has lost $8,212.50 in funding per annum-$8,212.50 that was vital in a tight budget for the maintenance of essential staffing and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The move to a nursing home has meant that the Government is now paying $55 per patient per day for those nine patients. Projected annually, the Government is now paying $180,675 for those patients alone. That is a substantially larger cost than that originally borne by the Government. If we are going to see these much needed costs applied to the welfare sector, let us at least see them being conceived sensibly and rationally. As far as I can see, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has provided the Minister with an ultimatum to cut the expenditure of his Department. The Minister has responded by leaping in, making cuts hither and thither, with little thought to the cost in both human and financial terms. </PARA>
<PARA> If anything, we may derive from this one example the absurd farce that really is the Government's whole commitment to curtailing expenditure. It is ill-conceived and incompetently implemented. Ironically, the cost of the service is more expensive to the taxpayer as a result of the cuts. In the case of the Jacaranda Lodge in my electorate, by saving one stitch the Government has cost the taxpayer nine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the House a matter of concern. That concern is the decision made last Friday by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) management to cut local input into ABC regional programs in New South Wales. A few years ago I recall that in Wollongong we had a nightly ABC television program which provided five minutes of local news and was broadcast just before the national news. This was cut a few years back. At that time we were assured that we would get a better news service. We were told that we would get a State-wide news service and there would be segments of local news in that service. I do not know what happened to it but we have no ABC local news service. It is certainly not a State-wide one. There is no local segment in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are well served in the Illawarra by the local radio station, 2WN. It provides an excellent service. I was very concerned to learn on Friday that the ABC management had made a decision again to cut local input. We are very fortunate that on a Saturday morning we have a two-hour arts and jazz program. This is a very popular program. It is conducted by a woman named Kate Peters. It just so happens that at the very time that this decision by the ABC management to cut this program is being made, Kate Peters is in Italy accepting an international award for her work in radio. The ABC management has now decided to cut this program. One can understand if it were to save huge amounts of money. Spread over the six regional ABC stations in New South Wales, the ABC will save the monumental sum of $9,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey was carried out before this decision was made to find out what people wanted on the ABC. Eleven per cent of listeners said they wanted more sport while 21 per cent of listeners said they wanted less sport. If there is one thing that the ABC, especially in regional areas, provides a lot of, it is sport. I must not offend my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) by knocking sport; I would not do that. The ABC does provide a very extensive coverage of sport. The jazz and arts program which can be seen for two hours on a Saturday morning is going to be replaced by a national network sports program called Grandstand. </PARA>
<PARA> One could understand a little if there was going to be a local sports program-for instance, details of local sporting teams and interviews with players and officials-but this is going to be a national program. I would suggest that with the exception of Wayne Gardner, the Illawarra Steelers and maybe our basketball team, the Hawks, the Illawarra will not get much of a mention on that national program. </PARA>
<PARA> Kate Peters' program was a local program. It was devoted to what was happening locally in the jazz and arts scene. It went for two hours on a Saturday morning. It was a very popular program. It will be cut as part of an ABC cost cutting measure. I appeal to the ABC to stop decimating local radio in New South Wales. I appeal especially to the Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Hill, to think again about this decision and to keep local input. It is very important. As I said before, we were all assured when our local news program was cut that we would get a better service. Our better service today is no service at all. That is what is going to happen in ABC radio. Eventually the regional stations will be replaced with a network program and we will lose that very important local input. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An overall shortage of the 1990 influenza vaccine has been experienced even though the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) produced significantly more vaccine than it did for the previous year and over 60% more vaccine was available for distribution than in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> The shortage has resulted from an unprecedented demand for the vaccine which stemmed from media coverage of the recent Northern Hemisphere influenza experience.</PARA>
<PARA> All sections of the community increased their demand for the vaccine but the most substantial increase was noted in the category of those at least risk from influenza.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In common with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, CSL distributes its vaccine to wholesalers and public hospitals. It has no control over the subsequent steps of distribution from wholesalers.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I understand that CSL has already entered into discussion regarding the distribution of the vaccine with representatives of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the AMA.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There are no plans to remove the influenza vaccine from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme next year.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Will Australia publicly lend its support to the protests to Indonesia by the PNG Foreign Minister, Mr Michael Somare, as reported by AFP on 14 August 1990, regarding Indonesian military incursions into PNG territory and infringements of PNG sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Did the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Philip Flood, discuss these military incursions while on his recent visit to Irian Jaya.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports of the level of military activity on the border; if so, will Australia convey to the PNG Government, in the strongest terms, its concerns that refugees in the Yapsie area be permitted to stay in PNG at least until the situation in Irian Jaya improves and the safe return of the refugees is completely guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Is the Minister able to state the (a) whereabouts and (b) present condition of the OPM leader Melkianus Salosa who was recently forcibly deported to Indonesia by the PNG Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Has Salosa been granted any access to independent legal or non-government organisation representatives in a position to monitor his rights in his present situation of detention and alleged intense interrogation.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Is the Minister able to state whether Salosa's forced repatriation was legally well-founded and it complied with Papua New Guinea's obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Does the Minister have any information as to the (a) whereabouts, (b) living conditions, and (c) legal status of the seven Melanesian Irian Jayans who sought asylum in the PNG Consulate, Jayapura, on 14 December 1989, and who were subsequently handed over to the Indonesian authorities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of press reports of recent Indonesian incursions into PNG territory. The Australian government has not commented on these, believing that the management of their joint border is a matter for Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to work out in cooperation with each other.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian government was not asked to associate itself with Sir Michael Somare's protest of 14 August calling on Indonesia to respect the territorial integrity of Papua New Guinea. It does not plan to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Ambassador discussed developments along the Indonesian-PNG border with Indonesian officials during his recent visit to Irian Jaya.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The latest information available to me is that the UNHCR office in Papua New Guinea, with the cooperation of the PNG government, plans to move refugees from Yapsie to the refugee camp further south at East Awin.</PARA>
<PARA> (5-6) According to my most recent information, the questioning of Melky Salosa has been completed. I understand that he is being held in Jayapura.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have no information to indicate that the deportation of Salosa was not legally well founded. Salosa did not have refugee status. His extradition was sought by the Indonesian government for his alleged involvement in an attack on a transmigration camp in Irian Jaya which resulted in the death of a large number of civilians. Salosa was arrested in Papua New Guinea in December last year for the illegal possession of weapons. Before his deportation he was appearing before a PNG court on a charge of illegal entry. I believe that Papua New Guinea's deportation of Salosa did not contravene its obligations as a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Refugees.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) My latest information about the four Irianese who sought asylum in the PNG consulate in Jayapura in December last year is that all four were brought to trial in June on a count of subversion. I understand that all have received sentences of between twelve and eighteen years imprisonment. Staff from the ICRC have had access to the detainees.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The Australian government through the Australian Embassy in Jakarta has continued to monitor the situation of the four Irianese who sought asylum.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) I understand that in early August the Indonesian Armed Forces in Jayapura announced the capture of 11 suspected OPM members. They are reportedly being questioned by the security authorities prior to their trial.</PARA>
