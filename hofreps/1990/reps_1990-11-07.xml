<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four years ago the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure inquiry into Commonwealth assistance to the arts, known as the McLeay report, which dealt with the operations of the Australia Council, was tabled in the Parliament. The Government responded to the recommendations of that report 3 1/2 years ago. The Australia Council Amendment Bill appeared first in mid-1988. It lapsed with the March 1990 election and once again it is before us now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill has two major purposes. The first is to clarify the right of the Minister to give written direction to the Australia Council on any matter except for the making of individual grants. The Council's independence in this regard will remain although the Minister will still be entitled to inform the Council of his own wishes in particular cases. Secondly, the Bill will oblige the Australia Council to have regard to Commonwealth policies and, where practicable, to the policies of State and local governments as they relate to the arts. In this regard the Australia Council will be able to give details of such directions in its annual report, and the Opposition certainly supports that. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are some other changes as well. While the size of the Council remains unchanged at 10 to 14, the chairpersons of all boards are to become ex officio members of the Council. There is a requirement for two government nominees of the Council to be dropped and provision made for the appointment of two representatives of community interests. The maximum number of members on each board is raised to nine from eight and the minimum number reduced from six to five. There is to be a special coordinating board which may comprise the chairman and members of the Council, board members and members representing the community and arts practitioners. Its role is to advise on community cultural development and it will have a maximum of 13 members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has some difficulty with this Bill. We believe these changes will lead to an even greater bureaucratisation of the Australia Council. We also believe that the Bill really does not resolve the major issues relating to the federal funding of the arts in Australia. This Bill does not address, for example, the need to establish clear lines of responsibility in arts funding to avoid duplication of Federal, State and local government funding. While the Fraser Government removed the Australian Opera, the Australian Ballet and the Elizabethan Theatre Trust from bureaucratic control, other mainstream national arts bodies are still bound by that control, even with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is also totally opposed to the misuse of arts funding for blatant political purposes, particularly through the art in working life program and direct grants to the trade unions. I will refer to that a little later. We do not believe that the Australia Council should be used as a way of funding the mainstream arts. We believe that there is certainly an opportunity of taking the mainstream companies out of the Australia Council because these companies are perfectly capable of administering themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the Australia Council could well be involved in the administration of grants to smaller bodies but certainly under strict government guidelines. Obviously we believe that the Australia Council should be at arms length and should be a non-political organisation instead of the clearly political operation it is now. We would, for example, not continue the art in working life program under its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite some examples. As recently as August this year workers at a Sydney building site were enthralled by a theatre performance focusing on what the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia believes will be the effect of the Greiner Government's labour market deregulation and industrial relations legislation. That performance-during working hours, I might add-was funded by a $24,000 grant from the Australia Council. Not to be denied, the South Australian builders' labourers were earlier this year entertained by their union's federal-funded poet in residence, and that was funded by a $26,000 community writers fellowship. The poet, a Mr Geoff Goodfellow, gave poetry recitals to workers on a number of sites in Adelaide. That event, widely reported at the time, drew a great deal of media attention-and is it any wonder? I can only concur with the blunt comments of one of the workers who is reported at the time in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying that the event was `crap' and `a waste of time and a waste of money'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not too long ago that the coalition Waste Watch Committee exposed some of the blatant, irresponsible and pointless grants by the Australia Council to projects whose importance in terms of micro-economic reform and fiscal constraint have to be questioned. I am sure most honourable members will remember the grant of $11,000 to Wild Women Surfboards for the development of surfboards especially designed for women, and grants such as the $52,000 paid to the deregistered Builders Labourers Federation for artists and muralists, and $8,272 to the Food Preservers Union for leadlight and ceramics classes-and the list goes on. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MH4">Mr JULL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can refer to the biography and the translation into Japanese. Quite frankly, the public of this country have every right to expect that the taxes they pay to the Federal Government be used judiciously, and at the time of that Waste Watch Committee there was understandable public disgust at the revelations concerning this Government's abuse of public funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to look back at the response. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), interviewed at the time on 2GB, tried very badly for almost an hour to defend these extravagances, eventually having to concede that many of his Government's grants had really been indefensible silliness. He called on his Ministers-apparently forgetting that some of the most absurd grants had come through his own Department-to exercise greater supervision. Has that really happened? The answer is no. We have only to look at the 1988-89 annual report of the Australia Council to see where the public money goes. We learn that a great deal of it is going directly to the union movement and to the trades and labour councils in various regions throughout Australia. Writers Against Nuclear Arms and the Australian Feminist Book Fortnight still feature as recipients of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> While we in the Opposition have no objection to the funding of the arts in Australia, we do take exception to the way in which grants through the Australia Council are made to various theatre and visual arts organisations whose objectives are blatantly political and which use the arts as a medium for pro-government propaganda. We have to say that the response by the Government to this issue has been abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA> We would not want to be completely negative in terms of the art in working life program. The Opposition believes that there could well be a role for an art in the workplace program, such as concerts in the workplace or on building sites, but during lunch breaks, not as unauthorised stopwork meetings. Under the Opposition's program there will be no Federal funding for people to go to what are effectively stopwork meetings, to read poems which are often not much more than an incitement to undertake a bit of boss bashing under the guise of cultural activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is reviewing its arts policy. We believe the arts have been politicised in a most intolerable way. We believe there is a role for the Australia Council, but it will be in a form which is very different from the way it exists today. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was; that is why I was making notes. Let me respond to a couple of those remarks and then I will go on to something with a great deal more substance. It seems to me, as part of this debate on the Australia Council Amendment Bill, that the Opposition says it is unhappy with some of the things which are supported by the Australia Council; specifically, that various trade unions are funded to represent their wares to the workers, if you like, or to represent the condition of workers to the work force. If the Opposition wants arms length funding from the Australia Council, it must be remembered that the Australia Council has this role of distributing funding to the arts for the Commonwealth Government. So on the one hand the Opposition wants to control and criticise the way in which the Australia Council spends its money, but on the other hand it would also like to have this arms length approach whereby it says that the Australia Council should make up its own mind about who it funds. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It should either stand back and let the Australia Council decide, within the broad confines of the Commonwealth Government's dictates, or it should be happy that the Australia Council is getting on with the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would criticise the demonstration in the work place of those things important to workers as part of art. Are members of the Opposition so worried about that that they would rather spend all their money on the Australian Opera? High culture is something that members opposite probably enjoy and love, but most people in the community do not see the benefit or the necessity of it. The fact that we encourage and delight in the fact that the Australia Council bothers to give money to those artists who can display and demonstrate to workers in their work place-their very day to day lives-through artistic means is good. I think it is a marvellous way to bring the arts to the people. It is something that we on this side of the House have always wanted the Australia Council to do. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition is really fair dinkum about arm's lengths funding-that is, allowing the Australia Council to make up its own mind about to whom it gives money-it is a bit difficult at the same time to criticise the particular allocations of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let me come back to the Bill and the McLeay report and then make some other comments about the current work of the Australia Council that I am intrigued by and supportive of. There are four main themes in the changes to the Australia Council Act, many of which arise out of a report called Patronage, Power and the Muse-Inquiry into Commonwealth Assistance to the Arts which the present Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay), chaired. The conclusion of that report was essentially as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>This report has shown that Commonwealth arts support goes far beyond the Australia Council's highly visible but relatively small budget. The need for better co-ordination, more open setting of priorities and greater public accountability of the varied Commonwealth culture interventions is the most important theme of this report. The Committee acknowledges that the development of unco-ordinated and largely unaccountable public investment in culture over the last 15 years has had some impressive successes to balance its occasional failures. We argue, however, that the development phase is over and that consolidation is overdue.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes to this question of consolidation. That is the essence of the Government's response which is now reflected in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The responses are basically as follows. We are addressing, as the honourable member for Fadden said in raising the issue, that matter of coordination of what Federal, State and local government would wish to do in the arts. We cannot do it in an overall and thorough-going way by simply taking over the field. The Australia Council basically distributes Commonwealth money. We cannot wish away the needs of State and local governments and their priorities for funding, but we do at least say in this legislation that the Australia Council should have regard to Commonwealth, State and local government wishes.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the first major point is to avoid duplication and to ensure that Commonwealth policies are taken into account in the grant giving process. A new section will oblige the Council to have regard to Commonwealth Government policies and, where practicable, to the policies of State and local governments as they relate to the arts. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step is then to distinguish how much regard the Council should have for the wishes of governments. Here we distinguish quite clearly between matters of policy in which the Australia Council must follow the Government and matters of actual allocation of money. We reaffirm here the policy of arm's length funding. The Australia Council should have the freedom to make up its own mind and be able, within the broad realms of the Government's policies, to distribute money to particular groups, be it for trade unions and trade union performances or for any other form of art and culture. </PARA>
<PARA> A clause headed `Directions by Minister' is now included, and it allows the power of ministerial direction to the Council. It is intended to assist in ensuring that the Council is in no doubt as to the Government's intentions and expectations with regard to the policies which are to guide its operations. The next step down, of course, is that the power of direction is not to apply to decisions on individual grants, which means that the principle of arms length funding is very firmly set within this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The final new elements of the Bill which specifically come out of the McLeay report are, first, a consolidation of the various boards that now operate within the Council, of which there are now five, coming down from about eight. They are the Literary Arts Board, the Visual Arts-Craft Board, the Performing Arts Board, the Aboriginal Arts Board and the Design Board. I will make some comments about the Design Board in a minute. In addition, the McLeay report specified that there should be some form of community input into the Council, and this Bill faithfully reflects that view and establishes a Community Cultural Development Board. </PARA>
<PARA> I pick up that theme, because the McLeay report emphasised that we really need some community decision makers to assist in this business of the allocation of arts funding. At the same time, though, the Arts Council and the arts and intellectual community, putting it at its broadest, are also trying to reach out and build bridges to the community as a whole. So two interesting events are happening here. One, reflected in this legislation, is the fact that we should build in some community decision making on the question of arts funding. The second arises from some interesting work that the Australia Council itself has undertaken, which we have heard about under the guise of the National Ideas Summit. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise some of the things that arose out of the National Ideas Summit held earlier this year because, in essence, this is an attempt by Donald Horne, the Chair of the Australia Council, to build some stronger bridges between the arts and intellectual community on the one hand and the broader Australian community on the other, which I applaud. I think it really intensifies and makes more relevant the sort of discussion that we are having around this Bill. I pick up a couple of points that Donald Horne made in his introductory remarks to the National Ideas Summit. He reminds us that intellectuals in this country are often seen to be a non-contributing part of society and berates us for having those points of view. He defines `intellectual' very broadly and makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps we should stop being afraid of using that word to describe all of those people, whether scientists or artists, scholars or popularisers, journalists or educators whose special realm is the development, circulation and criticism of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>He makes a delightful point when he says:</PARA>
<PARA>We need a reshaping of myths. As well as The Man From Snowy River we need The person from the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA>So Donald Horne is trying to tell us that we have a great resource of artistic, cultural and intellectual people who themselves need to demonstrate their relevance to the Australian community. If Donald Horne and the Australia Council, which is basically this arts funding body, can build those bridges between all the characters that it has contact with and the broader community, then I applaud it. If this Bill, which will be passed in the near future, can assist in achieving that, I think that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I just run through some of the comments made by a number of other people in order to pick up the flavour. Dr Peter Ellyard, the Director of the Commission for the Future, was also trying to help to build this bridge. The Commission for the Future is specifically studying the question of artistic creativity and its relationship to economic prosperity. That comes as a bolt from the blue, in a sense, to most of the Australian community, who I assume would say that artists and intellectuals are basically a burden on the community, that they do not necessarily contribute but cost a great deal. It is up to the artistic and intellectual community to overturn that very ignorant position. In fact, they contribute massively, but they have to demonstrate in concrete ways that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> By means of a more concrete contribution, a paper was given by John Boorne, AM, businessman and chairman of the steering committee for the Australian Academy of Design. I mentioned before that one of the boards of the Australia Council is the Design Board. I was quite intrigued and thrilled by his contribution. What he is saying is that the whole area of design can make a significant contribution to lifting Australian living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> He makes the following points, if I can follow through his paper: design must better serve the current needs of industry and the environment. It must cease to be an abstraction and be viewed as a valuable strategic tool, and he goes on to work out ways of achieving that. The first essential is to marshall the design resources in Australia and to marshall financial support. Here is where he makes the real connections: he talks about the National Industry Extension Service of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, which was established back in 1986. The unique relationship here is that the National Industry Extension Service joined with members of the Design Board within the Australia Council and established in time the Australian Academy of Design. The essential element here is that the new committee, the Design Committee, represented such diverse interests as design in fashion, textile, graphic arts, engineering, landscape architecture, architects' industrial interior and the performing arts. The two groups, those from the National Industry Extension Service and the Australia Council, formed the National Design Forum.</PARA>
<PARA> So that here in a very real sense one element of the Australia Council is building a specific and very concrete bridge between design, artistic people and Australian industry, and it is doing it as part of the work of the Design Board of the Australia Council. John Boorne makes further points: what he wants to do with this group is to concentrate on customer needs, products and environment and on quality and design and on original ideas and not slavishly follow the ideas imported from elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> So John Boorne, businessman, as part of the Australia Council, is helping to take the best design and creative people in this country, and the Australia Council gives him an entree into those people, and then allow their skills to be directly applied to the industrial process. Out of that, he is really doing what all of us have made speeches on: trying to get this country to make different products of substantial value that can be exported. So I am extremely pleased that some people in this country are bright enough to take two apparently divorced areas of society, industry and culture, and bring them together and actually make the arts a productive element of industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the Australia Council and Donald Horne for instigating these sorts of processes, but it does not just occur within the Design Board; there is a second area of work which I will run across quickly. A paper produced out of the original National Ideas Summit was one entitled Unlocking the Academies. Here is an attempt to address the question of how these creative and intelligent individuals who mainly work away at universities can make a contribution to the broader society. I have no doubt that they have always made a significant contribution, and I have always argued that they are very poorly paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, Donald Horne does not sit back and rub his hands and say, `It is all too difficult; we do not get paid enough; we are not cared for by the broader society'. Instead he has said, `Why do we not, as academics, learn to speak with the rest of the community, to write in intelligible English so people may understand what we have to say'. In this case the Australia Council is sponsoring people who sit in academic institutions to step outside and speak directly with the community, and I applaud that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will speak very briefly on some of the ways in which bridges can be built between the academic community and the broader Australian society. There is a great deal of concentration on having academics-and I am comfortable with the word, although I know it is often used in this country as a term of criticism-write more clearly and communicate more readily with the broader Australian community. The discussion paper comes up with a number of things that might happen. Although this is an old idea, we are still working away at it. Under the heading `Career Mobility and Extension of Experience' the paper says:</PARA>
<PARA>Opportunities should be provided for academics to gain outside experience without penalty on return to their university. </PARA>
<PARA>Expansion of programs which bring visiting teachers from the general intellectual community to universities would help in extending the intellectual vigour and social awareness of academia. </PARA>
<PARA>Movement in either direction should not be too short term and not isolated to a small group of disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA>One recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA>Portable superannuation should be introduced, to encourage movement between academia and the outside community in both directions. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope-and I am sure Donald Horne and those who delivered this paper would understand-that the Australian Government has already produced the sort of flexibility that enables people to move in and out of academic institutions carrying their superannuation. What is needed is significant numbers of people in industry and in the public sector wanting to go into universities or university people wanting come out. </PARA>
<PARA> It has struck me that now we are reading material which states there will not be enough academics to teach in our institutions over the next decade, but at the time when I was going through university in the early 1970s the headlines were different. The headlines then were that we had too many academics who were stuck in fixed positions and that the new, bright generation of would-be academics, apprentice academics, could not get into positions because they were all tied up. In a way that was not a bad thing because there were probably hundreds of thousands of very bright people who did not stay in academia, who went directly into industry and government, and are now using their skills and intellect directly in government. It is at this time that the Australia Council wants to generate more interaction between some of the most creative people in this country and industry and government. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Bill and I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your work in chairing that Committee some time ago. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the two speakers in this debate, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), for their comments. I am pleased that the Opposition is supporting the Australia Council Amendment Bill which is before the House. Mr Speaker, given your past involvement with the former powerful and influential House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, of which the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) was also a member at some stage, you must take particular satisfaction in seeing the work of that Committee coming through in this form here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make some points on the comments of the honourable member for Fadden during his contribution. He raised the question of the Commonwealth-State relationship and funding. On 26 May this year the Cultural Ministers Council-the group of Commonwealth and State Ministers for the arts-met in Rotorua, and this whole question of the broad framework of the arts and the way in which it should be funded was discussed. The meeting was very productive and, indeed, considerable progress was made towards a clear understanding of, if not necessarily clear divisions between, the way in which the arts are funded in this country at the three levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> No firm decision was reached at that stage because both the States and the Commonwealth rightly pointed to the fact that local government has a very important role and obviously we would be looking for their input. By the time of the next meeting of the Cultural Ministers Council in May 1991 we would hope to be in a position where this question of the relationship between the three tiers of government and the funding of the arts can be looked at in a fairly constructive way. At that meeting there was also a unanimous call for support for the Australia Council. I think that is worth putting on the record and again an indication, I guess, of the maturity and forward thinking of that particular organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the other points that were raised. I noticed that in his contribution the honourable member for Fadden talked about the Opposition being in the process of reworking its arts policy. The Opposition believes that while there is a role for the Australia Council it would support the Australia Council in a markedly different form from its current set-up. If that is the case, I would congratulate the Opposition on at least taking a forward step because it went into the recent election with a policy to abolish the Australia Council and to set up in its place a series of advisory boards that would be responsible to the Minister. Those boards would be made up of representatives from the States and arts consumers. I think we on this side of the House would have some difficulty with that notion; indeed, the arts community generally would have a great deal of difficulty with that particular approach. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe very strongly, as the honourable member for Petrie pointed out in his contribution, in the principle of arms-length funding for the arts within this community. Even if we did abolish the Australia Council we would still need to establish some form of bureaucracy, some form of organisation, that would deal with the countless thousands-upwards of 7,000-grant applications per year. Any sort of saving would be perceived rather than real. I hope that in its deliberations on its arts policy, the Opposition will take a much more constructive approach to the funding of the arts on that principle of arms-length funding, a principle that has been supported right across the political spectrum for many years now. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fadden also made reference to the art in working life program and identified what it regarded as some elements of waste identified by its Waste Watch Committee in terms of some of the grants that were made. I find it strange that this committee in the past has often been very critical of grants that have been made to ordinary working people through the organised trade union movement of this country or to other groups in the community which are not part of what we may consider to be the mainstream sector of the community. The provision of grants through the trade union movement in my view is a very sensible approach and is a very good approach in the administrative sense as well. The union movement in this country is capable of reaching some three million people or about half the work force and clearly there are some significant benefits, in an arts sense, through that process. The unions themselves make a considerable input into that process as well, meeting the administration costs of those arts programs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that in the course of this debate, which has raged from time to time over the last few years, the Opposition has conveniently overlooked the fact that this particular program-which, I might say, contributes less than 2 per cent of the Council's annual Budget-was actually established in 1982-83 and I am sure that most members of this House would realise the political significance of that time; in other words, it was established during the time of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that we constantly get these references to the work of the arts in working life program because often the criticisms are made for a very cheap political purpose. They are often capable of achieving a quick headline, but they often also ignore the positive benefits that I think can flow from those sorts of programs. The production of plays and the production of banners, posters and murals provides an opportunity on the work site for many in the community and the trade union movement who would never otherwise be able to participate in the arts because they see the arts as being very remote from them. Obviously this program also provides a source of income for a lot of actors and the arts community in general. So I think there are positive benefits to be gained from it. I have also been told that many employers are very supportive of that program because, if nothing else, it manages to keep the work force on site during their lunch hour while they are being entertained and enjoying their lunch. There are a whole range of benefits that the arts in working life program can bring. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to detain the House any longer. I conclude by thanking the Opposition for its support of this Bill. It does have a very long history and I know that its passage through this House and hopefully through the Senate will be very much welcomed by the Australia Council. </PARA>

<PARA> I will speak firstly on the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill. This Bill sets the charges for the subsidised overseas students scheme which the Government commenced phasing out at the beginning of this year. Whilst new students are now covered by a full fee and scholarship program, a number of students are still in the system who are still covered by the old scheme. It is for these students that these charges are being set. </PARA>
<PARA> The fees in this Bill for higher education and technical and further education colleges are set as a proportion of the costs of a student place to the Federal Government, as has been the case in previous years. The fee for secondary students is an amount indexed by the consumer price index. The coalition has no objection to the fees set in this Bill and will thus not be opposing it. The coalition, however, wishes to register its objection to what is a blatant breach of faith on the part of the Government with respect to the implementation of the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As I noted, the new scheme involves overseas students paying full fees for places at Australian institutions. When the Government moved from a subsidisation scheme to a full fees scholarship scheme, it informed tertiary institutions that they could no longer count overseas students as part of their student load for the determination of Federal Government funding. The significance of this instruction for university finances would be apparent to all, and it was certainly apparent to the Federal Government. Indeed, it has been estimated by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee that the loss of revenue was to total $65m by 1992. The Government therefore gave tertiary institutions an undertaking. The policy change was sold to institutions in the following terms. I quote from a joint media release issued on 18 December 1988 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA>The institutions themselves will benefit from the abolition of the subsidised program which will no longer attract students away from the full fee program. Losses to revenue arising from the phasing out of the existing subsidised system will be offset by direct revenue accruing from the new scholarship places.</PARA>
<PARA>Several weeks earlier, in a speech to the Department of Employment, Education and Training International Development Program Seminar on Offshore Education, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade had foreshadowed this commitment when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>While the new scholarships would be a different form of expenditure in the higher education sector, I would expect there would be no reduction in the volume of that expenditure. The essence of the change would be a different kind of commitment to overseas students in Australia, not a lesser commitment.</PARA>
<PARA>These statements are particularly significant. In public statements and privately, the Government gave tertiary institutions an explicit commitment that the new scheme would be strictly revenue neutral in terms of the effect on their budgets. The funds they would lose from no longer being allowed to count overseas students in their total student load would be balanced by the scholarships which would be awarded to students attending these institutions, scholarships such as the equity and merit scholarship scheme and the overseas postgraduate research scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It took the Government less than two years to break its word in this regard. The funds sliced from the universities' operating grants have not been returned to them in full through the scholarships scheme. Instead, the Government has deliberately short-changed the higher education sector. The shortfall in Government payments as a result of this deliberate breach of undertaking has been estimated at $1.7m for 1990, $8.2m for 1991 and $8.3m for 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the Government's commitments, institutions have already recruited staff and purchased equipment. Tertiary institutions require commitments to be honoured so that they can undertake long term planning. The Government's dishonesty has denied them this. The Government has quite rightly earned the contempt of the higher education community for this breach of faith. As Professor Brian Wilson, Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA>It is totally illogical for the Government to argue for the increased export of education while reducing operating grants and not maintaining scholarship funding as promised. Higher education is not a commodity where you can turn the tap on and off at a moment's notice.</PARA>
<PARA>In a second press release, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee described itself as `incensed' by the Government's actions. This breach of trust by the Government is, regrettably, typical. It is typical of a Government which flippantly gives undertakings and flippantly breaches them. It is typical of what Professor Ken McKinnon, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong, described with respect to overseas student policy as `disarray within the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA> `Disarray' is a most appropriate word with which to describe the Government's approach to education in general and education export, in particular. The credibility of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, like the economy, is in recession. However, unlike the economy, the Minister's credibility will probably never recover. He is held in such disregard in the education community that even his Labor Party colleagues, such as Senator Aulich, and the premiers of Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia are attacking him savagely. </PARA>
<PARA> This distrust of the Minister is having a serious effect on the national debate on education. This distrust was nowhere more evident than at the Special Premiers Conference last week. It was a matter of national importance that the issue of standards in schooling be cooperatively and thoroughly addressed. Australians have a right to better information than currently exists on the performance of the schools in relation to literacy and numeracy in particular. But such has been the distrust engendered by this Minister that the premiers threw out what the Queensland Premier is reported to have described as `a slapdash late attempt to push something through that had not been the subject of discussion and negotiation'. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wake of this conference the Queensland Premier is reported to have accused the Minister of bungling and incompetence. Few areas have contributed more to the Minister's declining fortunes than his mismanagement of the education export industry and few areas more epitomise his style of management than this area. It is because of this style of management and the mess that it has created that we are today debating the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to this Bill. In the Budget the Government foreshadowed the allocation of $50m for the purposes of reimbursing overseas students who, after having prepaid living expenses and tuition fees, had their visa applications rejected but failed to secure a refund of moneys. The Bill before us today serves two main purposes. Firstly, it serves to provide the mechanism by which the Government can identify overseas students who are owed funds. Then it puts into place procedures by which the Government can seek to secure funds from institutions of the moneys that it has paid out to the students. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will not be opposing today's Bill but when the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill comes before the House I will be moving, as I foreshadowed, a second reading amendment to register the coalition's strong disapproval of the manner in which the Minister has from day one bungled the development of the education export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Before discussing the reasons for our condemnation of the Government's mismanagement of the development of the education export industry, I would like to place on the public record some of our concerns about this Bill. The Opposition has several concerns. The first relates to the capacity of the Government to secure a reimbursement from the institutions. Because the mechanism utilised is an assignment of the contract from the student to itself, the Government will be bound by the same contract that the student entered into with the institution. Many, if not all, of these contracts included refund clauses and the Government will be able to rely on such clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are two amounts which the Government is paying to students which we believe that the Government does not have a legal right to claim a refund for. The first of these is the registration fee, which many contracts specifically state is non-refundable. This amounts to some $150 per student. The second is a $100 gratis payment which to date has been paid out to students but which has no basis in the contract entered into by the students and the institutions. Of course, all such discussion is superfluous where the institution is in receivership or liquidation and there are no funds from which the Government can secure reimbursement. Nonetheless, the Government has been remiss in failing to spell out what rights it will acquire under the assignment of contracts and the Bill and what rights it will not have. </PARA>
<PARA> We are also concerned about the information collection power contained in clause 5 of the Bill. Whilst the Bill specified what information can be obtained pursuant to this clause, albeit in very general terms, there is no reference to what purposes this information can be put. As the Bill is presently drafted, the Government appears to have the power to use the information for purposes quite independent of the purposes for which this Bill is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that some, if not all, of the purposes to which the Government will put this information will be acceptable. Then again, it may be the case that some of these purposes require greater scrutiny. Whatever is the case, the Government ought to have provided this House with additional information as to precisely what purposes it envisages this information being put. This House ought to have been provided with an opportunity to scrutinise these purposes and to determine whether they raise any issue of breach of privacy. The Government was certainly under an obligation to provide such detail if the information it intends to acquire under this Bill goes beyond the purposes for which this Bill was drafted. </PARA>
<PARA> We have other concerns with respect to clause 5. It provides that institutions will have only 14 days within which to fulfil requests for information from the Government. This is potentially unsatisfactory as there is no correlation between the amount of information requested and the amount of time provided to satisfy the request. </PARA>
<PARA> Those honourable members familiar with the operations of the Department of Employment, Education and Training would be aware that this Department has developed somewhat of a reputation for making extravagant requests for information. At the same time it is developing a reputation for not being overly hasty in responding to requests for information for it. Almost eight weeks after the first Senate Estimates committee hearing into the Department, the Department is still responding to questions on notice put to it. Officers of the Department are vested with a power to provide extensions of time beyond 14 days under this Bill. I hope that this discretion is properly used in cases where it is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> My final specific concern relates to clause 9, which imputes the conduct of certain officers, including agents, to the institution. This is generating a degree of concern within the education export industry because some agency relationships were entered into on a highly informal basis. No doubt the Government would have been made aware of this concern if it had bothered to consult with the industry on the provisions of this Bill, but to the best of my knowledge it has made little effort to do so. I put the Government on notice that the Opposition will be closely scrutinising the manner in which the powers provided by this Bill are exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> Having placed my specific concerns about this Bill before the Parliament, I would now like to turn to the broader policy issues and the reasons why the Opposition is moving a second reading debate amendment registering its condemnation of the Government's mismanagement of the education export industry. What we see before us today is an education export industry in a state of chaos. This chaos, by and large, can be traced to the incompetence of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Clearly the Minister is on the ropes. Trust in him has been eroded to the point where even his own State colleagues publicly attack his bungling and incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the consequences of his mismanagement of the education export industry, the words used by the Premier of Queensland, `bungling and incompetent', are not too strong a description. Some 19,400 residents of the People's Republic of China, many of whom came here under unduly lax visa registration procedures, were granted four-year temporary residency in the wake of the events in Tienanmen Square on 20 June 1989. These residents in turn are allowed to claim benefits under the social security system. An additional 25,000 residents from the People's Republic of China-most of whom are English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS)-have arrived since 20 June 1989 and have not returned to their home country. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant number of colleges offering English language intensive courses for overseas students have collapsed and many more are in serious financial trouble. Large numbers of students, predominantly from the People's Republic of China-an estimated 6,000 students-have not been provided with refunds for fees they had prepaid prior to unsuccessful applications for visas. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's reputation in the education export industry is, like the Government's policies, in a shambles. Any industry representative will tell you that many overseas students look with significant antipathy upon Australia as a destination and are now looking elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> How was it that an industry with so much potential went so badly awry? The answer is simple. We have a Minister who acts consistently-a Minister who consistently embroils himself in new so-called policy initiatives without thinking them through. He did it with higher education, he did it at the Special Premiers Conference and he did it with the education export industry. The education export sector, like any other sector of education, required a framework in which to grow. It needed a government which would provide such a framework, would closely monitor factors impacting on the national interest as this new industry developed and which would act cautiously and prudently in the best interests of the industry and the nation. What was called for was close cooperation between the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) so that policies which were complementary and mutually supportive were formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the departments had a working relationship and the Department of Employment, Education and Training was, at least until the Tiananmen Square events, intimately involved in the visa vetting process, these policies were hardly complementary or mutually supportive and, not surprisingly, they failed to work. What we instead obtained was a policy muddle which has necessitated several policy U-turns to provide a remedy. The Minister has not been cautious or prudent and he is unwilling to take advice. Instead of displaying caution, he conducted himself with reckless abandon. Let me quote a media release which the Minister issued in November 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's export education earnings are expected to exceed more than $500 million over the next few years if the country's full-fee overseas student program keeps growing at its present rate. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to claim:</PARA>
<PARA>While I'm not suggesting that we will replace riding on a sheep's back with balancing on a mortar-board, I think that our education sector can play a very important part in our overall trade performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Sadly lacking at this time were words of caution about the potential problems that abuse of visa conditions could pose for the national interest. Also lacking was any informed discussion as to the proper management of the industry, particularly with respect to the protection of pre-paid tuition fees and living expenses. That has damaged Australia's reputation, unfortunately, throughout the Asian region where historically we have had a very good reputation. The Minister's reckless creation of boom-time expectations was matched by an equally reckless Government visa policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The process for the provision of visas was clearly inadequate and one cannot help but come to the conclusion that this inadequacy had a lot to do with the Government's irrepressible desire to bring in large numbers of overseas students so as to fulfil the Minister's prophecies about the industry's potential, no matter what the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the student visa applicants from the People's Republic of China as a case in point. We do not know what the visa rejection rate was prior to the Government acting to tighten up visa procedures, but what we do know indicates that it was small. That should be contrasted with the situation since then. When the Government first tightened its policies in mid to late 1989 the visa rejection rate went to 35 per cent. Later on, it rose to 45 per cent, and since the clearing of the backlog of students which arose during the time that the Department of Employment, Education and Training officials were withdrawn from the Beijing Embassy, in other words, since mid-1990, the visa rejection rate for some 2,000 students who have since applied for visas has risen to a staggering 94 per cent. What a staggering admission that the initial visa procedures were completely inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> As woeful as the visa processing procedures were, the procedures for ensuring visa compliance once the students arrived in Australia were even more dismal. The Government has often tried to portray the large number of students violating their visas as being a product of dishonesty on the part of colleges. For example, in a speech in Melbourne on 30 July, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The private sector of the industry, however, has been tarnished by allegations that some institutions have poor standards and facilities, poor management, and that they have abetted students who fail to comply with visa requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>The reality is somewhat more complex than this statement suggests. The industry did have its rotten apples and I would wholeheartedly agree with the Minister that these rotten apples have grievously damaged the industry. Ultimately, visa compliance is the responsibility of the Government and the failure to enforce visa conditions must be sheeted home to the Government. Indeed, the Government communicated a very contradictory message to the education export industry. On the one hand, it placed conditions on the visas, such as limits on the number of hours per week which could be worked, and asked colleges to report students who failed to honour these conditions. On the other hand, when colleges did make these reports, the Government did nothing. The message sent by the Government to the industry was plain to all: those who observed their obligations at a financial cost to themselves saw nothing result from their efforts, whilst those who turned a blind eye did so with impunity and were financially benefited by such conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech the Minister described the situation as being about-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an unfortunate saga brought about, I confess, by inadequate regulation of individuals and institutions who I expected to conduct themselves better. </PARA>
<PARA>Like the inappropriate creation of boomtime expectations, what this situation is really about is the sending of the wrong signals to industry participants and these signals fundamentally compromise the integrity of Australia's immigration policy. Effectively, large numbers of overseas residents were able to jump the queue and enter Australia without having satisfied any of the tests which normally exist to determine whether a prospective immigrant should be allowed to enter the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is well aware of his errors. He is the Minister most responsible and, after initial hesitation, he has in fact admitted them. He has said he has learnt a bitter lesson. The education export industry is a new one and to an extent a degree of trial and error was unavoidable, but what the Opposition finds impossible to understand is why it took the Minister so long to react to problems which revealed themselves very early in the piece. </PARA>
<PARA> Reports began appearing in the media in late 1987 which pinpointed the exact problems which were developing in the education export industry. For example, two articles appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 October 1987. The first, by Robert Thomson, contained the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is clear that a large percentage of the students are not going to spend $A8,000 or more simply to improve their English and are arriving in Australia with an open mind about returning. </PARA>
<PARA>An article in the same edition by David McNight was even more explicit:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia may be facing the prospect of a large number of illegal Chinese immigrants because of the Federal Government's policy of selling education places to overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> A source within the Federal Education Department says that in some language colleges up to one-third of students on short-term visas are simply not turning up to begin their courses. </PARA>
<PARA>He then quoted a source within the Department who said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is reluctant to admit that a problem of `illegals' might exist because it doesn't want to dry up the flow of money . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to mirror much more what has been said to me over the last few months. Every indication has been given to me that officers of the Department made reports about the problems which were developing in the education export industry, but the Government ignored these problems until they were virtually out of control. </PARA>
<PARA> As many honourable members would undoubtedly be aware, I have now filed a freedom of information request against both the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Minister on a number of matters concerning the education export industry. There has been no answer as yet. It has been very slow in coming. I believe that this request will reveal that the Government had early warning of the problems and difficulties in the education export industry, but recklessly ignored them. We certainly had evidence that the then immigration Minister had warned the Minister for Employment, Education and Training about developing problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter which was reproduced in the Age on 13 August 1990, the immigration Minister is reported to have written to the Minister in April 1988 warning him that the problem of overstaying students-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . could become intractable if not tackled quickly, and the Government could find itself facing growing public criticism for maintaining a program that allowed abuses of its immigration policies. </PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper reported that the immigration Minister had suggested to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that the bona fides of student applicants be assessed properly, but despite these problems, the warnings remained unaddressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make the point that the coalition supports an education export industry. We support such an industry for much the same reasons as those highlighted by the Minister in his second reading speech on this Bill. We see it as a valuable new source of export revenue at a time when the Government's economic policy paralysis is gravely damaging Australia's international competitiveness. Like the Minister, we agree with the views of Ross Garnaut that the education export industry has implications beyond that of export revenue. Speaking about his own institution, Professor McKinnon commented:</PARA>
<PARA>As far as the University of Wollongong was concerned, the decision to recruit internationally was deliberately taken on education grounds. We decided, as part of defining the university's mission, that we would want graduates to have a wider international outlook than has been evident so far.</PARA>
<PARA>There are educational benefits which need to be stressed in the development of this industry and not purely the monetary benefits which have been at the forefront of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Never can it be said that such potential benefits can justify a government turning a blind eye to the potential costs but this is what the Government has done and the costs have been onerous. The Government has had to step in and provide refunds for those students who prepaid fees but failed to obtain visas. Given the lack of health of many colleges, the capacity of the Government to secure reimbursement is suspect. The Government has had to step in and grant temporary residency and social security benefits to the 19,000 People's Republic of China nationals who were in Australia prior to 20 June 1990. The Government has had to step in and provide assistance to those overseas students who, having commenced their studies, were displaced by the collapse of colleges. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite some more aggressive action by the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs against visa violations amongst post 20 June arrivals, the Government has yet to fully confront the problems of the large numbers of overstayers in this group. Much of this could been avoided had it not been for the Minister's recklessness. As I have already said, reckless policy formulation and implementation have become hallmarks of this Minister. Neither he nor his colleagues nor anyone else should be the least bit surprised when his new policy initiatives, such as the one that he has suggested for our schools at the Premiers Conference, have been treated with such suspicion. With the Minister's track record such suspicion is more appropriately labelled as justified caution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1990 and the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill which are currently before the House and being dealt with cognately are related not only by virtue of the fact that they deal with aspects of the Australian system of administering overseas student education but also because in a sense they represent the comparison between the old and the new approach to the whole issue. In a very real way one would say that the first of the Bills, the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill 1990, represents an old approach to overseas students which was based on an Australian view that the process of bringing overseas students to this country should be seen as an extension of our aid program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words, the basis of Australia's overseas student program was a vehicle of international cooperation-a costly subsidised scheme which could be seen as a component of our overseas aid structure. Under this approach to the Overseas Students Bill, which lasted until the Jackson Committee's Review of Australia's Overseas Aid Program in 1985, the marketing of Australia's education was not a priority. Australia was a benefactor providing subsidised education and training services to developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 the Government decided that the subsidised scheme was no longer serving its intended purpose. The Government concluded that the main beneficiaries of the scheme had been private students from countries which were not necessarily most in need of aid. As a result of this determination, the subsidised program was brought to an end. From 1990 new overseas students seeking entry to Australia will have done so on a full scale, full cost basis.</PARA>
<PARA> Some students who came to this country under the old scheme are, of course, still completing their education or training. It is for those people that the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill has been drafted. In simple terms the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to fix the charges payable under the Act in 1991. Those charges cover the higher education, technical and further education (TAFE) and secondary education areas. The charges are set at differing percentages of the estimated full cost of a place to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that in 1990 the charge will raise $42.5m, as compared with $44.5m in 1989-90. This reduction in revenue is, of course, to be expected considering that no new students have been enrolled under a program since the end of 1989 and as students complete specific courses they move out of the subsidised program. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the second Bill being considered today is related to the first by virtue of the fact that both Bills represent aspects of the old and new approach to the issue of overseas students. The second Bill, the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990, can be seen as being a necessary by-product of the new direction which Australia has taken in the educational area. Since 1988 Australia has actively promoted itself as an educational destination. With the active encouragement of the Government, educational institutions have gone into the old marketplace to `sell' educational places in this country. The old subsidised program has been replaced by a sensible overseas educational approach which has allowed this country to export its educational excellence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make no bones about it: this country has a very real advantage in the educational area. Our institutions are very highly regarded overseas, despite what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), said about that no longer being the case. Our accreditation standards are also highly sought overseas. We stand to move into the 1990s on the back of an educational stampede which will earn Australia very much needed foreign capital. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in 1990 some $300m per year flows to this country via foreign students. Not only do they pay their tuition fees but also they have to eat, sleep and pay the costs of everyday living. That benefit also flows to Australia. For years economists have been telling us that we must take advantage of our comparative advantages, that we must specialise in high technology or value added areas which cannot be produced overseas more cheaply or with such quality. The education and training of overseas students is one such area that well and truly fits the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1990 we have some 44,000 overseas students paying full fees with around 7,000 in secondary schools, 1,000 in TAFE colleges and 12,000 in universities. Another 23,500 are in short courses at private colleges. For universities new sources of revenue have been found. This will open up greater educational opportunities for Australian students, particularly by way of greater course variety, increased numbers of places and a higher scholastic standard, and allow for greater general investment in improving our already high educational standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, against this positive background problems have arisen which have necessitated the presentation of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill 1990. In essence, the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the refunding of payments made by overseas students unable to undertake or complete their studies in Australia. In some respects it is a regrettable Bill, born out of an attempt by the Government to give the education industry a high degree of autonomy and made necessary by the great friend of members opposite, the great white hope of deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the Bill before the House relates back to the Government's decision in 1986 to simplify student entry provisions and encourage the provision of short English language courses. In making a decision to simplify those entry provisions, the Government placed great faith in the integrity of the education industry, the vast majority of which, it should be said, is beyond reproach. Even the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein, had something to say about the inefficiency of some educational institutions in this country. Unfortunately, however, as I have said, some operators showed very little regard for Australia's overseas reputation or, indeed, the integrity of our immigration standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that most of us in this House have seen the newspaper and television reports regarding small time educational operators who misspent the advance payments of prospective students, cancelled courses without notice and provided courses which had very little by way of educational merit. From early on the Government had to enhance the regulatory environment in response to these undesirable developments-and therein probably lies the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> From July 1988 institutions were required to screen students for suitability to undertake their courses, and prospective students were required to prepay course fees and, in some cases, living expenses-such were the vigorous marketing methods of some educational institutions overseas and the attacks upon the integrity of Australia's immigration standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In August 1989, as a result of continued problems, the Australian Government further tightened visa procedures. This has resulted in a reasonably large number of students who have paid their fees not being able to take up their studies in this country. The Bill before the House ensures that those students will not suffer as a result of the practices of those poor operators. I intended to comment on other aspects of the Bill raised by the honourable member for Goldstein, but at this stage I just commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill, which allows foreign students to be repaid their fees, a number of critical issues need to be brought to the attention of the House. The first is that, whilst the Government has acknowledged that there are problems in the export education industry, it appears to want to lay most of the blame on the private sector-the schools and colleges. I am prepared to accept that many of these schools have been, and still are, dishonest, but I believe the problem is much wider than this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government appears reluctant to admit that a large proportion of the blame should be sheeted home to a further two sectors. The first and most obvious is the students themselves in the English language intensive courses for overseas students (ELICOS). The private schools and colleges were simply not the ones overstaying visas, submitting false medical certificates, breaching their entry conditions and cheating Australian taxpayers. I do not want to indulge in a pointless exercise bashing these so-called students. The body worthy of well justified and far greater criticism is the responsible Minister's own Department, the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), which needs to accept the responsibility for the trouble that this so-called growth industry has caused Australia. If DEET had merely applied its own regulations that were in place in early 1988, there would be no need for this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that, despite the thousands of words written on the failings of the ELICOS program and the procedures that the Hawke Government has said it has put into place to remedy these shortfalls, the Department still bumbles along, happily acting as Australia's de facto immigration department. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act which illustrate the public face of DEET's attitude towards overseas students. The first document is entitled `Full Fee Student Program Procedure-Non Formal Students With Less Than 90% Attendance in Current or Previous Courses', and is signed by Mr Barry Hogan, Manager of the Overseas Student Section in Victoria, on 26 July 1990. The document clearly lays down DEET's policy for approving extensions to visas, stating:</PARA>
<PARA>The section has a high public profile in the eyes of the participating institutions and overseas students. It is essential to the integrity and authority of the section that decisions made in respect of unsatisfactory attendance and termination are seen to be entirely consistent. </PARA>
<PARA>The document then outlines who has authority to recommend extensions of visas to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Basically, Administrative Service Officers (ASO) class 3 have authority to make the recommendation when attendance is at 90 per cent. ASO5 level officers have authority to recommend for extensions in the case where attendance is less than 90 per cent, but the student has a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner. Officers at the ASO6 level have the authority to make decisions in all other cases. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opinion, this appears to be a very effective system. It also presents a picture of a department composed of able administrators. The stark reality, unfortunately, is very different. For instance, can the Minister explain why it is that, despite Mr Hogan's policy, counter staff at the Melbourne office of DEET have taken to handing out slips of paper-literally, complimentary slips-to students who do not have a 90 per cent attendance level, who do not have medical certificates justifying their poor attendance and who have no valid reason for visa extensions? The complimentary slips are presented by the student to his or her school. The slips apparently say such things as, `Although this student does not satisfy the 90% requirement, DEET will be recommending for the extension of his visa'. Perhaps Mr Hogan has only ASO6s staffing his counters, but in most government offices counter staff are junior clerks. In fact, it is my understanding that DEET's counters are manned by ASO3 level officers, including part time staff. The regulations might be there and might be tough, but they are not being used. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I have been advised that even the previous policy of DEET checking the medical certificates of students has also now been phased out. Several schools have commented that the Victorian Ministry of Education, through the State Training Board, is said to be in the process of issuing guidelines requiring that schools now make the decision whether to accept the genuineness of students' medical certificates. The same schools that the Hawke Government has accused of dishonesty will now be required to check that students are not using false medical certificates to cheat the 90 per cent attendance rule. The 90 per cent attendance rule is not a recent development. DEET in Melbourne has, however, obviously had some difficulty coming to terms with the concept. </PARA>
<PARA> In another of the freedom of information (FOI) documents, Ms Jennifer Ledgar, the Assistant Secretary of the Overseas Student Programs Branch, writing on 6 July 1988, clearly spells out the policy. For the benefit of the Melbourne office of the Department, I will quote from the document. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Institutions should be informed that requests for extension of stay will not be recommended if students are unable to produce a certificate indicating satisfactory attendance. A satisfactory attendance record for overseas students is considered to be 90% and above unless there is clear evidence provided of extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . If extenuating circumstances other than illness are claimed as a reason for not producing a satisfactory certificate of attendance, students should be requested to provide evidence of their claim. These will be considered on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA>In July 1988, the policy on attendance was, I would have thought, clearly laid out. It is a pity for the industry and, indeed, everybody that DEET chose to ignore its own rules. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also makes mention that the industry was initially criticised as being too regulated. I can find very little evidence of this criticism. In fact, the evidence I have would suggest the complete opposite. One of the FOI documents dated 13 November 1987 and headed `Entry from China for English Studies' says, in part:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . At a recent meeting with executive members of the ELICOS Association, it was reported that some institutions when providing information-</PARA>
<PARA>relating, I presume, to the non-compliance with visa conditions-</PARA>
<PARA>to State offices had been told it was not necessary because it would not be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it was the schools, the Hawthorn English Language Centre and the International College of English which back in 1987 pushed for a compulsory attendance level; that is, the institutions themselves pushed for better management of this industry. It was the schools which believed that more regulation was essential. The industry was prepared to comply with and recommend regulations. It was the Minister's own Department that could not be bothered with the rules and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the criticism of the regulations that the Minister is referring to is a letter from Mr Robert G. Stott, a director of the firm Selfort Pty Ltd, dated 26 April 1988. Mr Stott argued that there were a number of factors which could cause students to fall behind the 90 per cent attendance requirement. He in fact argued for a relaxation of the policy. The request was curtly dismissed in a letter from Mr Roger D. Peacock, the Assistant Secretary, Overseas Students Policy Branch, on 11 May 1988. Mr Peacock wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, it has become evident that there have been abuses of the program by a small number of unscrupulous institutions and individuals. These abuses include: numbers of students failing to arrive at institutions after obtaining student visas to undertake specific courses; instances of students failing to put in a requisite number of class hours subsequent to their enrolment in courses; students obtaining employment in ways which breach visa conditions; inadequate provision of teaching, equipment, facilities or accommodation by some institutions; and misrepresentation during the marketing of courses by some institutions or their agents. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable J. S. Dawkins has recently written to institutions requesting that they take all reasonable steps to ensure that these abuses do not occur and that the integrity of the overseas student program is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a great pity that the Minister's own Department was not capable of understanding that its action or rather inaction was the root cause of many of the problems with the export education industry. It is not only junior officers in DEET who give the appearance of not being on top of the regulations. I notice, for instance, that in the Age of 30 October this year-only a short time ago-Mr Barry Hogan, whom I referred to earlier, is quoted as saying that more than 200 overseas students had been identified as having unsatisfactory class attendance and were thus liable for deportation. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason I can find for Mr Hogan giving such a low figure was so the public would believe that DEET was capable of cleaning up the mess-the 200 obviously appearing to be a manageable figure for the Department. The figure I have obtained from the industry is that there are in fact about 500 students who have been identified since July 1990 as having unsatisfactory class attendance and are thus in fact liable for deportation. Furthermore, I might add that figure is only for my own State, the State of Victoria. I wonder how many a good investigator would find, given access to DEET's national records. The prospect is, quite frankly, mind boggling. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some indication that DEET is not keeping the Minister informed of the true state of the industry. I note that in the second reading speech the Minister says that in 1986 there were fewer than 1,400 English language students in Australia and about 500 students in other non-formal short courses. For the Minister's information, I suggest he look at this very closely because it obviously reflects very poorly on the advice he has been given by his own staff or by the central office here in Canberra. The DEET publication, his own Department `s publication entitled Private Overseas Students Statistics as at 30.6.89 states-and these figures are straight from the document-that in 1986 there were 4,248 students enrolled in non-formal full fee courses and 255 in full fee higher education courses. Therefore, it is a disgraceful misrepresentation by the Minister. </PARA>

I am, therefore, frankly at a loss to know from where his advisers obtained the substantially lower figures. The second reading speech also makes the statement that ELICOS institutions provide a valuable bridge to tertiary study. As at 30 June 1989, DEET's own figures show that there were 6,501 people from the People's Republic of China (PRC) students in ELICOS institutions and 4,387 in special studies. Special studies, I remind the House, under DEET's system, as it has been allowed to flourish, include such things as martial arts academies and beauty schools-very strange institutions indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, of course not; they have to come here just to do that, do they not? There were 59 studying at technical and further education colleges and 296 in institutes of higher learning. If the ELICOS schools are bridges, they were bridges to the good life in Australia rather than to tertiary study. Skilled investigators appear to be in short supply in DEET. In my previous speech on the Department's bungling, I made mention of the fact that DEET, in conjunction with the Victorian State Training Board and the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (DILGEA), were conducting an investigation of the industry. I also pointed out that they were concentrating on firms in the industry with good reputations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hogan, in the Age article which I have already made mention of, says, as if to prove my point, that eight institutions had been investigated and there had been no evidence of malpractice found. I would like to suggest to DEET and to the others involved in this futile exercise, that until they start looking at the institutions with bad track records they will not find any evidence of malpractice. Unfortunately, so much time will have passed before they finally get around to the crooked schools, the evidence will be well and truly swept under the carpet. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is not only the Federal Government which believes that overseas students offer a quick fix for the country's financial problems. In a move which has all the hallmarks of earlier Cain Government blunders into private enterprise, the State Government of Victoria -God bless its little heart-has now decided to recruit fee paying overseas secondary students. Until now, the privately run, secondary segment of the industry has been offering high quality education to students. This is not, and has never needed to be, a foreign aid program. The students and their parents are more than able to pay the required fees and living expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Importantly for Australia it is one section of the export education industry which has made a profit and has actually helped our balance of payments, unlike many of the things run by DEET. The Kirner Labor Government, acting as only a true socialist government can, has calculated that these profits are too high. The Peter Pan entrepreneurs in the Victorian Government have obviously determined that whilst they cannot provide the same high quality education that private institutions and the education departments of New South Wales and Queensland offer, they can offer cut price rates. </PARA>
<PARA> This would, of course, be considered an illogical move in any State of Australia, other than Victoria, but Victoria, as we know, at the moment is in a pretty peculiar situation. As a result of the decision the industry will be required to cut prices, standards and staffing levels to match the fees being offered by the Victorians. The Kirner Government can of course afford this move as, along with everything else in Victoria, it is being subsidised by the long-suffering taxpayers of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Education Department decided that it will charge students at least $2,000 less per year than every other institution in the market. Even allowing for the stupidities of things going on in Victoria at the moment, I cannot believe the Victorian Labor Government will prove to be any better at managing the export education industry than the Federal Labor Government has shown itself to be. The Victorian Government is apparently all set to become the discount king, the Billy Guyatt, of the education market and destroy yet another industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister's second reading speech makes mention of xenophobic reactions to the short term problems the industry has faced. In the short term the problems with the export education industry have included fraud, forgery, financial mismanagement, widespread breaches of Australia's immigration laws, bankruptcy and countless examples of government ineptitude. I do not believe it is xenophobic to bring these problems to the attention of Australia and sheet home the blame for this mess to where it truly belongs, to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, and his quite incompetent Department, DEET. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department has clearly had the internal regulations all along to protect the integrity of Australia's immigration program but has chosen by its own actions not to use them. That decision, and that decision alone, is responsible for the introduction of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill and the subsequent costs and charges to the Australian taxpayer. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the various documents I have referred to throughout this speech, most of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill and the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill are vital pieces of legislation. They seek to establish firmly Australia's reputation as a provider of good quality and efficient education services to foreign students-a reputation which has been tarnished by a small number of educational institutions that have adopted less than appropriate requirements of business management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills concern me personally as earlier this year representations were made to me by several overseas students who were concerned at the operations of an institution in which they were enrolled. These students had paid $4,780 to the Modern English Language College of Australia, operating in Brisbane, and expected to receive some 20 weeks of intensive English language study. In fact they received less than half an hour of tuition in English. This was despite the fact that the Modern English Language College of Australia had had the students' money for well over 12 months prior to the commencement of the course. The college was able to gain the $4,780 which it had received from each student as well as the interest from this money. This particular institution had been the subject of a number of previous complaints by students and staff in terms of both its financial operations and its educational services. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that responsibility for accreditation of these institutions as educational bodies is currently the responsibility of the State and Territory governments. The Federal Government does not have the role of supervising the educational standards which apply in these institutions. It is precisely because of institutions such as the Modern English Language College of Australia that these Bills are before the House today. The Bills will deal with those few institutions that have discredited the provision of the overseas students programs. I must stress that it is only a minority of institutions that have abused the system. However, it is this minority that is risking the integrity of the overseas students programs. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills will enhance Australia's reputation as a provider of high quality education services to overseas students. The purpose of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to refund advance payments-that is, those paid before June 1990-by foreign students who are now unable to undertake courses in Australia. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to refund outstanding living allowances to overseas students also in Australia. The Bill will allow for the repayment of moneys paid before 30 June 1990 to overseas students who, because of immigration regulation changes, are no longer able to study in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for this legislation comes primarily from the changes to Government policy which took place in the mid-1980s. Changes to the overseas students program were initiated by the Government in 1985 following the Commonwealth's commissioning of the Jackson Committee to Review the Australian Overseas Aid Program. It is this review of Australia's overseas aid program that is responsible for the massive economic benefit Australia has enjoyed as a result of the change in Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Jackson Committee recognised that the export of education services represented a significant new industry for Australia. Prior to the adoption of the Committee's recommendation, most overseas students were subsidised by the Government. These subsidies varied between 30 and 45 per cent for students paying overseas student charges to 100 per cent for sponsored students who were nominated by their home government under Australia's overseas aid program. It was the belief of the Jackson Committee that subsidies for overseas students acted as a form of industry protection, and that effective marketing and deregulation would enable Australian institutions to compete successfully on the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> The change of Government policy has had a major impact on our balance of payments. In terms of foreign earnings raised from this policy shift, the figures are quite extraordinary. The best estimates available indicate that Australian institutions earned about $200m through tuition fees, travel and admission costs in 1988 alone. It will be close to $300m this year. To achieve this level of activity, and also in accordance with the recommendations of the Jackson Committee, the Government left regulation of the industry principally up to the institutions themselves. The Committee recommended that a supervisory and quality assurance role in administration be left to the individual institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the English language intensive courses for overseas students, commonly known as ELICOS, there is a national ELICOS accreditation scheme (NEAS), which is an industry-based regulatory body. It is an independent and voluntary organisation, and the ELICOS institutions are not required necessarily to participate in NEAS, although I might say that the vast majority of them do. It is in this area that the problems started to appear. They arose because the industry was largely left unregulated by the Federal Government because of existing State government powers and a desire to allow the industry to set its own standards of operation. As a new industry the Government wanted to give some time for the industry to fully establish its patterns of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Not wanting to restrict the activities of these educational institutions and also to encourage greater use of Australia's export services, the Government streamlined entry requirements for foreign students. In 1986 we saw the start of a boom in the number of overseas students coming to Australia to study. The majority of these were in post-secondary courses, principally in the area of short term intensive English language courses designed for students in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> This boom was accompanied by a large increase in the number of private institutions established to cater for this dramatically increased demand. The number of ELICOS institutions ballooned from 19 in 1986 to 105 in 1990, with approximately two-thirds of these being privately owned. The increase in the number of ELICOS institutions was driven by an increase in the number of students who were applying to study in Australia, and it was facilitated by a change in Government student entry provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 there were fewer than 1,400 English language students in Australia. At the end of the last financial year there were 23,500 full fee paying students in Australia studying short courses provided by private institutions. The increased number of private institutions providing short term courses resulted in several private institutions marketing their courses in a way which posed a threat to the integrity of Australia's immigration program. It became obvious that students from certain countries posed a greater risk with regard to overstaying their visas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The institutions have too narrowly targeted their audience. This has compounded the overstaying problem and the later financial difficulties that some institutions have suffered. Because of the overstaying problem, the Government was forced to tighten its entry requirements and procedures for overseas students. The Government did not want to see a large number of students breach their visa conditions, but unfortunately many did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The change in Government policy has been beneficial. There are positive signs that the number of overseas students who have overstayed their visas has decreased dramatically. At 31 July this year there were approximately 9,000 students in Australia who had overstayed their visas. This compares with a figure only three months earlier, at 30 April this year, when the number of students who overstayed their visas was approximately 16,000. This is ample justification for abandoning the streamlined entry procedures which were allowed from 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other nations in our region where ELICOS courses would be easily marketable and popular. Students from these nations would have much less desire to overstay their visas and remain in Australia. ELICOS institutions should increase their marketing programs in countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia so as to broaden the number and range of students applying for entry into English courses. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 concern was expressed to the Government by a number of overseas students that some institutions or their agents were misrepresenting their courses. It became apparent that some institutions were accepting larger numbers of students than they could adequately accommodate. Many institutions also failed to report students who were not complying with the entry requirements of their visas. This was despite an undertaking by the Association of Recognised ELICOS Centres that all ELICOS institutions would report these breaches. It became apparent that some institutions were being used by foreign nationals to gain entry into Australia for other than study purposes. These problems were compounded by the closure, due to financial mismanagement, of one private institution which had large numbers of overseas students. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the good intentions of the 1986 streamlining of students' entry requirements, the system had been abused. Some institutions were operating on a fast bucks policy while operators of other institutions simply did not adopt prudent financial management policies. This, of course, had a detrimental effect on the integrity of Australia's overseas students program as well as on the overseas students themselves. The purpose of the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill is to restore full confidence in our education services available for international students. It was as a result of the mismanagement of some institutions that the Government was forced to act. </PARA>
<PARA> In April 1988 the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) expressed his concern about the abuse of the overseas student program. Many institutions were not complying with the requirements of their ELICOS accreditation. From mid-1988 institutions were required to screen students for their suitability to undertake their courses. It was a requirement that both institutions and students were able to meet the requirements of the courses under the overseas students program. Prospective students were required to prepay course fees and, in some cases, living expenses. Institutions were required to show decency and act in accordance with the overseas students programs. It is because some of these did not that these Bills are presently before the House. Certain institutions did not demonstrate financial prudence with the money they had received from prospective students. </PARA>
<PARA> The year 1988 also saw the endorsement by the National Education Council of a national code of conduct in action by the ELICOS Association and the Australian Council of Independent Business Colleges to adopt accreditation criteria for institutions marketing offshore. It was believed that this code of conduct, combined with self-regulation or co-regulation, would be of benefit to the industry. It was believed that greater innovation would take place. By 1989 it was clear that this approach was not working as expected. It was this self-regulation which some institutions had taken advantage of in order to maximise their own financial position. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1989 it was identified that many overseas students had overstayed their visas. Nationals from the People's Republic of China, Thailand, Taiwan and South Korea were identified as high risk overstayers. Because of the extremely large numbers of overstayers from China, institutions were asked to suspend recruitment from China. Many institutions ignored this request and continued to recruit in China as well as other identified high risk countries. Further regulatory measures will be introduced into the House in the near future to ensure that only those institutions which operate in a responsible and financially prudent manner will be allowed to participate in the ELICOS program. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that problems have occurred in this industry, which has been of great benefit to both Australia and our overseas neighbours. The vast majority of providers in the industry are prudent and are servicing very well the needs of the people of this industry. The Government's actions in these Bills is to ensure that all future operations abide by acceptable standards of behaviour and will ensure the continued growth and stability in this industry.</PARA>

On the one hand he tried the Pontius Pilate act of wanting to wash his and the Government's hands of responsibility in relation to this matter, and on the other he outlined in the most comprehensive way, I think-he will find this himself when he reads his speech-the shortcomings in relation to the administration of the ELICOS program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating the Overseas Students Charge Amendment Bill and the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill. The latter Bill deals with a very specific matter relating to the facilitation of refund of moneys paid to colleges by intending overseas students who may not be able to get a refund when they have not been able to enter Australia. It ensures that they are able to get back those prepaid fees. The Bill deals with only one aspect of the failure of the selling of education overseas by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal concern-the one that ought to be in the minds of every one of us-is how it came to be that some 30,000 or more students, clearly intent on overstaying visas and staying permanently in Australia, were able to manipulate a particular program for their own advantage. There is no doubt that members of parliament on this side of the House recognise the important recommendations of Jackson, that there were unique opportunities for Australia, having regard to its experience and expertise, to be able to give students from abroad the opportunity to learn in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that many of those who were not fully competent in English may well have been advantaged by being able to learn English in Australia, in an English-speaking environment, which would facilitate their being able later to pursue academic studies in our institutions and that we could benefit considerably from that. But in endeavouring to put in place that new market, that new opportunity to enable our academics to demonstrate their competence in international competition there was no justification for putting aside the fundamental provisions of our immigration law which ensure that there is proper testing of the bona fides of those who are to enter this country. That is, in fact, what happened. The whole program of immigration to this country is now put at risk because of mistakes of this order that lead the general public to believe that the administration of immigration in this country is out of control, that the Government has not been able to handle it properly and responsibly and that people who are entering here are not subjected to the ordinary and proper checks that ensure that those who come to settle permanently in this country are the best people for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a defender of immigration; I am a defender of the program; but I find it increasingly hard to defend the program when I know that it is being manipulated by those who would not ordinarily be able to obtain entry. That is what has happened in relation to sham marriages; it is what is happening in relation to those who want to manipulate our compassion as a result of our trying to assist those who have needs as refugees; and it has happened in relation to those who have sought to characterise themselves as students to obtain entry to this country when they have no genuine intention of studying here in Australia. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) in his speech demonstrated those shortcomings in the most comprehensive way. </PARA>

I am quite sure that we would find, if we were ever able to get access to the information, that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs warned all of the parties involved as to the way in which this program would be manipulated if it were left in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I interjected on the honourable member for Moreton is that I am sure that those warnings abounded well in advance of any of the dates upon which Ministers publicly acknowledged that there was a concern. Even at the point in time when they were demonstrating that they had some awareness of this situation, it was hard to understand how we could reach a point where they would still put in place procedures which could clearly be circumvented by those seeking to come as ELICOS students to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to direct honourable members' attention particularly to the press release of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) of 11 October last year because in that statement the Minister said that he was making public details of arrangements being implemented in the Australian Embassy in Beijing following the Government's decision to introduce new regulations for overseas students seeking to undertake non-formal short courses in Australia. Regulations announced on 30 October governing the entry of students from all countries were in response to serious concerns about the large number of students from a number of countries who had been breaking Australian law and remaining in Australia after completion of their study-an admirable admission by the Minister. The Minister's media release then said:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in China is of particular concern because of the large numbers of students who have applied over the last year to come to Australia and are awaiting visa issue. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Chinese students in particular had overstayed their study visas. ``With a rapidly increasing interest in Australia and a backlog of 26,000 applications in Beijing waiting to be processed, the Government and the Australian community, could not tolerate this situation.''</PARA>
<PARA>One would think that that demonstrated an awareness on his part that there was a significant problem. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The new regulations are designed to assist those students who have a genuine commitment to return to their homeland after a period of study in Australia. Australia continues to welcome such students.</PARA>
<PARA>The media release then said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins said that Australia still offered the most accessible short course arrangements for Chinese students. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dawkins announced further steps to speed the processing of a large number of visa applications by Chinese nationals wishing to undertake short study courses in Australia. This initiative should allay some of the concerns publicly expressed by applicants awaiting advice in Shanghai. </PARA>
<PARA>What did all that mean? The Minister went on to say that three additional Australian staff had been appointed to commence work the following week and to process all student applications as quickly as possible. The release continued:</PARA>
<PARA>By the beginning of next week, 19,000 students will have been contacted to clarify their status under the new arrangements. The remaining 7,000 are being assessed for visa issue under the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>What did all that gobbledegook mean? We all know that at the time there were press reports of the violence in China. Shanghai students protested and prompted Canberra meetings and Chinese police were ordered to control students. There was pressure in China. What was happening? It took the answer to a question by Senator Vallentine on 21 November to elicit for me exactly what was happening because it was not clear in the Minister's press release. What the Government did was put in place a system of pipeline processing to circumvent the very new regulations that we were being assured by Minister Dawkins were in place to enable the proper bona fides testing to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members may be interested in what Senator Ray said on 21 November. This was the then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs commenting, not the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. This gives some insight as to the obvious conflict between Ministers that was emergent at that time. Senator Ray was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Given that the Government has recently introduced a new policy governing the entry of Chinese students to Australia for the purpose of studying English, and that this new policy was introduced to curb an alleged overstay problem amongst Chinese students, can the Minister explain whether these new restrictions on entry have been formulated on the basis of proved overstay patterns of Chinese, for instance has it been established that Chinese students over 35 years of age have a greater propensity to overstay than do those under 35.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) The new policy governing the entry of applicants wishing to undertake non-formal study courses of less than 12 months duration and ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) has been introduced to curb a real overstay problem. The overstay rate for students from all countries in these programs is 23.3 per cent. (In 1988-89 21,483 persons were issued visas to undertake ELICOS.) By way of contrast, the overstay rate of visitors is 1.8 per cent and over 1.3 million visas were issued in 1988-89 under this program.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say-and it is particularly important that I emphasise this:</PARA>
<PARA>The overstay rate at the end of May 1989 for students from the People's Republic of China (PRC) was 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>According to Senator Ray it was 40 per cent. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>Since 1 January 1986, 15,111 PRC students have arrived in Australia, and up to the end of May 1989 only 1,685 (or 11.2 per cent) had left Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only was there an overstay rate of 40 per cent, but also the great bulk had found some way of still staying on legally. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's new measures were introduced to address the overstay problem as well as the ``pipeline'' of 25,000 applications lodged with the Embassy in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to explain what the pipeline was, under one of these acronyms I suppose. It meant that they were being given a Rolls Royce ride through the system:</PARA>
<PARA>The ``pipeline'' processing measures are less stringent than the global measures (which will apply to PRC students from 1 January 1990). </PARA>
<PARA> Minister Dawkins would have had us believe that the new system was in place, introduced from August. Senator Ray told us that the new system did not commence until 1 January 1990. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in that ``pipeline'' applicants will be assessed against a lower education level criterion (year 10 compared with year 12 for global measures) and will not be subject to more extensive immigration bona fides testing (required under the global measures). Immigration bona fides tests are applied to assess the applicant against the stated purpose or reason for wanting to come to Australia and likely compliance with the entry conditions (ie the applicant will leave Australia at the expiry of the entry permit).</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to explain that the under 35 age stipulation is an educational rather than an immigration criteria. That was particularly interesting because we have seen articles published since then. There was one by Robert Birrell appearing in the Melbourne Age in which he spoke with some of the officials who were carrying out the pipeline examination. What really occurred at that time was that the pipeline was a basis upon which those students whose applications were in-unless there were very obviously reasons for rejecting them on a bona fides basis-were to be allowed entry because of the embarrassment that the Government was suffering as a result of the number of people demonstrating in the streets of Beijing and Shanghai. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have not only the situation where the 20,000 or so Chinese students who were in Australia at the time of the Beijing massacre on 20 June 1989 have been allowed to stay in Australia under special arrangements put in place by this Government, but also a situation whereby large numbers of students arrived in Australia from the People's Republic of China after the Beijing massacre under these pipeline arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a Senate Estimates committee question to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Teague was given these figures: for November 1989, when the Department started processing applications, 1,206 students arrived in Australia; in December of that same year, 8,830 students arrived; running into the beginning of this year, 1990, 3,921 students arrived in January and in February another 1,062 arrived. That was as a result of the pipeline processing. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we are in a position to be able to make some judgments about what has been happening since that time. It was particularly interesting that our colleague the honourable member for Moreton, who now seems to have left the House, told us that there were previously 16,000 overstayers and that there are now only 9,000 overstayers, so that in some way the record has improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Have they all gone back?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that most of them have not. Why has that situation arisen? It has arisen, clearly, because there is a basis upon which those people who were previously overstayers have now been able to validate their ongoing stay in this country. That is why the figure has come down-not because students have gone back and not because they have honoured the terms of their visas. In the majority of cases it has occurred because those who were here as overstayers before June 1990 have now been able to avail themselves of new procedures for temporary entry, the new arrangements put in place at the behest of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But what of those who have come after that date? They are able to validate their stay. The Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs produces some very useful material in its situation report updates, including one for the PRC dated June 1990. In relation to PRC students it says that they they are now able to make applications to stay on in Australia. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional information is now available regarding the number of PRC nationals who had applied for PEPAE. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that term to mean a form of extended eligibility permit. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>More than 6,600 applications have now been entered onto the PEPAE system and of these 36 per cent or 2,457 are from PRC nationals. Over 8,500 applications have been received but we do not know whether the proportion of applications from PRC nationals will be the same for the remaining applications. From the Revenue Collection System we do know, however, that 211 applications in the PRC Citizen (809) category have been received. </PARA>
<PARA>So there are large numbers of students still accessing provisions whereby they can seek to apply in Australia even though they came allegedly as bona fide students under these new arrangements put in place by the Government to solve the overstay problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We also know that large numbers of PRC students are now seeking to access the Determination of Refugee Status (DORS) Committee procedure for determining whether or not people have refugee status. The number of PRC applicants for the DORS process in December was 73; in January, 121; in February, 181; in March, 262; in April, 124; and in May, 173. This is an ongoing problem of very significant dimension. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address the Overseas Students (Refunds) Bill. I agree with the general aim to refund money to overseas students. One would expect that where an agreement had been reached between a student and a college and subsequently broken, fees would be refunded. We have to face that a third party, the Labor Government, changed the ground rules. This gives us a valuable lesson: do not trust governments; they can change their rules without warning. It is hard to believe that up to 94 per cent of students quite suddenly were not entitled to visas. This Bill is really about two Ministers getting their complementary policies wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another lesson to be learnt is that when governments change the rules, others get hurt. In this instance, the students were hurt, no doubt bewildered by the treatment they received, but not nearly as much as were the institutions that are affected by this Bill. These institutions will know exactly how much the Government considers them. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be noted that this Bill is about tidying up a mess attributable wholly to the Government. But who is paying? The Government is not; it will be reimbursed. This Bill is clearly anti-business, as there is no indication of the Government's role in this fiasco. It imposes new and retrospective conditions on one party to the original agreement-that is, colleges and their staff. It is difficult to conceive a more one-sided document. Most if not all of the obligations, costs and penalties apply to the colleges and their staff. It is important to remember that colleges were forced to break the agreement. What if there were a false claim submitted under this Bill by a student in China? Are we really to believe that a college would challenge such a claim that would involve air fares to China and accommodation? This involves large amounts of money for a severely weakened enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two parties to each of these original agreements. One is being reimbursed, as it should be. I ask why the other is being penalised. The Bill is anti-business when it should not be. Business is all about confidence. In the future, business will have severe doubts about the Government's commitment. The Government encouraged colleges and institutions to enter into this industry and then said, `Ah, we have got it wrong. We have got people abusing the system. Businesses are not abusing the system; the students are-not all, but many of them. Nevertheless, you businesses can pay for the mess'. </PARA>
<PARA> Many students were abusing our immigration system, which resulted in the changes in this Bill. Some businesses may have been acting improperly-I repeat, may have been acting improperly-but the changes, I must stress, were necessary because of the actions of many students. Based on current visa rejections, some 94 per cent of students intended to abuse the system. </PARA>
<PARA> These actions forced the changes, yet reading this Bill leads one to believe that the institutions were wholly to blame. At a time when we are trying to encourage business, it is being attacked in this fashion. This industry is-or, more correctly, was-a strong export industry. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to encourage businesses to commit themselves in the future to educating overseas students when a business could be wiped out overnight not because it was wrong, but because the Government might have been wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only were businesses wiped out; so also were the risk takers who committed themselves to their businesses. All colleges and institutions would have made commitments, in many cases long term commitments. Staff, that is, teachers, would have been on contracts. In other cases, we demand of employers that they be responsible for such things as unfair dismissal-there is no mention of that in the Bill; termination and redundancy payments-there is not a sign of them in the Bill; and long service leave-there is not an indication of that, either. If a business reduces its size, these factors are important. This leads to the employees or former employees of these institutions losing their benefits, particularly those employees affected by the closure of an institution. There is no mention of these people in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably, the most affected are the owners of the institutions. In many cases, these people have lost everything. In Dunkley one institution has gone bankrupt. The proprietors have lost everything-business, house and family. They are in a hopeless situation. But it is an even worse situation where the proprietors have been declared bankrupt. This has also happened in Dunkley. These people cannot start again. They are undischarged bankrupts. What an absolute tragedy! They are forever condemned. Why? Because this Government's advice was wrong. Now the Government's solution is also wrong. They have been completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> A comparison with, say, the plans for wharf employees is stark, indeed. Wharf employees will receive $100,000 each, whereas nobody in Australia is entitled to any benefits under this Bill. Business generally can obtain no encouragement from it. There are many omissions in this Bill. What is in the Bill is adequate, but it is what is missing that is of grave concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Cattle Transaction Levy Bill, the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill will introduce a transaction tax to replace the existing slaughter levy in order to obtain the necessary finance for the running of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the research and promotion activities for the cattle industry, and any other finance that is necessary for this great industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I can use a cattle industry term, this legislation has had a long gestation because it goes back to 1987 when the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council first recommended that the slaughter levy be replaced by the transaction tax. The basic difference is that a transaction tax is imposed on cattle every time there is a transfer of ownership whereas a slaughter levy imposes a tax only at the final transfer-at the time of slaughter. </PARA>
<PARA> Cattle producers have expressed concern through their organisation, the Cattle Council of Australia, that as the levy had increased dramatically from the original 20c per head in 1960 to a maximum of $14.24 in 1988-89, it was placing a burden on too narrow a sector of the total cattle industry, and that it was necessary to broaden the levy base. The maximum levy was imposed at a time when the industry was successful, through its own efforts, in overcoming the chemical residue problems which had created such a crisis in the industry for a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The transaction tax does broaden the base, for a reduction will occur from the present levy of $13 a head for adult cattle to $5.83. If approximately the same amount of money is to be raised, then this base broadening of the levy has been achieved. It is a contentious issue in the industry. Its successful application is uncertain. The Sheepmeat Council of Australia rejected the application of the tax for sheep meat. I can understand that there is a difference between the sheep meat industry and the cattle industry with regard to the applicability of this particular type of levy. It does mean that stud breeders, traders and those who handle cattle along the growing and fattening chain are now included. The traders-sometimes called `dealers'-have been vocal in their opposition, as has the Livestock Agents Association speaking on their behalf. To be fair to the livestock agents, they are well aware of the additional paperwork that they will have to undertake as bookkeepers, because that is the point at which the money will be collected-through the agent-every time the transfer or transaction occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) also has doubts about the long term acceptance of the scheme, because I cannot remember any other legislation where there has been such a simple ability to return to the slaughter levy within the first three years; that is, up to 30 June 1994 it will be quite simple and easy to return to the slaughter levy. Another reason for the change to the transaction levy-and, I suppose, that is also a contentious area-is that the legislation is trying to allocate more appropriately the levy costs between producers on the one hand and processors and exporters on the other hand. It is hoped by this new system that each will provide equal support to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The producer will accept the responsibility to finance the brucellosis and tuberculosis scheme. That in itself, of course, is a shared cost scheme, with the Commonwealth providing 20 per cent to the producers' 50 per cent. Hopefully that massive and most successful scheme will end in a few years, so that will be one less cost for cattle producers. The producers will also be financing the national residue scheme. That is something which we and the coalition believe should be a shared cost with government because it is a public health measure, not just a cattle industry measure. </PARA>
<PARA> The new system will be achieved by three separate levy components. There is the flat rate per head levy on all transfers of ownership paid by the vendor. As I said earlier, the operative level is $5.83 per head with a legislative maximum of $12.25. The beef production levy, which is imposed on a per kilo basis, is paid by the owner of the carcass at 2.17c per kilogram with a maximum of 5c a kilogram. The third part of the levy arrangement is a live cattle export charge, imposed on a live weight basis. That is calculated at half the dead weight basis of $1.09 per kilogram. We do have a significant export industry for live cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> For dairy cattle, bobby calves will be levied at $1 per head. That compares with the present $1.44 per head under the slaughter scheme. Where dairy cows are transferred within the dairy industry for milk production, then the levy is not applied because there are separate levies applied to the milk produced by those cows. </PARA>
<PARA> The beef industry is one of the great industries of Australia and has done much of its own volition and at its own expense to overcome some big problems. One thinks here of the very minimal government support provided when the industry had the chemical residue problem. The cattle industry levied itself very heavily to overcome a problem which was not of its making; it really was of the making of more intensive crop production. </PARA>
<PARA> The cattle industry is not in the news these days as much as the wool, wheat, dairy, live sheep and some of the horticultural industries. Because of that I think we do not give it enough credit for what it is achieving, both within Australia and for Australia in the world. For example, as a result of that chemical residue problem, Australia now has, paid for by the cattle producers of this country, the most comprehensive soil map of the chemical residue status of our soils of any country in the world. That by itself is a big achievement. Because of the knowledge we have and because of the action taken by the cattle industry, Australia produces the world's purest beef. That is, it has the lowest level of chemical residue and we should, in my view, be promoting the purity of our beef to a greater extent than we are. </PARA>
<PARA> The dairy industry and the beef industry have also just about completed, through a very good cooperative arrangement with government at the State and Federal level, the huge program of certifying Australia free of brucellosis. Once again, this ranks us with the best in the world. The combination of those two, together with the efficiency of our cattle producers, means that we are producing in world terms very cheap, high quality, pure beef for the domestic market and averaging about $2.4 billion a year in very valuable and significant exports for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps another reason why beef and the beef cattle industry have not been in the news as much as some of the other agricultural industries is that the price of beef has been relatively more stable on a season to season basis which, of course, masks some quite volatile short term price variations on a 12 month basis. Some of that volatility, in my view, is completely unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the beef cattle industry having this reasonable stability in price, it consistently has been one of the least profitable of the agricultural industries. If one looks at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics' surveys-even as recently as the 1990 agricultural outlook conference held in late January and early February this year-one sees that the real rate of return to beef producers in Australia for the 1987-88 year was 1.1 per cent, for 1988-89 it was 5.2 per cent and for 1989-90 it was minus 0.2 per cent. It was the lowest of the six major farm groups that are surveyed by the Bureau. That included wool and wheat producers at that time. That may have changed somewhat since then, but it has meant that where there is an alternative form of agriculture to beef cattle, the alternative has usually been more profitable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an industry in which the price has always been going to improve, but the reality does not seem to come through. For example, the Bureau's quarterly survey of December 1989 forecast a 10 per cent increase in beef prices for 1990. But by the September 1990 Bureau quarterly review, that increase was down to 4 per cent for 1990-91. If one follows the market-even to the extent of the weekly graphs in the rural journals such as Stock and Land-one can note that this year there was a better price earlier in the season and in winter than in the corresponding period last year. But there has been a very heavy slide in October, which means that for most types of beef the price is now lower than 12 months ago. So much for the early forecast of a 10 per cent increase for 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowing for the uncertainties-there are uncertainties for the industry in the future-and the constraints of low profitability, the outlook for beef still generally remains more positive than for most alternative forms of agriculture at the present time. That is a pessimistic statement in the sense that in the past, as I indicated by the surveys, the industry generally has been less profitable than other primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The beef industry is very well positioned with the growth occurring in the Asian market. Japan this year will replace the United States as our most valuable beef export market. We are not talking here about quantity; we are talking about the returns to Australia. From 1 April next year, Japan will be replacing its very protective quota system with a high tariff of 70 per cent, It will then go down to 60 per cent, then down to 50 per cent, and there is some uncertainty over the final dispersal of the stock of beef held by the Livestock Industry Promotion Commission in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> Korea and Taiwan are also increasing their purchase of beef, including Australian beef, but we do have the uncertainty about whether the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations will fail. If it does, there is the threat that this could bring of European subsidised beef coming into Asia. At the present time under the Andriessen agreement such European beef does not enter those markets. In the United States there is a price ceiling effectively put there by the alternative white meats-chicken and pork, et cetera. There has been a downturn in the US economy and a reduction in fast food purchases. Australian beef constitutes a major part of the hamburger market of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> There is work to be done in the beef industry. We need to guarantee better the specifications of our product so that it can be bought by importers and other countries with confidence and security. We do need to find the right market niches, whether it be for grass or grain fed beef or fresh or frozen beef. Australian cattle producers will require a fair share of the final price profit of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> They are genuinely concerned-I share their concern-about the potential problems of vertical integration and of unequal terms in relation to access for Japanese capital and other capital into the Australian section of the market, while our people do not have the same ability to invest in the retailing end of the market in overseas countries. That heightens the concern of the people in this industry about getting their fair share of the final price. </PARA>
<PARA> With profitability in the beef cattle industry, the costs beyond the farm gate are also of great significance. Transport and processing add dramatically to the price at which beef is sold, particularly in export markets. Generally speaking, the transport and processing sectors of the meat industry are not competitive. That reduces both the profit to the beef producer and, unfortunately, the reliability of Australian beef when competing in export markets against beef from other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to a specific case, the State of Victoria. Victoria is the best-or worst-example of stupidity beyond the farm gate costing jobs. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) in Victoria is effectively costing the jobs of its union members because of the continuing industrial trouble that it creates. There was a time when cattle were brought to Victoria to be slaughtered. Now they are taken from Victoria to be slaughtered. That is quite an indictment of the tactics of this union. We have a nasty campaign under way in Victoria at the present time which is adding further to the uncertainty in the market, the price Victorian cattle producers receive and the jobs of union meat workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also adding to the cost of beef producers at the present time. The Budget decision to increase the cost recovery from meat inspection to 100 per cent from 1 January really hits the meat industry far more dramatically than any of the other export commodities which also will be affected by this very badly timed increase. It comes at a time when there is the problem of maintaining costs, with our greater inflation rate, our interest rates, and our lack of a reliable and competitive work force in both the processing and transport sectors which the beef industry has to use. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to ask on behalf of the industry: when that charge is increased to 100 per cent, what will it be 100 per cent of? There are no figures on what it actually costs. There is no ability for the industry to be able to challenge either the correctness or the efficiency of the charge. There is absolutely no responsibility by the Government in relation to what it is putting on our beef producers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another problem with regard to the Government: in addition to the cost of meat inspection, there is the unreliability of meat inspectors, who are also interfering with the orderly process of getting this product through and on to the markets. I have permission from a frustrated abattoir director to quote a letter that he sent to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 22 October. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you today to protest in the strongest possible terms the walk-off from my plant, Establishment No. 233, (for the second time in four weeks) of the Inspection Staff resulting yet again in a complete shutdown of our entire operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am told by your Regional Director's Office that these stoppages are caused by a dispute regarding redundancy payments to former State Inspectors who joined your Department when the State Service was amalgamated with the Federal. Mr. Minister why is this complete abandonment of responsibilities by your Inspectors allowed to happen, and when is the Government and your Department going to do something about these irresponsible attitudes on the part of these Public Service employees? How can this totally unprofessional and complete disregard for our position in the export market be allowed to go unchecked? Surely the spectre of secondary boycott is inherent in this situation, as we are the innocent party in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr. Minister this Company started operations in May of this year when we reopened the abattoir in Brooklyn Melbourne that had been known as the Co-Operative Farmers &amp;Grazier's Direct Meat Supply, this plant had been closed for three years, and had without doubt the worst industrial relations history in this industry. Since our opening we have not yet lost one hour in industrial action of an internal nature, and we have endeavoured at all times to have at least a working rapport with our relevant Union, (the AMIEU). It is quite frustrating to have a complete shutdown of our plant in such a manner with the resultant loss of morale and goodwill amongst our employees, staff and management teams. </PARA>
<PARA> Please be informed that it is our intention to recoup the losses that we have sustained on these two occasions and we will render the Department an account in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> With the advent of 100% recovery in rates by your Department in January 1991, what guarantees are processors, and this Company in particular, going to get from your Department as regards 100% attendance by your staff when required by ourselves? Are we at all times to be subject to the whims of your MIA hierarchy?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is scandalous. There is a real proposition to be put to the Government. It should defer the introduction of 100 per cent cost recovery until such time as it has established a structure for the meat inspection system that is accountable to the industry and is cost efficient, and that would include the right to hire and fire. The meat inspectors have to meet the reality of what they are doing as employees. In the meantime, the Essential Services Act should be used in relation to the need to maintain our exports. For that matter, we could have a combination of both. That needs to be done ahead of the introduction of 100 per cent cost recovery because only then will it be possible to know what the cost is and to have a satisfactory recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to defer this matter for 12 months, or until such time as it is able to put to the industry a new system, a new structure, a new employment arrangement, which will mean that when the user does pay, the user knows what he is paying for, and is paying for it in an efficient way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the the package of Bills before us has some problems. The legislation is really foreign to the general direction that this Government is taking. It increases administration, places more charges on consumers, increases the complexity of regulations, does nothing to reduce the amount of legislation and increases escape routes for non-payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there are some positive aspects in the legislation, particularly in that it may well be an important component in abattoirs remaining viable. Some abattoirs, I understand, claim that the legislation is important to them because it will keep them in the local community. Country slaughtering is needed because it is close to suppliers, it supplies jobs in a local community, and it helps to keep business activity in local towns. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, applying as it does for three years, will give time for this to be clear. There are other pressures on abattoirs and it would be surprising if the additional levies, or transaction tax as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) describes them, solve their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The package of Bills has been developed by the beef cattle industry, through the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council, which was set up in 1984. It is now spreading the costs across a range of people and firms involved in production, instead of just at the point of slaughter and at the livestock export stage. Payment is made every time there is a transfer of ownership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard some claims to that effect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But there are always new issues, particularly when those opposite will not come clean with the details of their own proposals. The main issue is that it is not possible today to reduce marginal rates of tax from a consumption tax and to fully compensate the taxpayers and beneficiaries without a reduction in the Budget surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only has the Government been calling for details and criticising the Opposition for its lack of details-any details at all-on the consumption tax, but at the recent national conference of the National Party a motion moved by Mr Moppett and seconded by Mr Duncan Gay stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this Council . . . expresses disappointment that no details of the proposed Coalition policy have yet been developed, therefore making it impossible to make final judgments as to its acceptability or otherwise . . .</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not put in the end because somebody ran around the National Party and said, `How dare you say the obvious-that it is disappointing that no details of the proposed coalition policy have been developed and it is therefore impossible to make final judgments about its acceptability'. That was from your own Party. It is an absolute endorsement of what we have said. The coalition in this country went to the side door of Parliament House and at a side door press conference said that it would have a consumption tax-without talking about compensation or any of the other details. I know the heat is too much for members opposite and they cannot stop gabbling. Just keep still for a minute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion goes on to say that the goods and service tax should be subject to a list of provisos as long as your arm, including that there be no disadvantage in the overall tax mix to farmers or people living and working in regional and rural Australia. No disadvantage in the overall tax mix means they would get full compensation under the tax system. Why would that be so only for people living in regional and rural Australia and not for all Australians? In other words, the Opposition is making a claim for decent compensation on behalf of all Australians, the point I have been making in the House.</PARA>
<PARA> The motion says that all business inputs should be exempt from the tax. There are, of course, no details about business inputs. It says that export industries will be exempt from fuel tax and that the overall tax burden for all Australians in business and industry should be significantly reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> This is part and parcel of the motion put by those two people at the National Party conference. If at a conference one of the coalition parties says that it is disappointed no details have been developed and that it cannot make judgments about the acceptability or otherwise of a consumption tax, it is entirely valid for the Government to do the same when the Government is aware of the complexities much more than anybody at the country party conference could ever be.</PARA>
<PARA> That is why the Opposition parties of this country are proposing a new tax base for Australians but with the shocking arrogance of not saying even what the rate will be, whether there will be compensation, whether some of these details will be attended to and whether it would not blow our inflation rate to pieces in the absence of wage discounts. For those reasons, everything which was said in this motion by the National Party members was entirely apposite.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to the article in yesterday's Australian which demonstrates that a significant cut in the share of total public spending to gross domestic product (GDP) would lead to a sustained fall in inflation, unemployment and the exchange rate and a sustainable growth in the economy consistent with rising living standards. In the light of this analysis, can the Prime Minister please inform the House what targets were set for the reductions in the size of the total public sector at the Special Premiers Conference last week and what timetable has been set for achievement of those targets?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3401" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the period when the Special Premiers Conference was talked about, the Leader of the Opposition has behaved in a totally irrational way, marked, first of all, amazingly, by his request to be there. He seems not to understand the very simple fact of life that at a heads of government meeting there is a simple requirement for attendance-that is, those attending need to be a head of government. Until such time as he comes within cooee of that he should just concentrate on other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He now indicates further his complete lack of understanding of what the conference was about. It was not the function or the intention of the Special Premiers Conference to set any targets. We were able to go there as a Commonwealth Government on a very firm basis because this Government has achieved a record in the history of government in this country in terms of a reduction of government outlays as a proportion of GDP. There has been a massive turnaround, most obviously reflected in the fact that we have turned around that inherited deficit of $9 billion to a surplus of the same sort of order. We have turned around a massive public sector borrowing requirement to a situation where now there is no demand made by the public sector on the savings of this country, which, measured in terms of the GDP, is a turnaround of $28 billion; that is, $28 billion that the Government is now not making as a demand on the accumulated savings of this country. When the mob opposite were in office for all those years they were never able to get a surplus. They are the people who talk, talk, talk, but they never deliver.</PARA>
<PARA> What was the performance of those opposite? They had that magnificent exercise-what was it called?-the razor gang. What did the razor gang produce? It produced savings of about $300m. We have set a standard in terms of the reduction of outlays as a proportion of GDP, the like of which has never been seen in this country. So it ill behoves this irrelevancy who is the Leader of the Opposition to start talking to us about reducing government outlays. He was the adviser, as I have mentioned to the House before, who was described by Mr Stone as the meretricious player. The meretricious player, along with the honourable member for Bennelong, did not do anything. All that they did was to accumulate larger and larger deficits. That is their talk; we have acted, and we have produced the goods.</PARA>
<PARA> Coming back to the Premiers Conference, there was never any suggestion that the Premiers and the Commonwealth, meeting together, were going to set targets. What we were about was the very sensible process of saying that we have a Constitution which divides powers and responsibilities. What we were about was the very sensible, practical job of trying to say, `Under that Constitution, are there better ways that we can go about the arrangement of taxing powers and the proportions of grants from the Commonwealth to the States in terms of tied grants? Are there better ways that we can go about the business of delivering services to Australians?'.</PARA>
<PARA> As distinct from the negative, irrelevant observations from the Opposition before the conference that it would be a waste of time, the Australian public has seen cooperation between a responsible Commonwealth government and a range of responsible Premiers-including, may I say, a Liberal Premier in New South Wales who leaves those opposite for dead in terms of his realism, relevance and application to reality. That cooperation from the Labor Premiers and from Nick Greiner in New South Wales meant that we went about the practical job of improving the governance of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> We were not helped before the conference by the irrelevant cynicism of the Leader of the Opposition. We have not been helped during the process of that conference by his irrelevancy about a Federal Budget. We are not helped, nor is anyone, by an inane question of the sort that has been served up to me today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It augurs well for the Australian economy. It was a good number which has seen the underlying rate of inflation decline and which has given us the lowest underlying quarterly inflation figure since the June quarter of 1971. Not only that but it is the fifth consecutive decline in inflation on a quarterly basis over the past year and a quarter. It brings inflation for the year to the September quarter of this year to 6 per cent from 7.7 per cent in June, with a quarterly increase of 0.7 per cent down from 1.6 per cent in the previous quarter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This reflects in the broad a number of things. It reflects a declining general level of inflation as the success of the Government's economic policy ekes that reward from the price system. It reflects the unwinding of certain increases we have suffered, such as the effect of the floods on fresh fruit and vegetables and other extraneous factors which have now unwound. It reflects a 5.3 per cent increase in petrol prices. I notice that there was an attempted interjection opposite that this low number was because of the freeze in petrol prices. Nothing could be further from the truth. The petrol price freeze lasted only three weeks. Let me put it another way. Had oil prices not risen as a result of the Middle East crisis we would be looking at an annual inflation rate with a five in front of it. It was the oil price which kept the rate at 6 per cent, rather than at 5.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The oil price freeze might have made a difference of between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent, in which case we still would have had a consumer price index under one per cent. It means, therefore, that the Government's inflation forecast for the year of 6 per cent, which formerly the Prime Minister and I said was becoming unattainable because of the oil price increases flowing from the Middle East, may again be attainable given this low number we have seen in the September quarter. It means that we have come through a period of almost unprecedented increase in activity in spending and demand with a decelerating inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA> I contrast our figure of 6 per cent with 11 per cent in Britain in a similar economy. The fact is that the Government's general anti-inflationary strategies through wages policy and through interest rates and monetary policy have worked and are working as sympathetically as any such adjustment can work.</PARA>

It is under review by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Treasury, and the Treasurer and I are constantly in conversation about it. We will continue to monitor this situation, and if before the end of this year the circumstances are such that it is appropriate to have a further reduction, then that will be done. All I was saying yesterday-it was the appropriate thing to say-was that at this point there was nothing more that could be done on that front.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3404" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you will notice, this question follows on logically from what I was saying. As all honourable members will be aware, the current GATT Round is enormously significant for the global economy in general and, may I say, for Australia in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope honourable members are aware that the Uruguay Round is the most ambitious review of GATT that has yet been undertaken. In total, there are 15 areas of world trade rules being examined, several of them either for the first time or after a long period of exclusion from the agenda: for example, agriculture, services, textiles and steel. This means that all participating countries and all economic areas have very specific interests as well as a general interest in the successful outcome of this Round.</PARA>
<PARA> The Round represents a chance to further liberalise the world trading system in a way that will matter, but we should understand, as I know the honourable member for Stirling who asked the question does, that the stakes in this Round are very high indeed. Failure, if there is failure, to face up to the opportunities and to walk away without an outcome will probably unleash a round of highly destabilising protectionism, and in that situation there would be no winners at all; everyone would be a loser.</PARA>
<PARA> The Round is scheduled to end with the ministerial meeting in Brussels from 3 to 7 December. As is known, not just in this country but around the world, this Government has been at the forefront of the Uruguay Round through our leading role firstly in the establishment and then in the chairmanship of the Cairns Group. Over the past month, the negotiations have come, if I might put it this way, to a grinding halt due to the paralysis of the European Community and its ability to table an offer. Those offers were due to be tabled by 15 October.</PARA>
<PARA> It is known it is the case that the Cairns Group, led by Australia, has made a progressive offer that addresses the needs of both world producers and consumers and the United States has made a counter offer that is in many ways similar to the offer that was put on the table by the Cairns Group, but the Europeans, Mr Speaker, procrastinated. The Minister for Trade Negotiations went to Europe last weekend and on Monday this week the Cairns Group issued an ultimatum to the Europeans to table an offer or in the absence of that to risk the failure of the whole Round.</PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Europeans finally came to the party and tabled an offer, and I believe that the Minister, who is chairman of the Cairns Group, can certainly take some of the credit for helping to galvanise the Europeans into action. This is an important step to the conclusion of a successful Round but it should be clear from what I am about to say now that there is still a very long way to go. As we understand it to this point-and I put it in those terms, Mr Speaker, because we have not yet the opportunity of seeing in full what has been tabled-the Europeans' offer is completely inadequate in three important areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the proposed 30 per cent cut over 10 years is not comparable in any way to the 75 per cent cut proposed by the Cairns Group as the 30 per cent is backdated to 1986, and that of course is a year when European agricultural support was particularly bloated and as a result most of the proposed 30 per cent cut has already taken place. So in that respect, Mr Speaker, obviously the offer is flawed. Secondly, the European Community (EC) is resisting cuts in the most pernicious of trade distortions, and that is in export subsidies; and, third, the offer is also far too restrictive with regard to market access. So, clearly, there is still a very considerable way to go.</PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, Mr Speaker-and I am sure all honourable members will agree with me-it is not enough for the Europeans now, after they have procrastinated, to put an offer on the table. They now have to be prepared seriously to negotiate in regard to that offer. I can say, Mr Speaker, in conclusion, that this Government, as it has taken a lead in the establishment of the Cairns Group and in its chairmanship, will, particularly through the Cairns Group, continue to do everything in its power to progress the Uruguay Round to a successful completion. And that is because in an overall sense this country needs to have a world in which we have a liberalised trade system, particularly in respect of our farmers, who, I repeat, are the most efficient producers in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a tragedy that in regard to those people, their productivity, their efficiency, is being thwarted by the irresponsible actions of the Europeans and the counteractions of the United States having to meet that situation. It is time, it is absolutely time, that the Europeans now go to the next stage. We welcome the fact that they have put an offer on the table-inadequate as it is. The next stage now has to be meaningful negotiations and we will do everything to encourage that.</PARA>

Without being exhaustive about it, let me say that I have spoken at length with the President of the United States, with Chancellor Kohl, with Prime Minister Rocard and with Prime Minister Thatcher. In respect of Prime Minister Thatcher, whilst it is known that we have very considerable differences on a range of issues, I believe Australia should be indebted to the Government of the United Kingdom for the constructive role it has taken regarding agricultural policies. It has tried to push the Europeans into a sensible position. I have had discussions with her; I have had an interchange of correspondence. Last week I had a letter from Margaret Thatcher, and in the light of that I will be having further communications with other heads of government.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3406" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to inform the honourable member that I believe there was a very successful outcome to the discussions. We had before us the recommendations of the Deveson Training Costs Review Committee, which were very wide-ranging in terms of the way in which the whole approach to training in Australia should be reformed. One of the major parts of that was to ensure that there is a greater sense of consistency across the country in relation to the development of appropriate curricula, in the process of accrediting courses, and in the process of the recognition of skills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise here that we are moving to a time when there is likely to be an upsurge in training undertaken on the job as opposed to training off the job, where a lot of training has occurred in the past. We need therefore a process which recognises skills acquired on the job as well as off the job so that workers participating in the upgrading of their skills can use their training in either setting to ensure they obtain recognisable qualifications, that is, recognised across employers and not just specific to one particular enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA> The meeting of Ministers decided to establish a committee on training curricula, which means that for the first time in Australia we will have a national approach to the development of national core curricula for on the job and off the job training. It was also decided to establish a framework for national consistency in relation to the recognition of skills, the accreditation of courses, the recognition of training providers, and the promotion of accreditation transfer arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> To give a simple example of how important this is, we are all aware that if we have a drivers licence issued in one State we can drive in any other State for a time. However, if the licence is to drive a forklift in one State, we cannot drive a forklift in another State utilising that licence. That is one example of a myriad of idiocies that exist in relation to recognition of skills and the accreditation of skills in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In the apprenticeship system we have a huge variety of times that have to be served in relation to the acquisition of particular qualifications, even though nowhere in Australia do we yet have a proper system of assessment based on the achievement of actual level of competence, which is another area where the States have agreed to move and we will have the introduction of competence based training over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA> The States also agreed to ensure that their technical and further education (TAFE) systems move onto a more commercial basis so that they can compete alongside industry in the provision of training and can do so on a cost effective basis. I think the attitude of the Ministers in Sydney last Friday was extraordinarily refreshing and one which, we hope, will be evident across a range of areas where we begin to realise that the problem of federalism is not just a question of duplication of services between the Commonwealth and the States, but rather the need for a greater recognition amongst the States as we try to turn this nation into something which is more appropriate for our times and circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> I just say in conclusion that whilst I was disappointed that we could not make similar progress in relation to the development of a similar approach to curriculum and assessment and other matters in relation to the schools area, all is not lost as the education Ministers will be meeting in early December and I hope we can take forward that issue and, as a result, put it once more before the Prime Minister and the Premiers at one of their subsequent meetings.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3407" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government has not pursued a policy with religious connotations in respect of investment, but it has generally taken the view that the interventionist structures which were established in the last two or three decades generally produced a suboptimal economic performance for Australia. I think that is generally reasonably well accepted. In that sense, in making a decision to engage the rest of the world, which we had not done before we floated the exchange rate and removed exchange controls, the Government made it clear that every other decision basically encourages competition and hence we have seen the systematic but sympathetic dismantling of protective barriers to expose Australia to more competitive forces abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government succeeded in turning investment around from very low levels in the 1970s to the highest levels on record. That, in part, has been accomplished by a rebalancing of the factor shares between profits and wages without which investment could never have begun and by turning the Federal Budget sector of Australia into a recurrent government surplus, obviating the need to raise $30 billion a year with Commonwealth bonds or State securities. That has meant ipso facto that the private sector has had $30 billion more than it could raise within this country from domestic savings. That has produced an investment program that has been so strong that it put pressure on the current account deficit. In fact, our problem has been not that we have had too little investment, but we have had too much. Some of that went into the non-traded goods area of the economy, but the great burden of it went to the traded goods area of the economy, including the services area of the economy, and also into the non-commodity tradeables area of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the Government could have hoped to get much more investment in the places it has been seeking than that which it has got. That is not to say that in the primary export sector in particular, upon which we rely primarily for the great bulk of the earnings, we do not want to see added value and enhanced income opportunities. We do. In that sense the Government has, on a number of occasions, adopted policies which may be termed interventionist, such as the steel plan in 1983-84 in terms of elaborately transformed manufactures and the export facilitation schemes under the motor vehicle plans. All these things have generally helped on the export side.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that in the last 12 months export volumes increased by 7.8 per cent on the previous year. Non-metal manufactured exports increased by 21 per cent on the previous year and rural exports actually decreased 3.2 per cent on the previous year. In terms of the value of exports, total exports rose 9.7 per cent but manufactured exports rose by 23 per cent by value. The problem with Australia is that it is on a relatively small base because our manufacturing sector was allowed to fall apart over the last quarter of a century. Building that back and building a manufacturing sector which is capable of responding to the opportunities of trade is something which Australia can succeed in but will only succeed in slowly. That is, we have to first turn around the merchandise trade account by dealing with demand and supply simultaneously and then pulling the net income deficit down. That is what the basic game is about on the external account. It will not be done quickly.</PARA>
<PARA> People do have different perspectives on this and there have always been some within our Cabinet. But the general view has been that wherever people wish to invest, generally that is where there will be added value and where market opportunities exist. Generally, the pattern of intervention which we have seen in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies in the post-war years has not been, in my view, as successful as a policy without such intervention might have been. The economies which have succeeded, such as Japan and West Germany, have done so by engaging the rest of the world from a very competitive domestic base. This is also true of us. Wherever there is a successful Australian company abroad, there is generally price competition and business competition at home. It can be seen with the breweries, transport companies, and some of the manufacturers. But wherever there are generally indolent industries sitting behind tariff walls, there is never any performance from them abroad. The lessons of Japan and Germany matter greatly here.</PARA>
<PARA> Much is made of Ministry of International Trade and Industry and Japanese government policy intervention in Japan. Some people regard this as winner picking. The Japanese regard it as building on natural advantages which have themselves been reasonably and clearly established. I tend to think that that is the right interpretation. The fact of the matter is that policy has succeeded as the Japan current account attests, and as do Japanese incomes generally.</PARA>
<PARA> This is not a matter for high religion, but I make this point: If Australia goes back to the interventionist policies of the past and if it turns in on itself and believes that it can extract wealth from subsidised industries, it will make a grave mistake. We have now broken free of this yoke, are out there in the world and have to stay out there. The fact of the matter is that we are good enough to actually make the grade. The shocking problem is that people in the 1950s and 1960s never believed that because had they believed it, we just would not have the productive weakness which is there now dragging the current account down on us. It is a great tragedy that a country such as this, particularly in a period of decelerating activity and restraints upon demand, should not be running a very strong merchandise trade surplus. The reason we are not is that we do not have the productive capacity; it is just not there. As the Prime Minister said, we just wasted a generation on it and we cannot make the mistake twice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. I think it goes without saying that the cost of electricity is a fundamental and pervasive component of Australia's level of competitiveness. It relates, of course, to the competitiveness of industry and, indeed, to the cost of living. We in this House would all agree with the central proposition that its input into all of our manufacturing processes, mining processes, farming processes, et cetera, is important. Therefore, the extent to which we are able to engage in very significant reforms to bring about higher levels of efficiency is no doubt the reason why this matter was before the Special Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The further point to make is that Australia has traditionally faced some problems in this regard because of the federal nature of our system. Investment in this area has traditionally been lumpy-that is, we have been required to invest extraordinarily large amounts of public funds at particular points of time. When we look at the benefits derived from public funds in each State, I think it is quite clear that there are economic inefficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue of interconnection is not a new one. All members would be aware that Victoria and New South Wales have been very much interconnected through the Snowy Mountains scheme, for example. I think that members would be aware that not so long ago South Australia was also interconnected with Victoria and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The issue is brought into sharper focus, I think, when one looks at what is happening in the European Community (EC), where by 1992 the whole of the European Community, or a large part of it, will be interconnected. That is envisaged to bring about a 0.5 per cent increase in the gross domestic product of the EC. Whilst by analogy Australia is only a microcosm, if you like, the same sort of gains are there for Australia. That is why I very strongly support the initiative of the Prime Minister through the Special Premiers Conference to look at just such issues as these.</PARA>

<PARA> We are going to see the household dollar `arbitrised' in a very substantial way between banks and superannuation funds in this country. The superannuation industry understands that there is a very large benefit running its way from Government policy and retirement incomes policy. They are alert to this and to the problem. That is why the Government is now seeking tighter safeguards and standards for the industry, particularly in relation to the disposal of assets, which was the cause of this particular problem.</PARA>

They brought themselves into it. I have had no conversation with the Commonwealth Bank, although I know that the Life Insurance Commissioner has. I do not know whether the Commonwealth Bank sees itself as part of this scheme, but if it does not that would be a matter for, basically, the board and management of the bank-not the Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Health and Medical Research Council is one of the most important institutions in Australia. Certainly as far as health is concerned it has become the foundation of excellence and the base of an approach to health research and health care in this country which puts us very much in the forefront in the world in terms particularly of health research but also in our approach to health care. As I said to the Council this morning, the response that we have seen in this country to the HIV infection and to AIDS has in many respects been a classic example of the way that fundamental research has been linked to a philosophy of prevention and to the development of policies that certainly up to this point appear to have been very successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This morning at the opening of the 110th session of the National Health and Medical Research Council I took the opportunity to address the Council on a number of issues. There has been an internal review of the Council. When I became the Minister I took the opportunity to appoint a number of what I described as independent appreciators so that there was an external input to that review of the Council and its activities. As a result of the review process, I concluded that it was timely to propose that the Government establish a legislative base for this very important Council. Properly framed legislation will allow the Council to operate at a distance from government with the authority and the autonomy necessary for it to make difficult decisions across the whole spectrum of health issues in today's environment. At the same time the Council will be accountable directly to Parliament and its planning priorities will become more visible and open to public and professional scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> In medical research alone Australia, with less than one per cent of the world's population, contributes some 2 per cent of the international medical research effort. I believe that the Council's status as a national institution will be enhanced by these changes. As it will be a truly independent national institution, I trust that the States and the territories will maintain and even increase their confidence in the Council to provide leadership in setting national goals and standards on issues of concern to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Council was first established in 1936 it was as a result of a 1926 royal commission on health. That royal commission proposed the creation of a Federal health council to promote cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States on matters of health where the States had legislative powers and the Commonwealth had financial and other resources. There is no doubt that we have had a very strong base of cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in this area. This is particularly so in the area of research where the National Health and Medical Research Council spends about $100m and where I think everyone would agree that the priorities that have been set have been important and we have established a very good tradition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council has a history of addressing contemporary issues and at today's conference the discussion of the health impact of greenhouse and greenhouse itself as a major theme of research indicates the relevance of the Council and the way that the Council is contributing to what is understood now to be a top priority for the Government in terms of its environmental priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council for the last three years has been Professor John Chalmers from Adelaide. He was the first non-bureaucrat as Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Today we have seen Dr Diana Horvath of the area health service in the eastern Sydney area become the first woman Chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council. In these days where equal opportunity is seen as an important priority for this Government, her appointment reflects on her great academic background, her administrative excellence and competence and her vision that the health system in Australia will need to face very difficult resource issues, difficult ethical questions, where there will always be limited funds to meet our health priorities. I cannot imagine anyone in the area of health more qualified to take on this very important job at this point in the Council's history.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a real blowtorch. Can't you see me quivering? I retract nothing from what I had to say about the foray of the Leader of the Opposition into international affairs. Wherever he has gone he has been marked by a lack of understanding and irrelevancy. My position in regard to what I had to say on the position of the Japanese has not changed one iota. It is a very simple position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of people, obviously including the Leader of the Opposition, want to say-if they have not got the guts to say it explicitly then they have an implicit position-that for some reason Japan is to be regarded as a unique, second rate nation state and that, whereas it is the right and, indeed, the obligation of all other nation states to be able to make whatever decision they will as to the proportion of their Budget that they will allocate to defence matters or what decisions they will take in that area, Japan will not have that right or be in that position. What I have said is simply this: it is for the Japanese-not for us or anyone else-to decide what the Japanese shall do. Publicly, and privately in conversations with the Prime Minister, the foreign Minister and other leaders of government there, I have been at pains to say to them that, if they, through their own processes, make a decision in regard to these matters, that will be understood and accepted by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Leader of the Opposition has a different position, let him spell it out. The problem is that those who are attempting to tutor the Leader of the Opposition in this new field for him-he knows nothing about foreign affairs and has had no experience in it-have a mission impossible. The Leader of the Opposition understands nothing in this area. Let him face up to the question I put to him: does he differ from what I have said consistently, and what I repeat in this place-that it is for the Japanese Government to make its decision, not under some inhibition that it shall be fettered as no other nation is? If the Japanese Government wants to make the decision of the sort that he is referring to, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government is concerned, that is a matter for it.</PARA>
<PARA> Let the Leader of the Opposition face up to this issue if he has the capacity to understand it: If he agrees that it is appropriate for the international community to consider whether now, at the end of the twentieth century, as distinct from 1945, the changes that have taken place in the world are such as to make it relevant to consider whether Japan should be considered for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, how would he begin to reconcile permanent membership of the Security Council with a position that Japan would in some way be precluded from being able to play its part in the enforcement of decisions by the Security Council? That position is intellectually untenable, it is internally contradictory and it is one which, if embraced by the Leader of the Opposition, shows absolutely no understanding about the realities of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> We simply cannot have a position where we contemplate, as the Leader of the Opposition does, and as I have done, in looking at the world at the end of the twentieth century, whether it is reasonable to ask the question: If Great Britain and France are permanent members of the Security Council-a decision regarded as appropriate in 1945-is it now appropriate to think, given the changes that have taken place in the world, about whether permanent membership of the Security Council should be available to Japan? If that is the case, if that is a reasonable question to ask-and the Leader of the Opposition seems to think that it is; and if he does, at least he has got to first base-let him address intellectually the question: Can one be a permanent member--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ask the honourable member, with all of his great intellectual force, to go along to the Leader of the Opposition with all his powers and knowledge of international affairs, and help him wrestle with this question: Can a country be a permanent member of the Security Council while, for some unstated reason, it is in a position where, unlike every other permanent member of the Security Council and every other member of the United Nations, it will be precluded from participating in the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations? Honourable members opposite should wrestle with that and explain to the Leader of the Opposition what the intellectual basis of that position is. Of course, the answer is that, once they have had their little wrestle with it, once they have applied their little minds to it, they will come to the conclusion that it is not possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I come back to what I have said from the beginning-and I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition challenges it at all in this silly question that he asked. Does he challenge the proposition that I have put, that is, that it is a matter for the Japanese Government to make the decision that it wishes to make? If it comes to the conclusion that it does not want to participate, then that is for Japan. That is what I have said. What I have said, what I adhere to now, and what I imagine the Leader of the Opposition should adhere to, is that we cannot have a position where we say, at the end of the twentieth century, that we are going to apply something uniquely to Japan and to no other member of the United Nations-that it shall be precluded from being able to do these things.</PARA>
<PARA> If the Leader of the Opposition believes that that is the case, he should spell out why it is so. Once he has applied his mind to it, with whoever is attempting to advise him in this matter, he will come up with the obvious answer. I suggest that he have a yarn to the honourable member for Kooyong because he would leave the Leader of the Opposition for dead in this area. The honourable member will explain to him, if no-one else can, that his position is absurd.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. What progress has been made in the implementation of the national Aboriginal education policy and what are the implications of this policy for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3413" SPEAKER="Tickner The Hon R.E." NAMEID="RJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HUGHES" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the launch of that policy on 26 October last year by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, extraordinary achievements have been made in implementing that policy. All States and Territories have adopted strategic plans for the implementation of the policy and each of those plans has been adopted, not only in consultation with the Commonwealth Government but also-and most importantly-in consultation with Aboriginal educative consultative groups in the States and Territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those strategic plans focus on four main goals. If I had to epitomise and summarise the very essence of the Aboriginal education policy, I would say that it is about ensuring a fair go in education for Australia's indigenous inhabitants. Those goals are, firstly, to ensure Aboriginal involvement in decision making; secondly, to provide equality of access to Aboriginal people in education services; thirdly, to raise the rates of participation; and, finally, to achieve equitable and appropriate educational outcomes for Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA> I give the honourable member for Oxley two very graphic examples of the achievements of this policy so far-one in the government school sector and one in the non-government school sector. In relation to the government school sector, I am pleased to remind the honourable member that on 19 September this year the New South Wales Minister for Education, Mrs Chadwick, announced that Aboriginal studies would be a subject for study in the higher school certificate in the State of New South Wales from 1992. That subject would cover a wide range of matters including land rights, religion, land and water use, culture and social systems.</PARA>
<PARA> She also said-and it is important to tell the honourable member this-that if a greater understanding of our culture and the origins of our country and one another can come from this course then it can have nothing but a positive effect for all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not only government schools which are taking the lead in this important area of educating Aboriginal Australians and focusing on the other part of the member's question on educating non-Aboriginal Australians about Aboriginal history and culture. The non-government school system in broad has also taken important initiatives. On 24 August this year a major public release of the Catholic Education Centre Office policy for Sydney was made. Importantly, that Catholic Education Centre Office perspective concedes that Australian history has usually been presented from a non-Aboriginal point of view. That strategy says that it is vital for Catholic schools to acknowledge the true history of this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I give one graphic example of that. Those of us who come from the State of New South Wales would have learnt from textbooks and from our teachers as we grew up that in 1813 Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth first crossed the Blue Mountains.</PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members-Well?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RJ4">Mr TICKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That says a lot. It was as if Aboriginal Australians never existed. We never learnt the Aboriginal perspective of Australian history. One of the goals of the national Aboriginal education policy is to address that very question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say two things. Firstly, we need to do more. There has been initiated by the Australian Education Council a review of the teaching of Aboriginal issues in Australian high schools. Secondly, I wish to highlight what a very important model the education policy provides in addressing Aboriginal disadvantage. It is based on strategic planning. It is based on long term goals and it is based on bipartisan cooperation between the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories. I thank the honourable member for his question.</PARA>

<PARA> There are a number of technical reasons for this. One is that I understand that to provide members with copies of their speeches which they may wish to play in their electorate offices while they are not there might cost in excess of $100 each. It crossed my mind at the times I was asked this by a number of people that I could maybe get films made of a number of members' questions and answers and speeches and send those films to them to remind them of those questions, answers or speeches, but I thought that that might have been a little bit too cruel for all involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -In rising today on this matter of public importance, the topic of which is the Government's failure in administration and accountability of Aboriginal affairs, I put my arguments in three main areas: the first is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), which limped into the arena last Saturday, the centrepiece of the Government's Aboriginal affairs policy for the last three years; the second is the lack of clear accountability in the area of Aboriginal affairs; and the third is the administration of Aboriginal affairs where there has been total failure to show realistic, achievable and measurable goals for Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, let me deal with the elections on Saturday for ATSIC. Let us not lose track of what ATSIC actually is: it is the centrepiece of the Government's Aboriginal affairs policy since 1987, and after all the heaving, groaning and turmoil one would have expected a result better than what we have today which, even on the most optimistic estimates of the figures, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) can only say is no worse than voluntary local government elections. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told in this chamber by the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that proposals to establish ATSIC were of great and historic importance for all Australians. The present Minister assured us in this chamber that ATSIC would provide maximum participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of Government policies that affect them.</PARA>
<PARA> What we have seen is millions of dollars spent in the lead up and on an election in which two-thirds of those eligible did not cast a vote. Try as hard as he might, and as much as he may wish, the Minister simply cannot put any sort of gloss on this because whatever way one compares the figures they show that for two-thirds of Aboriginal Australians ATSIC is a complete yawn. We can get some idea of this by comparing it with the previous National Aboriginal Congress (NAC) election figures or by comparing it with the recent voluntary plebiscite that occurred over part of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> First to the National Aboriginal Congress: the last election in the NAC was in 1981 when 43.3 per cent of eligible people turned out to vote and that was deemed so low at the time that it was a major reason for the demise of that organisation. Nine years later with an Aboriginal electoral information service operating for three years, a $5m appropriation to run the elections and six months of hype on ATSIC, all we can get is a 33.3 per cent turnout that the Government claims is a success. There is just no way the Government can talk up this figure; in Tasmania it was as low as 10 per cent of eligible voters. </PARA>
<PARA> To claim, as the Minister did yesterday, that this is roughly equivalent to the turnout in local government elections is quite remarkable. First, he overstates the results in the comparison with Tasmania because the figure that he gives of 20 per cent is correct only if one includes in that figure all those people who did not vote because they live in a local government area that was not having an election. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the figure is, it really does not matter, because to compare the centrepiece of Aboriginal affairs policy to a backblock local government election is clearly ludicrous. The reason for low turnout at local government elections is that people deem them to be irrelevant. If people do not perceive something to have a direct bearing on their lives they do not vote, and that is what is happening with ATSIC. In comparing ATSIC figures to local government figures, the Minister is really saying that this centrepiece is being said by Aboriginal people to be irrelevant to them. </PARA>
<PARA> A more interesting result emerges when one looks at what happened in south-east Arnhem Land and Groote and Bickerton islands. These places held a plebiscite three months ago, a voluntary poll amongst people who have difficulties with mobility and literacy. In a voluntary poll such as this we could expect a real and genuine comparison. The fact is that in the plebiscite in south-east Arnhem Land 42 per cent more people turned out than on Saturday, and on the islands 39 per cent more people turned out than on Saturday. The Minister's arguments simply do not hold up when he claims that the figure is low because people have literacy problems or that it is a success when compared to recent local government polls. Clearly, the centrepiece of what is supposed to be self-determination for Aboriginal people has had an extraordinarily shaky start. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not stand here today to be a prophet of doom for ATSIC. On this side of the House we have tried very hard to give it a fair go. In many cases we have pulled our punches because we believe that an organisation, even one to which we were originally opposed, deserves a chance to get established and to get its accountability in order. I have not taken cheap shots at ATSIC because Aboriginal affairs is too important for cheap shots, but it would be remiss of me not to say that if this Commission is to be taken seriously by the Opposition it must be a vehicle for the legitimate needs and aspirations of Aboriginal people, not merely lofty rhetoric, or it will be lost when it comes to practical solutions for people who are crying for help. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I raise is that of accountability. At the moment there is a challenge to the election held over from the Full Bench of the Federal Court for no other reason than that the relevant documents were not tabled in the Senate. Quite simply, we do not know whether the elections are valid. We know they are minimal, but we do not know whether they are valid. This is not a minor clerical error, as the Minister would have us believe. These entire elections are unnecessarily at risk because of a failure to pay attention to detail. This illustrates the lack of accountability existing in ATSIC. The Minister is not prepared to take responsibility for a potentially catastrophic event. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even worse when one thinks about what the Minister is responsible for. The Minister does not have a department; he has only a commission that may or may not be given authority to speak to him. The Minister has only legislation. In the Parliament this year there has been no legislation on Aboriginal affairs. The major piece of legislation to be administered is the ATSIC legislation, and here the Minister has failed to pay attention to detail. The Minister is a lawyer. The detail should not escape him. Does he really think that all that is required to fulfil ministerial responsibility under the Westminster system of government is to ask officials who are not responsible to him that something be done? It is inconceivable that the Minister could have allowed this to occur in a matter so fundamental and simple as tabling of documents. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Minister without a department and responsible only for legislation. When things get tough it is not good enough for him to throw up his hands and say, `It is not my responsibility'. He cannot flick pass this one to a third-class clerk. In effect, not taking responsibility even for the legislation in this most delicate and tragic of areas shows that really he is the Minister for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The last Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who ran a major election, Senator Peter Baume, said in the Senate in 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>I have supervised a National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) election-at least, I have been accountable and responsible for it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the administration of Aboriginal affairs, the Government has simply not gone beyond lofty rhetoric and has been very short on practical solutions for people who are crying out for help. This is exemplified by the national Aboriginal health strategy. In June this year the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) put out a joint press release stating:</PARA>
<PARA>A meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers today agreed to implement a broad based program to address the serious health problems afflicting Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>I put out a press release at the time complimenting them for agreeing to implement the program. Their joint press release further stated that this strategy was the first time the Commonwealth and State governments had joined forces to develop and target services for Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders. That was June. In recent weeks other information has come across my desk. A letter to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) from the Australian Medical Association (AMA) states that three months having passed since the establishment of the health strategy, the Association was concerned that nothing appeared to have been done. In a press release last week the AMA states:</PARA>
<PARA>The NAHS, which outlines a wide-ranging plan for providing Australian aboriginal communities with effective access to proper health care seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMA has therefore written . . . to the Prime Minister . . . to highlight the inaction on this vital initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation states:</PARA>
<PARA>You are aware of the perilous state of Aboriginal health. The facts are too stark to deny. Why then does the Government seek to hide behind past efforts?</PARA>
<PARA>So we have gone from the stage in June where it was going to be implemented to a stage now where it has vanished without trace. The lofty rhetoric and the sentiments raised people's hopes and expectations but they are not matched by any practical reality. This is the same sort of lofty rhetoric that brought us national land rights legislation, a treaty and a cynical and pathetic promise to end child poverty. Anyone who knows anything about Aboriginal Australia, as the Minister does, knows that is simply untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully understand and appreciate that in tight economic times it may be quite unrealistic to expect new money for new initiatives. What Aboriginal affairs is about is ordering priorities. We are not on about spending $40m on the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that has shown nothing new in the last two years and now is providing a milch cow for civil liberties lawyers. That money is desperately needed and it is needed to have some clear priorities and clear goals. </PARA>
<PARA> Figures on Aboriginal business funding schemes were passed on to me yesterday. The Minister might like to confirm whether these are correct. They are correct to the best of my knowledge. At the end of September, out of 548 current loans, 380 were in arrears. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three hundred and eighty loans were in arrears. That is not bad. Coming from Victoria, I know that is something that the State Bank or the Victorian Economic Development Corporation (VEDC) could be proud of. But it really is not good enough for a Federal government department to exhibit that degree of incompetence with its loan administration portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When looking at the performance on issues in Aboriginal affairs one thing that stands out is the breakaway land council. We have had figures that 33 per cent is a successful turnout around Australia, yet a group of people in south-east Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt had a 60 per cent turnout to vote that they take control of their own affairs. In the four weeks that it took the Minister to make a decision, a white adviser with strong links to a Labor Party senator was able to run around, collect signatures and organise the thing to be torpedoed, simply because those people's own wishes were seen to be playing too much to the tune of one political party. Now, over three months since the plebiscite, we have still not heard any result. If self-determination means anything at all, surely it means that the people who are voting to take control of their own affairs can at least be given some hope that a decision will be made and that they will not be left in the dark for three months as they have been at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a problem with even a small technical area like Federal Government reports. Members of this House who have sat on the Federal Parliament's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs will know the work, the effort, the expense and time put into putting out reports. This is one of the most onerous committees there is because a great deal of time is spent travelling around Australia. The Federal Government has not responded to a single report that has been put out since November 1986 and the Minister has had several months to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I finally turn to the issue of a more bipartisan approach to Aboriginal affairs. On 22 June, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) wrote to the Prime Minister in response to the Prime Minister's letter. In his reply he said this:</PARA>
<PARA>We recognise the importance of reconciliation and, to this end, would like to know how you intend to proceed with regard to the process of reconciliation, as there might be considerable room for common ground. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not walk away from that letter or from the possibility of exploring common ground and working together to find some real solutions to the problems that are facing Aboriginal people in Australia, but in the 4 1/2 months since that letter was sent, we have not had the courtesy of a reply. If the Minister would care to give us a reply or would care to pass the message on to the Prime Minister, we really would like to have the opportunity to officially know what he is thinking and to try to work together to find some common ground. I do not walk away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> In reply to that letter, the Leader of the Opposition also said to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm sure you would understand we would not want a more bipartisan approach to limit us from criticising the Government, so long as we perceive these issues to have been inadequately addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point of the matter of public importance today. We are not prepared to stand by and see lofty sentiments without any practical application for Aboriginal people. Those issues that we want to see addressed are those issues that marginalise Aboriginal people, that stop them from having the dignity to be full participants in Australian life. They are problems relating to areas such as health and housing. They are issues that we believe need to be defined in terms of goals and some political and intellectual honesty. We are not prepared to sit back and see failed elections, a lack of accountability, a disappearing health strategy and expectations raised only to be dashed once again. In the end, our attitude towards Aboriginal affairs is based on the belief that Australians, whatever their origin or cultural belief, share one country and one future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate not so much in any spirit of anger, but with some sorrow that the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), feels it necessary to raise a matter of this nature at this time. I also say that my remarks will not in any way damage the commitment I have to work with the Opposition in relation to developing cross-party cooperation and a more bipartisan policy in relation to Aboriginal affairs. It would be extraordinarily easy for me as the Minister, knowing the events of the past eight months, knowing what has been put forward by the Government and by myself as Minister and the response that that has met from the Opposition, to launch now into some aggressive attack on the shadow Minister. I choose not to do so, but I do take this opportunity to set the record straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept that the shadow Minister's comments were delivered in a moderate way. Indeed, he has raised a couple of important issues I would seek to touch on in the course of my remarks. One of those is the national Aboriginal health strategy. I acknowledge that bipartisanship does not mean that the Opposition should not criticise the Government. But it does mean that any opposition, whether it is a Labor or non-Labor opposition, has to act honestly and with wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last hour or so I have had cause to reflect on a speech made by the chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), Lois O'Donoghue. She spoke in a very important address to the Royal Australian Institute of Public Administration delivered on 13 June this year about government administration of Aboriginal affairs in Australia. She made the point that it is one of the most difficult areas of administration. As the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) would know from his own experience, it is concerned with a wide spectrum of issues. At the heart of those issues are the rights of Australia's indigenous population, as Lois O'Donoghue said, with an ancient culture and with roots deep in time. Government administration is concerned with the delivery of services to remote communities. She said, and I agree, that it relies on cooperation by all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> But, most importantly, Lois O'Donoghue said that it must be sustained through the support of the Australian people, at the basis of which is public attitudes. Both the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs and I as Minister, and every honourable member of this House, have a role to play in shaping public attitudes in relation to Aboriginal affairs. That is why we have to be acting at all times honestly and with wisdom. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the chairperson of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission who has raised this issue; the Sydney Morning Herald, to its great credit, in a recent editorial talked about the need for the Parliament, including both Government and Opposition, to put an end to what it described as the worst kind of political point scoring that often passes for public debate in other areas of government. I hope that I, as the Minister, and the shadow Minister can rise to that challenge because, if we fail and if either side of politics fails, we fail this Parliament and we fail this nation in relation to its obligations in Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of things that I would like to say in response to matters specifically raised by the shadow Minister in relation to the questions of my performance. I was somewhat disappointed by some of the comments by honourable members on his side of the political fence who sought, I think, to diminish the importance of this debate by a number of comments that were made. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, I want to turn to the issue of public accountability. The shadow Minister is quite correct in highlighting the fact that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission is not like a government department. It is quite different. It is a statutory authority. My relationship with the Commission is different from the relationship a Minister has with a government department. It is different both legally and politically. </PARA>
<PARA> However, having said that, I want to make it absolutely clear that ATSIC, identified as a statutory authority, has a greater degree of public accountability than any statutory authority formed under any law of the Commonwealth or of the States. ATSIC is accountable through annual reporting to Parliament, through the procedures of the Senate Estimates Committee and through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I can tell the shadow Minister that I want to elevate that Committee in status and treat with great respect the reports that that Committee makes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is subject to review by the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Accounts and by the Auditor-General, but it is also subject to review by a new body formally established by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act-that is, the Office of Evaluation and Audit. This body conducts regular evaluation and audits of the Commission's programs and operations. The office has a legal responsibility to alert both the Commission and myself, as Minister, to problems relating to the operation of the Commission. The Director of that office is a ministerial appointee. It is a very important position. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the shadow Minister something that I think he does not know. Let me give him an example of the kind of approach that I seek to bring to bear as Minister. History will record that there was a public advertisement for the position of director of the office. I was not satisfied with the initiatives that were taken in relation to ensuring that there was an arm's length selection panel. My view was acted on and the position was then readvertised and the appointment was eventually made by a selection panel totally at arm's length from me and from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That is very important because this Office of Evaluation and Audit does play such an important role. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister touched on the issue of the failure to table the rules for the ATSIC elections in the Senate. I have not had the opportunity to comment on this in this House. Let me do it now. As Minister, I was appalled. I think that what happened was an affront to the Senate. It was an inexcusable lapse in public administration, and I have made that view known to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> But I should also make known to this House that the circumstances and background to the failure to table have been, to a very large extent, already placed on the public record. I believe that no Minister could have acted more prudently or more cautiously, not just in signing the relevant papers and being informed that certain things were to be done, but also in checking formally in writing to make sure that they had been done and then in obtaining a formal written assurance that that had been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, because of a terrible accident and failure of those charged with the responsibility of ensuring tabling, it did not happen. I am very distressed by that and I have made known to many honourable senators with whom I have had contact my deep regret that that happened. But that failure ought not to be something that causes the Commission to suffer long term administrative agony and it ought not to be a failure that is visited on any Aboriginal person either in ATSIC or in the wider community, as was done in the Senate yesterday. So I want to take this opportunity to put those views formally on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm, raised a number of very important matters. I want first of all to go to the issue of the national Aboriginal health strategy because he is quite correct in highlighting the importance of this strategy. I welcome his support and, I think from his comments, his endorsement of that national Aboriginal health strategy. I have gone on the public record on previous occasions to make critical pleas in relation to a call to arms to people around Australia to address this issue of Aboriginal health and to respond to the call for a greater degree of empathy with the very just claims of Aboriginal Australians in this area. The fact is, as has been said before, that to be born an Aboriginal child in Australia in 1990 means that, because of that accident of birth, that child is statistically doomed from the moment of birth to a shorter period of life and a lower standard of health than other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and I have a very strong commitment to that proposal. I am sure that we will get support from State and Territory governments, as we already have to a degree. Formal proposals will be put to our Government in the coming period. I will have more to say in the Parliament and publicly about this strategy as the months go by.</PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister did not talk about very important areas of remarkable achievement for this Government and for this portfolio. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy was a matter that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) raised in Question Time and about which I have spoken many times publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal employment development policy is another policy of great achievement by the Government, with much more to be done. But it is about self-reliance; it is about Aboriginal people having the opportunity to get a future for their kids and for them to have the same opportunities of employment that non-Aboriginal Australians have. It is an area of great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister spoke also of the proposal for a new land council in south-east Arnhem Land. I will tell him straight that I have a strict legal responsibility. My responsibility under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is to be satisfied of two things: firstly, that a substantial majority of Aboriginal people in the area support the formation of a new land council and, secondly, that the area is appropriate for a new land council. I say on the public record, and it is something that I am prepared to repeat on numerous occasions, that on every occasion when I have received advice on this matter following that plebiscite I have responded to the advice that I have received. I had no hidden agenda. The fact is that I have had literally more contact during the time of that plebiscite with some of the supporters of the new land council than I had with people from the Northern Land Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I say on the public record that no-one from the Northern Land Council ever approached me to tell me that they did not support the formation of a new land council. They may have had a variance of view about some question of boundaries; but never did anyone challenge that decision. So I will continue to act in accordance with my strict legal requirements. As anyone who has followed that issue will know, it is an incredibly complex issue, mainly because the people on Groote Eylandt and Bickerton Island have come out publicly and in personal representations to me telling me effectively that they have changed their minds. As Minister, that puts me in a difficult position; it is not a position that I welcome. But my obligations are to observe the terms of the land rights Act and that is what I will do. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one of the most important matters, if not the most important matter, that the shadow Minister raised. He is quite correct in referring to the letter written by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the Opposition's response to that letter. The letter from the Leader of the Opposition in essence said, as I see it, the following things: that the Opposition was open to supporting a process of reconciliation but that it wanted to get more specific information from the Government about what the Government had in mind and that the Opposition was committed to addressing areas of Aboriginal disadvantage. On that issue I am shoulder to shoulder with it. It also said in the end paragraph that the Opposition was `yet to be persuaded' of the desirability of some document or instrument of reconciliation as the outcome of that process. I say to the Opposition that I welcome that response. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to the matters that the shadow Minister has raised, as I have said publicly before, I and the Government undertake to consult with the Opposition on this matter and to try to continue to deal with the Opposition in good faith on these issues. The agenda-it ought to be the Parliament's agenda-is about changing the face of relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in the coming decade and, most importantly, as a nation to move in a concerted and coordinated way to address the massive disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal Australians as a national goal leading to the centenary of Federation. Neither the shadow Minister nor I must allow anything to get in the way of addressing and achieving that noble objective. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating here this afternoon the rather inadequate and in some ways farcical situation regarding the deficiencies in the area of Aboriginal affairs and in particular the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation which is now in existence and which in many ways in the minds and eyes of many people has entrenched separatism in this country rather than trying to integrate the Aboriginal people into the mainstream of Australian society. In a sense we have set up a quasi-black parliament-if you like, a socialist taj mahal-which was the brainchild of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand), the previous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and in some ways it has almost as much credibility as the initial Aboriginal treaty that he put up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we have just had elections to elect close to 800 Aboriginal representatives to advise the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), through regional councils, on the way in which the money should be spent. I remind honourable members that there are only 224 members of these two chambers of Parliament; it is an interesting comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> The original ATSIC legislation was full of flaws and errors. I think there were 300 amendments associated with it. It was the second most amended piece of legislation since Federation. At one stage it became an acute embarrassment even to the previous Minister's own colleagues. It was deferred for months, and I think many of them hoped that it would never come on. There was a lot of criticism of it, and there still is, from many prominent Aboriginal community members such as Charles Perkins and Neville Bonner. The former head of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) resigned at one stage. I believe there was no real support for it. It was not wanted. It certainly was not understood. It was an imposition of a Western system on the Aboriginal people. We challenged the Government at the time to have a referendum on it, but it refused to do that, knowing full well that it would have been defeated and that there was certainly no credible mandate for it. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members doubt all that, it was reflected just recently in the very low voter turnout. The Minister can talk all he likes about the reasons why this may have taken place but if the Aboriginal people had wanted it and believed in it they would have turned out and voted for it in greater numbers than the 33 per cent who did. I remind the Minister that more than 33 per cent turned out to vote in the recent Federal election, so why did not more turn out in this election?</PARA>
<PARA> The figures I have here may not be totally up to date but the best result was in the Northern Territory, where about 47 per cent turned out. Then we drop down to Queensland, where 39 per cent of those eligible turned out to vote. In Western Australia the figure was 38 per cent. In my own State it was close to 22 per cent. In Victoria it was 17 per cent. For Tasmania the figure I have been given is that only 8 per cent of the eligible voters turned out to vote. </PARA>
<PARA> An interesting first assessment of that is that the more urban the Aboriginal electorate the lower the turnout. In Tasmania something like 320 people out of 3,600 turned out to vote for 17 vacancies. Even if only one person were being elected at 50 per cent of the votes plus one he would have needed only 161 votes and the job would have been his. We were electing 17 people, so the mind boggles at the very low number of votes a person would need to get a guernsey.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the election that has taken place is in any shape or form representative. It is certainly not more representative than the system that we have now and I do not believe it can be credibly talked up by the Minister in any way. It is quite wrong to compare it with local government voting, as the Minister did, and leave out ridings where people did not have to vote because there were not any more candidates than vacancies. We can compare it with the Aboriginal vote in the previous Australian election and with voluntary voting overseas. The overseas figures are: Canada in the last election, 75 1/2 per cent; United States of America, 53 per cent; Sweden, 86 per cent; New Zealand-that was only a week or two ago-87 per cent; France, 64 per cent for the assembly, 80 per cent for the presidency; Germany 83 per cent; the United Kingdom, 75 per cent; and so on. We have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The polling booth figures are even more alarming. I was given a set of figures from the Northern Territory. In the two lowest booths nobody turned out to vote-nobody at all. Even John Halfpenny, manning the booth on a slow day, could have handled that workload. There are a few booths with one, two, three and four voters. Something is drastically wrong. I deliberately selected the Northern Territory because that had the highest turnout. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, despite quite extensive efforts by the Government to get people to turn out, only about 33 per cent voted. People clearly did not want to vote. Why did they not turn out to vote? Many Aborigines do not see themselves as being separate from mainstream Australia. That should not be glossed over. Many Aborigines resent what has gone on with the ATSIC legislation. Admittedly there is wide apathy. The ATSIC legislation was imposed on many against their will. But a substantial proportion do not care. Many believe things will not change anyhow because the Minister has the final say and a number were quite ignorant of what was even going on. </PARA>
<PARA> But there were many other factors. There was the time factor. Many felt they were disfranchised because they were not on the Commonwealth roll, for one reason or another, and if they were not on the roll they could not vote. I acknowledge in that regard that fortunately many worthwhile candidates stood, and we all applaud that, but it is sad that many worthwhile candidates did not stand, for a whole host of reasons, and that has to be rectified if we go ahead with this again. </PARA>
<PARA> A large number who stood came from the Aboriginal bureaucracy. The former bureaucracy of the ADC and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is still largely intact when all is said and done and will still be there when the final results come out and the polls are declared. But what will happen with these 800-odd candidates? Will we have travel expenses and accommodation expenses-all on top of $5m to run the election. </PARA>

We have already seen serious illegalities revealed in the purchasing of expensive computer equipment. One group of orders ran $100,000 over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us hope we do not go through this farcical waste of money, non-supervision and non-accountability that we have been through over the last couple of decades in this country. I believe there is a case to be put that $5m just on running the election alone could have been better spent in health, education and housing, not to mention jobs and addressing problems like domestic violence. We have set up a fourth tier of government. We have Federal government, State government and local government for everybody and now we have this fourth tier for 2 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> The method of voting even leaves something to be desired. As the Minister has said-and he regrets that it happened-the rules for the ATSIC elections were not even tabled in the Senate as required. When people turned up to vote, it was a declaration type voting. People were crossed off the roll, they made their vote and they put it in into an envelope; then it went into another envelope which was signed. Many Aborigines resented that because they felt each vote could be tracked through. The provision that the votes have to be in the envelopes for seven days was put there, I believe-the Minister may correct me-in case somebody protested that they were not actually Aborigines who voted. This sort of nonsense is inevitable if citizens are going to be characterised on racial grounds as to whether or not they can vote. That is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA> The votes will take weeks to count. Imagine if 100 per cent, and not 33 per cent, had voted. It would be even more farcical than the Australian Capital Territory elections under the d'Hondt system. There are many inequities too. The Party that trumpets one-man one-vote comes up with a seven times disparity in each State between voting weight, depending on where people live. That is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, we have imposed Western democracy on Aborigines, and it is a non-representative and meaningless system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps it would be useful to commence my remarks by reading from the Hansard of 19 September 1974. Senator Bonner, as he then was, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I say that the day is fast approaching when this compensation for dispossession of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders must-I say `must'-be channelled to an all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander statutory body empowered to administer such a compensation for dispossession fund, for the survival of fellow Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. The statutory body must be empowered to call upon such non-Aboriginal expertise as is considered necessary by the body.</PARA>
<PARA>Former Senator Bonner, then speaking in 1974, represents the better side of the debate about Aboriginal affairs, the side of the debate which has the twin faces of this Parliament looking constructively at what can be done to seek to rectify what is, I think, conceded across all parties to be an appalling blot on our history. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that one area of public administration in our country where we have to say that we face enormous difficulties to redress problems of the past is Aboriginal affairs. Those problems of the past arise not because of simple problems which require administrative remedy but because of a pattern of dispersal and destruction of Aboriginal culture which occurred following the European settlement of this country and which is only recently becoming understood. Books such as Reynolds's The Other Side of the Frontier have opened the eyes of many in our community to the difficulties and the destruction that occurred in traditional Aboriginal societies following the white invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still seeing the backwash of those days. Those of us who receive in our offices the reports of the various inquiries into Aboriginal deaths in custody will be traumatised consistently by the descriptions that occur time after time of the kind of desperate lives that are being led by people who are the indigenous inhabitants of this country. It presents enormous problems for any Government that is seriously trying to address the policy failures of our past. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not calling upon the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), to hold his hand in criticism of what the Government will do. There will be plenty to criticise. In such an area there will always be room for constructive criticism. I call on the shadow Minister to hold his hand from those gratuitous opportunities for cheap shots. I fear that on this occasion self-discipline has been unfortunately lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> On too many occasions, it appears, people do not want to miss an opportunity to take a quick and easy hit at somebody in the position of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is seeking to bring together a new process in a new environment. I say this about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) process: it is a process which is designed to encourage self-determination. It is a process which for once says, `We will step back and pass over to elected Aboriginal people the responsibility for making decisions about the administration of their own portfolio area'. Of course, that will impose new responsibilities on the Minister and on this House. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no longer going to be good enough to say, as perhaps previous Ministers said, `I have supervised'. Ministers no longer will be able to say they have determined certain issues with respect to Aboriginal affairs. Once we concede the right of people to take self-determined action, once we permit people to be elected and to then respond in a democratic way to achieve their own self-determined ends, then the Minister must have a different role to play. The Minister must be able to say to this Parliament-and this Parliament must also take its part in responding to this issue-`I disagree with what the Commission has done, but because it is a democratically elected body and established by the laws of this nation, it has a right to proceed in a way which I would not encourage and which I have indeed urged against'. No doubt such occasions will occur, but that is no different from what would occur, for example, in this Government's relationships with State governments, local governments and organisations which are composed of elected officials at any level. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing the beginning of a new way in which we will relate to Aboriginal Australians-a way which former Senator Bonner foreshadowed in 1974 when the historic resolution passed by the Senate recognised the past dispossession of Aboriginal people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the core of this debate. What I believe is fundamentally misplaced about the debate is that it fails to grapple constructively with what ought to be done. I do not disparage the work of the shadow Minister. In my role as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs I know that he works constructively on a wide range of issues, not only with that Committee, but also with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> In the recent report of the Committee entitled Our Future Our Selves we looked forward to how Aboriginal policy can best be shaped to reflect the needs of those in our community. In recommendation 16, for example, we looked to make sure that we have more efficient delivery of services. Recommendation 16 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth renegotiate agreements with the States and Territories over their respective roles and responsibilities for the delivery of services to Aboriginal people, in line with the general thrust of the report of the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17 states:</PARA>
<PARA>As the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission develops its structures and administrative capacities, Commonwealth, State, Territory and local governments view the . . . Commission as the co-ordinating agency for working with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a constructive, helpful and perfectly reasonable approach. I believe that what we should be doing is encouraging the greater strength of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, recognising that it has now been established as an elected body and will speak for Aboriginal people in a way which no such body which existed previously has spoken for them. It is simply not correct to say that the establishment of ATSIC in some way has been undermined by the failure of Aboriginal people to support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister yesterday made some telling comparisons with participation in local government. I turn to my own State of Tasmania, which has been used as an example. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) suggested that many Aboriginal people did not participate in those elections in Tasmania because, for example, they did not want to see themselves as separate. In Tasmania, the situation is a little more clear-cut. Amongst the diversity of Aboriginal opinion, only one significant strand of opinion sought to put forward nominations for that particular region in Tasmania. Whilst there was a slight oversubscription in positions, there was no vigorous contest for the positions because the alternative view which was expressed by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, and vociferously articulated by Michael Mansell, was that the ATSIC legislation was to be rejected because it was part of a white structure. In fact, quite the opposite to the proposition that the honourable member for Parkes put forward is true. The group that sought to encourage a boycott of the elections did so not because it feared that it was in any way separate, but because it was not separate at all; it did not reflect Aboriginal sovereignty as it had sought it to be expressed. The reality is that Australia wide, one-third of Aboriginal Australians have participated in this election, a number greater than that which participate in most local government elections. When one realises that in the United States, for example, some significant elections concerning the composition of the national government are decided by something like 50 per cent of those who are eligible to vote, one sees that it is quite a good starting point for the establishment of that body. Now that that body has been established, there is no putting the genie back into the bottle. </PARA>

<PARA> To assist the process of investigating accidents and incidents, officers of BASI are given the power to summon witnesses and to require those witnesses to answer questions. These powers, and other matters relating to air safety investigation, are provided for in the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, due to a technical amendment of the Air Navigation Act at the time of the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority, those parts of the Air Navigation Regulations relating to air accident investigation may, if the matter was to be considered by a court, be found to be invalid. An amendment is proposed to the regulation-making power of the Air Navigation Regulations to remove the doubt about the validity of those regulations. The amendment is to be backdated to 1 July 1988, the date from which it appears that the regulations could be invalid. There have been no prosecutions for breaches of the relevant provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations between 1 July 1988 and the present time. By virtue of subclause 4 (2) of the Bill, any conduct engaged in during that time will not be an offence under the relevant parts of the Air Navigation Regulations. </PARA>

This arrangement provides significant economies, and is convenient for aircraft operators as only one account is received for the two organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The economies of the current charging arrangements can only be maintained if common provisions apply to both sets of charges. The Civil Aviation Act allows for some changes in the method of calculating the penalties applying to operators who do not pay their accounts by the due date whereas the Air Navigation (Charges) Act does not. The proposed amendment of the Air Navigation (Charges) Act will align it more closely with the Civil Aviation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Broadcasting Act 1942</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill amends the Broadcasting Act to enable the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health to delegate the power under the Act to approve the text of medicine advertisements to the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A Public Service Board Review of Drug Evaluation Procedures which reported in 1987 recommended, among other things, that self-regulation of advertising of therapeutic goods occur for a two-year trial period. The Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia has agreed to participate in approving the text of advertisements for medicines and has set in place administrative arrangements for assessing the advertisements. It is intended that the Department of Community Services and Health will monitor the arrangements to ensure that they are meeting the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will also include a definition of the term `medicine' in the Act to clarify what types of products require approval for their advertisements. The new definition will make it easier to determine whether advertisements for products such as ointments, lotions, eye drops, throat lozenges, suppositories and nasal sprays require approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act. Clause 12 amends the definition of `aircraft' for the purpose of the provisions dealing with charges and statutory liens. Currently, the definition requires that the kinds of machines, craft or objects which come within the scope of the definition be prescribed by regulation. As there is no need to limit the kinds of aircraft which would otherwise come within the scope of the definition, clause 12 removes the reference to prescribing the kinds to be covered by the definition. </PARA>
<PARA> Until recently, no action had been taken to prescribe kinds of machines, craft or objects for purposes of the definition. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that, as a result, the Civil Aviation Authority did not have power to impose statutory liens. Therefore, the Bill provides that clause 12 be deemed to commence on the commencement of the Civil Aviation Act. This does not impose any new liability retrospectively; rather, it is intended to ensure that liabilities that have already been incurred are not evaded because of a technical defect in the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 provides that regulations made under the Civil Aviation Act may require that, in circumstances specified in the regulations, a statement concerning the contents of air cargo be given by the consignor. This clause fixes a maximum penalty of $3,000 for the carriage of cargo when a statement is required but none has been made. It also fixes a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for knowingly or recklessly making a false or misleading statement. </PARA>
<PARA> These requirements are to replace a provision included in the Civil Aviation Amendment Act 1990, which is to commence on 24 November 1990. That provision would require that all items of air cargo be accompanied by a declaration of contents. Following representations from the aviation industry to the Civil Aviation Authority, the Authority requested the amendment to accommodate circumstances in which it may not be practical or desirable for cargo to be accompanied by a declaration of contents. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 18 provides for regulations to be made under the Civil Aviation Act to enable persons who are alleged to have contravened a specified provision of the Civil Aviation Regulations to pay an on-the-spot fine as an alternative to prosecution. The maximum penalty would be set at one-fifth of the maximum penalty on prosecution of the offence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intended that, on payment of an on-the-spot fine, there would be no determination of liability and no conviction would be recorded. All moneys paid to the Civil Aviation Authority under this system would be paid by the Authority into consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a system would enable the Civil Aviation Authority to utilise its resources more effectively in ensuring that its safety standards for aviation are met. At present, the only way of penalising a breach of the regulations is to prosecute. As this is often expensive and time consuming, there is a disincentive to prosecute minor breaches. Also, in the case of minor breaches, the prosecution process may be unduly onerous on the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA> The aviation industry will not be disadvantaged by this proposal as any person alleged to have contravened the regulations would retain the right to proceed to prosecution through the courts, rather than pay an on-the-spot fine. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments Relating to Environmental Protection</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 11 September this year, the Government tabled its response to the report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise (HORSCAN). As part of its response, the Government indicated that it intended to amend the legislation for the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation to require them to take account of the environmental effects of aircraft operations. This will enable them to take ameliorative measures as necessary, and to ensure the cost is borne by the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Civil Aviation Act and to the Federal Airports Corporation Act included in this Bill will extend the functions of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation to include carrying out activities to protect the environment from the effects of aircraft operations. These amendments form part of the Government's undertaking to HORSCAN, and are in line with the Government's commitment to the community to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are being consulted on the issue of recovering the costs of carrying out environmental protection activities. At this stage, it is intended that cost recovery legislation, based on the principle of polluter pays, be introduced in the 1991 Autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation Act is to be amended to discourage the abuse of alcohol and other drugs by seafarers on board ship. The proposed amendment provides that if a seafarer is under the influence of alcohol or another drug to the extent of affecting the performance of his or her duty, a prison sentence of up to one year may be imposed. If the impairment in the seafarer's capacity results in death of, or injury to, another person or loss of, or damage to, the ship or its cargo, a prison sentence of up to two years may be imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation Act is also to be amended as a result of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendment will remove doubt about the validity of regulations under which the Marine Council exercises its functions, to ensure that unsuitable persons do not serve in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Telecommunications Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Telecommunications Act empower the Minister to give written directions to Austel regarding the variation and cancellation, in addition to the issuing, of customer equipment permits and cabling licences. They also create an offence where a person fails to comply with a written notice from Austel to disconnect customer equipment for which there is no permit. Where such an offence occurs and results in damage to the network and/or loss to a carrier, that carrier will be able to apply to the Federal Court for relief. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments also make it mandatory for a person selling customer equipment for which there is no permit in force to notify the customer of the fact in the form prescribed by the regulations. This means in effect that it will be obvious to consumers whether the telephones and other telecommunications equipment they are buying have an Austel permit for connection to the public network or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amended Act, Austel will be able to wholly or partly waive application fees payable under the Telecommunications (Application Fees) Act. It is intended that Austel will use this power mainly to waive fees for the connection of specially designed equipment for disabled persons, and in the case of registered charities and benevolent institutions. The amendments also exempt Austel from Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes. This is in line with the practice for other similar Commonwealth statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the above amendments, the Bill will also make minor amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, and the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 to facilitate the administration of those Acts. The schedule to the Bill will correct some very minor drafting errors that have occurred in some other Acts. The amendments proposed by the Bill will have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I have great pleasure in introducing to the House the Australian Centennial Roads Development Amendment Bill 1990. The Bill amends the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act 1988, broadening the scope of the Federal Government's land transport assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988, my colleague the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) introduced to the House the Australian Centennial Roads Development Bill. At that time he indicated that improvement in Australia's land transport sector was an integral part of the process of structural adjustment adopted by the Government to improve the efficiency and export competitiveness of our major industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Centennial Roads Development legislation represented a major development in the Federal Government's role as a provider of road funds. It concentrated the Federal role more firmly on roads of national economic significance. There is now a need to improve upon that program by expanding the commitment to national roads and by broadening the Government's program of assistance to reflect its integrated approach to land transport reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aiming for a land transport sector in which both road and rail undertake the tasks to which each is best suited. This requires a rail system which is more efficient and competitive-a system equipped and able to meet the needs of users. It requires reform of road charges and vehicle regulation to remove distortions in States' revenues and road costs and to improve the productivity of the road system and road transport operators. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues were reflected in the historic agreements reached by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Premiers and Chief Ministers at the recent Special Premiers Conference in Brisbane. A heads of agreement was signed, marking the commitment of all governments to the establishment of a National Rail Freight Corporation. This historic agreement means that a single commercial corporation will be established to undertake interstate rail freight services. The Corporation will encompass existing railways' interstate freight operations and will involve Commonwealth and State equity. It will commence on 1 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Heads of government also agreed to the establishment of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme together with uniform technical and operating regulations and nationally consistent charges. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms will address the key problems in land transport. They will also require an unprecedented level of cooperation between Federal, State and Territory governments. The positive approach to reform evident at the Special Premiers Conference indicates that there is a willingness to maintain the necessary cooperation and impetus for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> These reforms have the capacity to provide significant economic gains. The Industries Assistance Commission in its last annual report conservatively estimated that transport reform would yield a 3 per cent increase in Australia's gross domestic product. This is roughly equivalent to the annual growth from all sectors of the economy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> As an indication of its commitment to reform, the Government has broadened the scope of its land transport funding to increase the focus of assistance on projects of national significance and to target funds through special programs to projects with high economic and social returns. To reflect this more integrated approach, the Australian Centennial Roads Development Act will be renamed the Australian Land Transport Development Act. The Bill gives effect to commitments made by the Federal Government prior to and during the last election to introduce three new land transport funding programs. They are the provincial cities and rural highways program, the road safety black spots program and a program for the funding of urban public transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> In his land transport statement of 27 February 1990, the Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to establish the provincial cities and rural highways program. As indicated by the Prime Minister, this program will concentrate on roads of major economic significance which lie outside capital cities. It will complement the present national arterial roads category which funds major projects with high benefit-cost ratios and which are of vital importance to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In targeting funds to accelerate the upgrading of rural highways and roads in provincial cities, the Government recognises the importance of rural roads to the economy and the need for country Australians to have access to a good quality road network. </PARA>
<PARA> In announcing the provincial cities and rural highways program, the Prime Minister identified the Pacific Highway as a candidate for funding. Other rural roads which are likely to receive funding under this program are the Bunbury Highway in Western Australia, the Todd Highway in South Australia, the Victoria Highway in the Northern Territory, the Capricorn Highway in Queensland, the Calder Highway in Victoria and the Tasman Highway in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> Existing measures which ensure the efficiency of spending on national arterial roads projects will also be applied to the provincial cities and rural highways program. Projects will be subject to tendering requirements and to be eligible for funding will require an advantageous benefit-cost ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide the Government with the ability to target funds where the need is greatest, funding will not necessarily be tied to fixed State shares. The Minister for Land Transport will determine eligible projects according to national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed by the Prime Minister, provincial cities and rural highways funds may also be used for priority improvements to mainline rail systems. Ten million dollars of provincial cities and rural highways funds in 1990 will be made available to the States for works preparatory to the establishment of the National Rail Freight Corporation. A further $40 million will also be drawn from other categories of assistance for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's new road safety black spots program was announced by the Prime Minister in December last year. The program will provide $120 million over the next three years for cost efficient safety projects to reduce the number of road deaths and serious injuries on Australia's roads. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and ten million dollars will be provided to eliminate a range of black spots by improving the condition or management of locations noted for a high incidence of crashes involving death or serious injury. A proportion of the funds determined by the Minister can be made available for other road safety measures such as electronic speed and alcohol limit control equipment, bicycle helmet rebates and pedestrian safety measures. </PARA>
<PARA> A further $10 million has been earmarked to increase support for road safety research and public education activities. The Government aims over the next three years to target further areas such as attitudes towards the use of alcohol and drugs when driving, occupant protection, vehicle design, fatigue and the provision of national databases. </PARA>
<PARA> To encourage States and Territories to adopt a range of uniform safety countermeasures, black spot funding will be provided only to those States and Territories that have agreed to adopt a road safety package. </PARA>
<PARA> The road safety package is a broad set of uniform road safety requirements. It will require changes to some States legislation including a 0.05 blood alcohol limit, national licensing of heavy truck and bus drivers, speed limiters for heavy vehicles, uniform national speed limits, a graduated licence system for young drivers and greater enforcement of seat belt and blood alcohol requirements. The Government expects that all States and Territories except the Northern Territory, which is currently considering its position, will adopt the package. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the number of road deaths has been reduced over the past 20 years from around 3,800 to 2,800 a year, the loss of these lives and serious injuries to another 30,000 annually is still unacceptably high. The Minister for Land Transport informs me that our State and Territory colleagues also share this view. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for all governments to take action to ensure that the road toll, which tended to plateau in the late 1980s, should begin to move down again. These programs will assist in achieving this. Indeed, I have no doubt that the public debate on the road safety package has contributed in no small way to the 14 per cent reduction in road deaths so far this year. The Government has also announced the establishment of the National Road Trauma Advisory Council. This body of eminent health and safety experts will provide advice to State and Territory governments on issues of national importance in all aspects of road trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will increase the scope and level of Federal assistance for urban public transport through the establishment of a separate urban public transport program. While legislation has, in the past, made provision for expenditure by the States on urban public transport projects funds were provided through the road program. States had the option of using a proportion of their arterial roads funds on urban public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will allocate $55m for its urban public transport program in 1990-91 and $200m over the three years of the program. In announcing the commitment of additional funds the Prime Minister indicated that they would be targeted at Australia's expanding outer metropolitan areas. These areas, which have poor transport services, will benefit from this program which will provide funds for capital projects such as buses, suburban trains and bus interchanges. In recognition of the transport needs of communities in our smaller cities and towns provision has been made for the funding of projects in these areas also. These approaches reflect the Government's concern to improve transport services for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has increased the scope of eligible urban public transport projects. Funds will continue to be provided for urban public transport projects which reduce wear and tear and congestion on urban roads. Funds will now be provided also for projects and programs which demonstrate new approaches to demand management and environmentally innovative solutions to urban public transport problems. A number of our cities are approaching the limits of traffic capacity and public concern over the environmental consequences of vehicle emissions is increasing pressure on governments to provide alternative forms of transport to the private car. The Government's urban public transport program will encourage change and innovation in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for funding the new programs outlined above will differ from those which apply to other Federal land transport assistance programs. Under the current arrangements all funds have been raised by earmarking a proportion of net receipts from excise levied on motor spirit and diesel. Funding for the new programs will be in addition to funds generated through the road user charge. These programs will be financed by payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund which will be paid into the trust fund which currently receives the receipts of fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for more funds to be directed at nationally significant projects by ending annual allocations to the States for State arterial roads. This category has provided assistance to the States for roads which are their responsibility. As governments acknowledged at the recent Special Premiers Conference, there is a need to rationalise road funding responsibilities between the three levels of government. The funding of State arterial roads is more properly the responsibility of State governments. Funds will be redirected by the Federal Government to the States for nationally significant projects such as national arterial roads, mainline rail upgrading and urban public transport projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Ending annual allocations to State arterial roads does not mean that road funding has been cut. With the redirection of some State arterial funds to national arterial roads and the establishment of the provincial cities and rural highways program, the Government is expanding both the size and the scope of its commitment to roads of national economic importance. It is expanding the set of national roads. States which already rank their road funding priorities in order of economic warrant should experience little change. Where States experience genuine short term difficulties in adjusting to the new arrangements there is provision for the Minister to transfer funds from other categories for use on State arterial roads. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill indicates the Government's commitment to a reformed and revitalised land transport sector. The three new funding programs will be allocated $178.3m in 1990-91, $168.3m in 1991-92 and $158.4m in 1992-93. This is a total of $505m over the next three years and is in addition to the Government's existing land transport funding commitments. The Government's total allocation for land transport assistance will be $1.611 billion in 1990-91, a 13 per cent increase in real terms over 1989-90 funding. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill defines the nature of future Federal interests in the provision of land transport assistance. The Government's traditional concentration on roads will be broadened to include the black spots road safety program and a new urban public transport program. Its road funding objectives, with the introduction of the provincial cities and rural highways program and the cessation of funding for State arterial roads, will further emphasise roads of national economic and social significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum are thus required from time to time to cover changes to Ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the cost of salaries and no more. While the Act covers the total cost of salaries it does not set the amount of individual salaries for Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, it is necessary to amend the Ministers of State Act to increase the limit on the annual sum appropriated to cover the increase in salaries as provided for in the Remuneration and Allowances Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Remuneration and Allowances Act was to alter the commencement of several increases for all parliamentarians with increases being phased over several stages. The Act also provided for linking the basic salary level for parliamentarians to the top of the Senior Executive Service band one in the Public Service. In its 1989 review the Remuneration Tribunal in report No. 2 of 1990 recommended substantial increases in salary for Ministers -increases for senators and members of this Parliament were also recommended in subsequent determinations. The immediate increase proposed for Ministers was disallowed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government had proposed in its submission to the Tribunal that in accordance with recent determinations for other groups in the Commonwealth sector, and consistent with the structural efficiency principle aim of simplification of salary structures, the Tribunal should incorporate expenses of office allowance for Ministers and parliamentary office holders into additional salaries. The principle of incorporating Ministers expenses of office allowance into salary is consistent with the Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases for senators and members were for 6 per cent from 1 July 1990, 6 per cent from 1 January 1991 and for approximately 5 per cent from 1 January 1992. There is a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of Ministers of State. That is Ministers' salaries are increasing in the same way that salaries of senators and members of the Parliament increase, that is from 6 per cent from 1 July 1990, by a further 6 per cent from January 1991, and by 4.8 per cent from July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> For consistency to be maintained with wage and salary movements in the community at large the Government did not adopt the full range of increases determined by the Tribunal. The national wage guidelines are completely met by the proposals adopted by the Government. With respect to ministerial salaries an ongoing link is established, as Ministers are to receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as members of the Parliament and phased in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the costs are significantly less than would have been incurred had the Tribunal's determinations been implemented in full. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) Bill gives effect to the renegotiation with the States of existing agreements on the provision of housing for members of the Defence Force. Under a series of agreements made between 1945 and 1979 the Commonwealth advanced funds to the States to construct houses to be used by Defence Force personnel. The Commonwealth was required to lease the dwellings at a rent which covered all State costs, including the principal and interest payments on the Commonwealth loans, repairs and maintenance, insurance and administration. Ownership of the houses remained with the States, with a State acquiring possession once a house was no longer required for defence purposes. As at June 1987 some 14,000 defence houses had been provided under these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreements were unsatisfactory in many respects. With ownership remaining with the States, the Commonwealth was unable to trade in the houses with a view to improving the quality of the defence housing stock. Additionally, the arrangements with the States could not provide the greater flexibility in defence housing that became necessary as operational requirements led to changes in the location of defence personnel. As far as the States were concerned, as the houses could not be returned until they were no longer required for defence purposes, they had no certainty that a house would become available for public housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government established the Defence Housing Authority in 1988 as the single agency responsible for meeting defence housing needs. With the commencement of the Authority, it was opportune to approach the States to renegotiate these agreements, with the aim of having the Authority assume control of all defence housing. Under the renegotiation terms offered to the States, the Commonwealth assumes ownership of 50 per cent by value of the agreed stock of Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Service Personnel) houses, with the other half handed back to the States. This handback is to be achieved over five years, with 60 per cent of handbacks to occur within the first two years. The renegotiation agreement deems the handback period for most States to have commenced on 1 July 1989. The outstanding debt on the houses is to be shared equally between the Commonwealth and the States. All States, with the exception of South Australia, have agreed to the renegotiation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill enables the Commonwealth to enter into the necessary agreements, obtain title to houses, and forgo half of the outstanding debt owed to it by each State. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the financial impact of the Bill. Agreement with the States will result in the transfer of housing assets valued in excess of $600m from the States to the Commonwealth. It is planned that up to 4,400 houses from the stock transferred from the States will be sold. Houses of equivalent value will be returned to the States. Some 4,200 houses will be handed back to the States over the first two years of the agreement, and around 7,000 over the full five years. Liability for debt totalling approximately $110m will be transferred from the States to the Defence Housing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The 7,000 houses to be returned to the States will require replacement. The bulk of these will be funded from the existing defence housing program. However, approval has been given for the Defence Housing Authority to borrow an additional $250m for housing acquisitions. A further 2,000 dwellings will be leased. The improved quality of the 7,000 replacement dwellings will result in the Department of Defence paying increased market rentals to the Defence Housing Authority. In the current financial year the part year effect is expected to be approximately $2.5m. By the end of the handback program in 1995-96, rent payments will have increased by approximately $24m per year. </PARA>
<PARA> The renegotiation will provide the Defence Housing Authority with title to a significant housing asset. Once it obtains title, the Authority will be able to trade in those houses. Over the five-year period of the agreement, 7,000 houses will be made available to the States for public housing. In all, this is a most satisfactory result. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill and the associated Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill 1990 is to provide the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) with the power to implement and administer schemes to control the level of exports of Australian meat and livestock to particular markets where the Board of the AMLC considers such arrangements would be in the best interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience with the live sheep trade to the Middle East highlighted a deficiency in the AMLC's powers in respect to its ability to impose and administer schemes controlling the level of exports. The AMLC for many years has had the power to administer quota schemes where limitations have been, or are considered likely to be, imposed by the Australian or foreign governments. This Bill will empower the AMLC to introduce also quotas on its own initiative where they are considered to be in the interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Because quota arrangements can at times result in windfall profits to exporters granted quota access, it has been decided to empower the AMLC to sell quota entitlement by auction, tender or other means so that part of the price premium can be recouped for use for the benefit of the industry generally. I would stress at this point that the AMLC will have the discretion to sell quota entitlement where it is considered appropriate. Where it is not necessary or appropriate it will continue to allocate quota without charge as it has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that all quota arrangements are equitable and seen to be equitable, the associated AMLC Amendment Bill has a clear requirement for all details of quota arrangements to be set out in the AMLC corporate plan, which must have ministerial approval. These details must be available to all exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate provisions are also included in the AMLC Bill to provide a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of AMLC decisions regarding the period of validity of a quota and variations to quotas granted. The AMLC will also be required to publish details of all quotas sold or allocated in its annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> This expansion of the AMLC's powers is in line with the Government's policy to encourage statutory marketing bodies to make the necessary commercial decisions to protect and foster the welfare of their respective industries. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wool Legislation Amendment Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 and the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964. These amendments, together with amendments to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964 which I will introduce shortly, will put into effect the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the business plan 1990-91 of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC). The Government's request to the Australian Wool Corporation for a business plan arose from decisions on the AWC borrowing limit which government took in September this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to remove the $2.5 billion ceiling on the AWC's borrowings was conditional upon the AWC presenting a comprehensive business plan to government. This plan was to provide details on how the AWC proposed to manage its potential financial exposure for the remainder of the 1990-91 wool selling season. The decision to lift the borrowings ceiling was also conditional upon the AWC presenting a strategic plan to government. The strategic plan is to outline strategies during the next three years for the financial management of the AWC and the associated financial risks of the proposed strategies for wool growers. This plan is to be presented by 31 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The main objectives of the business plan are, first, to contain AWC borrowing requirements; second, to hold grower equity in the market support fund at 50 per cent or more; third, to reduce wool production and increase trade clearances so that the AWC's stockpile can decrease as soon as possible; fourth, to implement strategies that are flexible and achieve the financial objectives of the plan, but which minimise as far as possible any adverse effect on grower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The business plan detailed recommendations to address those objectives and was presented to me on 1 October 1990. The broad thrust of the plan has been accepted by government and has received the broad endorsement of the Interim Wool Industry Policy Council. I announced the Government decisions on the plan on 8 October, having previously announced an increase in the maximum rate of wool tax to 30 per cent with an operative rate of 25 per cent taking effect on 4 October. </PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the legislative changes primarily relate to the implementation of the increased rate of wool tax; making provision for the possible introduction of a wool surcharge tax; the exemption of carpet wools from the wool tax and provisions of the reserve price scheme; making provision for the AWC to be able to use its funds on sheep disposal schemes; and support for growers disadvantaged by recent flooding. I will deal with each of these areas in turn. </PARA>
<PARA>Implementation of Wool Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The first aspect of the proposed legislative amendments is to increase the rate of tax on the sale value of wool. Members of the House will be aware that the rate of wool tax has been increased from 8 per cent to 18 per cent from 1 July 1990. This rate was then further revised to 25 per cent from 4 October 1990. The increase to 25 per cent was brought into effect quickly because speculation in the market about the prospect of an increase in the tax was adding to the pressure on the market and reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased rate of tax demonstrates the industry's commitment to the reserve price scheme and extends the capacity of the market support fund to support the purchase, storage and handling of wool by the AWC. It will also send a message to growers about the profitability of wool production. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of the higher rate of tax taking effect during a financial year the amendments also provide for the apportionment of the tax between the market support, research and development, and promotion components of the tax to be varied during the financial year. In addition, the present restriction of refund periods to whole financial years is to be lifted to provide additional flexibility to declare any specified period as a refund period. </PARA>
<PARA>Provision for Wool Surcharge Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In addition to increased rates of wool tax, this Bill provides for the implementation of a separate wool tax surcharge up to a maximum rate of 20 per cent. At this stage it is planned that decisions on whether to apply the surcharge, and at what rate, will be made in the context of the outlook for the 1991-92 season. </PARA>
<PARA> The operative rate of the surcharge will be set by regulation after considering the recommendations of the AWC. The surcharge, if imposed, will be revolved to growers after a period which I will determine in consultation with the AWC and industry representatives. To that extent, the surcharge tax is different from the basic wool tax. The imposition of the surcharge will reduce the AWC's level of borrowings, and will provide a disincentive to produce wool. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemption for Carpet Wools from RPS and Wool Tax</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect included in this package is the exclusion of wools of 32 microns and coarser from the market support component of the wool tax and from the reserve price scheme. These wools can be referred to as `carpet wools' because they are mainly used in the manufacture of carpets. The decision to take this step is a variation of a recommendation from the business plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government took the decision on carpet wools for several reasons. Australian carpet wools were facing severe competition as a result of importation of carpet wools at prices below the reserve price. This pressure, combined with the higher tax rate, meant that many carpet wool producers and the carpet wool cooperatives were becoming unviable. The Government found it could no longer accept a situation where carpet wool producers could be forced out of business as a result of corrective action to maintain the viability of the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The carpet wool industry produces only about one per cent of the Australian clip. It is not now, nor likely to be, a major supplier of carpet wool types; consequently, we do not set the world price for such wools. It should also be mentioned that our carpet wool is processed in Australia and some carpet is exported. The decision therefore complies with the Government's broader policy on domestic processing and value adding. I should note that several members of the House have written to me in support of the carpet wool industry's case. </PARA>
<PARA> Although carpet wools are no longer eligible to receive reserve price support they will continue to be included in other functions of the AWC. Carpet wools will remain subject to the research and development and promotion components of the wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Sheep Disposal Schemes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This aspect of the Bill provides for the AWC to use its market support fund for sheep disposal schemes. Sheep numbers in Australia are at record levels due to a combination of good seasons, high prices for wool, and the relative profitability of wool compared to wheat and beef. The Australian sheep flock is not expected to decline significantly this financial year. On the other hand, trade clearances of wool are forecast to rise only modestly from the 1989-90 season. Therefore the recommendation put forward in the AWC's business plan to implement schemes for the disposal of sheep in an humane and orderly manner has been accepted by Government in an effort to reduce sheep numbers and the supply of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to assure members of the House that disposal schemes will be considered with care. Animal welfare considerations will be foremost and funds will be available only for quick and humane methods of disposal. The possibility of an adverse impact on the mutton market is recognised and care will be taken to ensure that as far as possible the mutton processing sector has access to those sheep it requires. The level of expenditure in a financial year from the market support fund will require my approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Price Support for Flood Wools</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect covered in the Bills relates to support for landholders whose marketing of wool was delayed due to flooding in New South Wales and Queensland in April-May this year. Many landholders who experienced flooding were not able to either shear their sheep or deliver their clip for sale at auction prior to 30 June as they would normally have expected. As a result of this delay, their clip was subject to the lower reserve price as well as the increased rate of wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In an effort to maintain equity among wool producers, and in response to a request from industry, government decided that provision would be made for the AWC to be able to use the market support fund to make a special payment to those producers. The payment is to be equivalent to the difference between the price received at auction when the wool is sold and the old 870c floor price. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Issues in the Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The remaining issue covered in the package concerns meetings of the AWC. Current market difficulties for wool have resulted in the AWC board meetings being held at relatively short notice with not all members being able to attend. Provision has therefore been made for the Board to meet other than in person, for example, by telephone hook-up or closed circuit television. </PARA>
<PARA>Demand Building</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> All of the measures I have mentioned so far are aimed at the supply aspects of the industry's current problems and the short term financial management by the AWC of the reserve price scheme. This is because that was the primary focus of the AWC business plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Measures to improve demand for wool are of vital importance if the current situation in the wool industry is to be reversed and its long term future to be improved. Measures being undertaken by the AWC to lift demand include expanding targeted promotion and the co-development of new products through the International Wool Secretariat; continued emphasis on aggressive marketing in the Northern Hemisphere; extension of technical services to wool consuming and processing customers; continued negotiations to encourage a recovery in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and China markets; and consideration of credit sales from reserve price stock. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategic plan currently being prepared by the AWC will comprehensively address demand building initiatives. Later this month I am leading a trade mission to the USSR, China and elsewhere to further some of these initiatives and examine prospects for our wool trade. I will advise our customers of measures we are taking to address the significant problems we are encountering both with supply and demand. </PARA>
<PARA>Rural Adjustment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I fully appreciate that there will be severe hardship for many growers and their families. However we must not lose sight of the fact that some painful adjustments have to be made, and quickly, in the longer term interests of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear that the Government does recognise the enormity of the situation facing the wool industry and that adjustment assistance will be required. The situation is being monitored closely and I repeat that the Government is prepared to review the supply of funds under the rural adjustment scheme, including possible carry-on assistance and structural adjustment. The measures I have outlined are designed to boost badly needed confidence in our wool industry and in the market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I spoke briefly on this matter and I intend to return to my criticism of the Bills as being foreign to the general direction that the Government is taking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The package of Bills was developed by the beef cattle industry through the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council, an industry policy council set up in 1984. It spreads across a range of people and firms involved in production instead of just at the point of slaughter and at the livestock export stage. Payment is made every time there is a transfer of ownership. The reasons for the legislation are that there has been friction amongst the producers, processors and exporters about who is really bearing the cost of the existing levy system. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is important because it goes towards brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaigns, about 20 per cent of which is funded by the Federal Government. There is substantial funding from the levy. It goes towards the Exotic Animal Disease Preparedness Consultative Council which receives about 50 per cent funding from the Federal Government. It goes towards research and development. There is matching finance from the Federal Government for up to half a per cent of the gross value of production. Some abattoirs see the legislation as important to them and claim that it will keep them in local communities. Certainly we need to keep country slaughtering where it is fairly close to the suppliers because it means jobs in local areas and it also helps to keep business activity in local towns. </PARA>
<PARA> The three years proposed for this legislation to be on trial will give us time to ascertain whether the abattoirs are correct. I believe that there are other pressures on abattoirs and it would be surprising if the system that we are producing here today would solve their problems. It does seem to me that the Bill is another example of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and the Opposition spokesman bending over backwards to do what the industry wants. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament we see numerous examples of industry saying that it knows better than anyone else about what is good for it. I suppose one would often expect that, but the lesson for me in my time in this Parliament is that industry has sometimes been wrong. The wool industry seemed to me to be wrong when it said that it ought to have an $8.70 floor price for wool. Some people in the car industry seemed to be wrong when they opposed the reduction in the number of manufacturers. In both cases I think that the Government has been vindicated for its decisions. Though the pharmacy industry was originally right about the unfairness of a tribunal decision, it seemed to me that it was wrong when it failed to accept a $60m additional package from the Government in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> So apart from representing industry, government has to represent consumers, all businesses-not just the relevant industry businesses-taxpayers and even minorities in the industries being considered. The Bill is questionable on two of those four points. Taxpayers are not directly hurt, but consumers will be affected and some people in the industry are rightly objecting. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has to pay all the costs of the scheme. It has to recover costs eventually, I assume, from the consumer. It will take nine more staff to administer this-nine additional staff to those being used under the existing system. It is estimated to cost about three times the amount and the producers, the processors and the consumers will have to pay. I guess eventually it will be the consumer who will pay. The cost to producers and consumers combined will be about three times the present cost. It is probably not very high, I will admit, by the time the consumer pays for it. </PARA>
<PARA> We should also confront murmurings in the industry. Money collected will be kept for at least four to six weeks, bringing decent interest returns to businesses. But not all business participants are happy with this Bill. The system is complex and the levies are spread across production and involve different services. It depends on compatibility with the legislation of other governments and the differing requirements of the nine Australian governments with total legislation being dealt with by 15 chambers of Parliament in Australia. It is little wonder that there has been some conflict with State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the complexity is such that there are people in the industry who will be able to avoid paying the levy or transaction tax. The levy is based on a perceived average number of two and a half times an animal as considered to be sold in its lifetime. Sometimes, however, the animal may be sold farmer to farmer and no levy paid. It is hard to determine what proportion of the eight million sales involve sales from farmer to farmer. With levies no longer based on a charge at the point of slaughter but on charges right across production, there will be some sales where there will be no recognition or even awareness of levy obligations. Sales from farmer to farmer are one example. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales from studs may be an opportunity for conscious or unconscious avoidance. While stud sales are often through agents, they are often direct to clients. Having operated a stud for 17 years, I know that over half the sales did not involve agents-again, an opportunity for levies to be missed. I might say that agents who collect and account for the levy also would, I believe, have a problem with this legislation, particularly because smaller agents could find this a heavy, quite onerous and unpleasant duty. </PARA>
<PARA> There are areas and farmers that cannot take full advantage of the levies. They are expressing opposition to the Bill. Those producing backward stores and store animals may be disadvantaged by the passing of the legislation. The industry is trying to deal with this problem, a problem which could hurt some smaller agents. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a particular problem for all agents in New South Wales at the moment. It is clear that the six weeks for which the money is held will gain interest for agents unless they are licensed in New South Wales. If they are, they are required to place their funds into a trust account. So now we have to await a decision by New South Wales to free those funds for the intended purposes. Handlers' interest receipts must be a consideration in their coping with handling costs. New South Wales has legislation which requires funds to go into a trust account where agents are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill seems to me to be unwarranted unless it saves the closure of local abattoirs. We are giving the legislation three years to show its ability to do that. I suspect that there are other issues that we ought to confront when we consider the future of local abattoirs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is foreign to the general direction this Government is taking because it increases administration, it places more charges on consumers, it increases the complexity of regulations, it does nothing to reduce legislation and it increases escape routes for non-payment. It does expose the ongoing and costly problems which come from our federal system. In Australia in the 1990s, an essential element of legislation requested by an Australia-wide industry council is being stymied in one State because of that State's own peculiar legislation. Pending dramatic reforms to our federal system, we must await the pleasure of Her Majesty's Government in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally, governments should keep out of industry regulations as far as possible. Here we have an industry which believes that it can provide more fairness through more complexity. Time will tell. I am glad that we are only giving it a three-year trial. I am sceptical, but I accept that the scheme is on trial. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to join in this debate in giving some support to this legislation. My colleague the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) has already indicated the position of the coalition on this issue. As he and others have said, it raises funds, amongst other things, to finance not only the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), but also disease control, a national residue survey, promotion, research and development and so on. In the process of doing that, it changes the levy from a slaughter levy to a transaction levy. There seems to be a view that this is a slightly fairer and more effective system than the previous one was. Certainly, that is the view of the industry. I must confess that I have not examined that in enormous detail and, therefore, I am not able to comment further, in particular, on the remarks made by the previous speaker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to use this opportunity to pick up on the whole issue of what the AMLC does in this context of, above all, promoting Australian beef exports around the world. I will just make a couple of very brief points about that. I think 59 per cent of Australian beef is actually exported. Consequently, that function of the AMLC and the consequences of these levies are a very important part of the Australian beef and cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those exports raised $2.3m in export income in 1989-90. It is expected that in 1990-91 about the same value of exports will be achieved, although it is expected that there will be some decline in volumes. That is, of course, comforting for people involved in the beef industry because it is one sector of rural Australia which is not confronted with a collapse, at least in the short term, of the international marketplace. I want to say something about that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is interesting to note that it is expected that volumes will decline, in the case of the United States market, by something in the vicinity of 12 per cent. The explanation for that, according to the industry, is that there is growing competition from poultry in the United States. That is probably a reflection of the erroneous view that beef is bad for our health and that poultry, alternatively, is somehow very good. As many a medical specialist will now tell us, that is not necessarily the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese market has grown very effectively for Australia in recent years. It is worth noting, as did the Deputy Leader of the National Party in his speech, that from April next year the Japanese are to transfer their quota to, admittedly, a very high level of tariff-that is, a 70 per cent tariff-which will over a number of years then phase down. It is important as a Parliament that we recognise that small achievement by the Japanese. It is obvious that the domestic beef industry is very sensitive, politically and economically, to Japan, but it has had the courage to make changes to the import regime for that industry. In the longer term, that will very significantly benefit countries such as Australia which are efficient beef producers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that the Japanese are doing nothing to improve access to their agricultural markets. This is a good example of how wrong that view is. The Japanese are certainly taking steps which are helpful. This particular measure, the `tariffication' of a quota, as trade junkies would say, is without doubt a case of Japan setting an example to the rest of the world. `Tariffication' is a very important part of the Uruguay Round agenda, which was being debated a little earlier in the day in this House. Therefore, Japan has set an example which, I hope, many other countries will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very good prospects in the Korean market. It is believed that our exports of beef to Korea could grow by something like 13 or 14 per cent over this financial year. So, in general terms, when we look, in particular, at our important Asian markets, prima facie the prospects for Australian beef exports are relatively good. </PARA>
<PARA> The real risk for Australia-and this is really the burden of what I want to mention this afternoon-lies in the growing stockpiles of beef within the European Community brought about by a number of domestic problems it has had-by good seasons, by the incorporation of East Germany into what is now Germany and, therefore, into the European Community and, of course, above all by a very artificial pricing system in the European Community under the common agricultural policy, which encourages production without taking any account of demand. We should never lose sight of that. This is a quite appalling state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> This growing stockpile in the European Community, which, it is said, at the extreme could assume dimensions of some 600,000 tonnes by the end of the year-it will probably be substantially less than that, but, in any case, it will be a very large stockpile-poses something of a threat in the medium term to the Australian beef industry and is something that we need to think about very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as access for the Australian industry to the European Community is concerned, that is something that has really gone by the way over a number of years. I remember that 10 years ago when I worked in the Australian mission to the European Community we had a beef quota of about 10,000 tonnes of high quality beef-or, as it was known in those days, Hilton beef, as though the beef that one gets in Hilton hotels is of a higher quality than anywhere else; I am not sure whether that is true. In any case that 10,000 tonne quota has now gone down to 5,000 tonnes which, in terms of our total beef exports, is a negligible level. Given that we can export beef substantially more cheaply into the European market than those countries can produce it with their highly subsidised and artificial common agricultural policy, it still remains a matter of regret that we have such a small quota. The Australian Government should still continue to argue with the Europeans that we ought to have greater access to that market on the basis of price competitiveness and quality. I do not criticise the Australian Government for what it has done in that respect. It has made those points to the Community; but we need to keep making those points. </PARA>
<PARA> The greater concern is that the European Community will start using its notorious restitutions, its export subsidies, to flood the international marketplace with the surpluses that it is gradually accumulating. The consequence of that will be not only a threat to the markets that we have been building up so laboriously over recent years but also a general reduction in the overall international price for beef products. Of course, this is what has happened to the wheat industry, although to some extent that is the fault of the United States of America's export enhancement program and not exclusively of the Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of beef it really would be the last straw for Australia if we were found to be losing beef markets and if beef incomes were to decline simply because of subsidised exports from the Community. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), who is at the table, must be given credit for participating in the successful Andriessen agreement in, I think, 1985 or 1986 under which the Community guaranteed not to export subsidised beef onto the Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Singaporean or Malaysian markets; there may have been one or two others. That agreement has held up very well over those years. </PARA>
<PARA> But the concern, not to put too fine a point on it, that we now all have is that the Europeans, and in particular the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr MacSharry, are taking a perfidious view of this agreement and are now contemplating a breach of that agreement by exporting their subsidised surpluses onto those markets. If that were to happen it would be just another contemptible act of economic vandalism by the European Community. More than that, it would undermine what residue of goodwill is still left in this country towards the European Community in a commercial sense. Certainly I suspect that we on this side of the House would join with the Government-the Government has already drawn attention to its concerns about this-in expressing our outrage should Mr MacSharry, the Commissioner for Agriculture, get his way in breaching the Andriessen agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to say that when I have raised this matter with the European Community and also some of the governments of the member states of the Community, they have been able to reassure me that they think it is highly unlikely or unlikely in the extreme that the Community itself or the member states, the Council of Ministers, in particular the council of farm Ministers, would agree to a dissolution and a breach of the Andriessen agreement. It is important that we bear in mind the danger that that could happen; subsidised beef exports from Europe into those Asian markets would do crippling damage to beef producers and to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to suggest to the Government that it does one more thing, that is, to take one stage further the Andriessen agreement as it currently stands and negotiate formal agreements with those Asian countries, ideally starting with Japan, under which those countries would agree not to import subsidised exports of beef from other parts of the world. In particular, if we were able to formalise that with the Japanese, it would give the Australian beef industry much more security than it has at the moment. Certainly, if we could extend that to other countries in the region, that would be all the better. Some people say that the Asians would not be very willing to do that on the grounds that they would rather be able to import beef cheaply and live with the benefits of the foolishness of the European subsidies, which are, of course, subsidies by European taxpayers and consumers to Japanese or other Asian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, that is not a bad argument. But I would counter it in two ways. First of all, under the Andriessen agreement those countries are not at this stage getting the benefits of such subsidised exports. Secondly, those countries, in particular Japan, have a very clear interest in ensuring that we have a proper and fair international trading system. They gain nothing in the long term by aiding and abetting a corrupt international trading system which allows and encourages export subsidies from one part of the world to another. They have a vested interest in a fair international trading system and they can play an important part in ensuring that that system is a fair system by taking up the sort of initiative that I am proposing today of entering into this kind of agreement with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister at the table and the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett), who at the moment is over in Geneva, to examine the prospects of being able to formalise an agreement of that kind with Japan and other parts of the Asian region-the countries covered at this stage by the Andriessen agreement-to give us and our beef industry that much greater sense of stability and security. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the coalition is happy-certainly I am-with this legislation and we look forward to seeing how the new levy system works in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1990 has been introduced to provide more equity within the industry. The way in which the levies were applied in the past gave rise to disputes and were, to coin a not inappropriate phrase, a bone of contention within the industry. That bone of contention has created friction between the various players within the industry. On the one hand are the producers and on the other the processors and exporters. Each section of the industry has believed that it was carrying burdens which were, to say the least, unfair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current levy arrangements for cattle, sheep, buffalo and goats consist of a flat rate per head livestock slaughter levy at the point of slaughter and a flat rate per head livestock export charge. As I have said, these levy raising mechanisms have been a bone of contention within the industry and a cause of friction. The major dissatisfaction arises from the question of who actually bears the cost of the levies and the charges. Both the producer and the processing and exporting sectors believe that they are bearing those full costs. This dissatisfaction has increased as levies have risen substantially in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Bill and the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill do is to provide mechanisms which will attempt to ensure that there is a clear and agreed statement of who should pay the levy and at what point it should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill is to impose a levy on the sale of cattle and transfers of ownership and transfers from production to processing where no sale has actually taken place. The Bill also provides for due dates of levy to be prescribed by regulation. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) argued, this will allow flexibility in the collection of moneys by permitting different collection periods depending on the amount of money to be collected and the sector of the industry from which it is to be collected. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of the dairy industry in the north coast electorates I want to emphasise that dairy cattle traded for dairy purposes are to be exempt from the transaction levy and from the export charge. It is important for honourable members to understand quite clearly that these proposals have come from the industry after a great deal of discussion and debate; they are not just imposed by the Government on an ad hoc basis. The charges are meant to provide some equity within the industry and to ensure that those people who should pay do pay. </PARA>
<PARA> The new levies will yield revenue about equal to that yielded by the present arrangements. As the Minister said in his second reading speech, as the Commonwealth recovers all of its costs incurred in the collection of levies and charges, there will be no net effect on Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements are designed to reach what the industry sees as a more equitable and visible division of levy payments between producers and processors by making clear their contributions and responsibilities. Although the new system has been instituted to provide equity, it is important that it continue to be under the surveillance of the industry and government. It is probable that the new levies, however, will not result in a more equitable spread of levy contributions over all industry participants because market forces will continue to determine where the final impact of the levy falls. However, the industry believes that the degree of visibility contained in the new arrangements will result in less friction between industry sectors and serve to unite the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which the revised levy arrangements for cattle and beef are implemented are likely to yield confidence in the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council's effectiveness in the development and implementation of policies. The present proposal has set an experimental collection mechanism and provision has been made for a three-year trial period for the new arrangements. Indeed, the current levies and charges can be reinstated up to 30 June 1990 in consultation with the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I must be blunt with honourable members by saying that in my electorate office in Richmond on the far north coast of New South Wales I have had some significant correspondence from some sections of the industry which have understandably argued a separate case from that of the wider industry. As one person argued, the new system has some problems for the north coast of New South Wales. North coast producers have difficulty in getting cattle to the fattening stage and, between the dealer, the feedlot and the grower, may incur a levy three to four times. </PARA>
<PARA> Some have argued for an ad valorem rate related to the value of cattle at the time of sale rather than a flat rate. They have argued that problems arise at the service killing establishment because the operator regards the dollar value of cattle coming through as private information. The proponents of an ad valorem tax would argue for a `checkback' system where buyers are paid the value less one per cent all the way through to the abattoir where the money is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> However, despite problems and doubts, the proposed system has the overwhelming support of the industry. The ad valorem tax might in theory be more appealing but in practice it is more costly to collect and is more open to manipulation by people who set out to minimise their payments. For example, with the growth of the feedlot industry it is possible for an integrated establishment running breeding stock to reduce weaned calves which are then moved to other properties, to a feedlot and on to the abattoirs without really changing hands. The question then arises: what is the value of the animal at the time of slaughter? It becomes apparent that, under an ad valorem system, it might be possible to avoid the incidence of levy by never having a value placed on the animal. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that to impose an ad valorem system would add significantly to the cost of collection because more staff would be required and more problems relating to the value would arise. For ease of administration, the flat rate levy as proposed by the industry will produce fewer hassles for those involved in the industry. Nevertheless, the options have still been left open. There will be a continuous monitoring by both government and the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the present proposal has come from the industry through the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. It presents a united view of a complex policy issue. The purpose of the Bill is to impose a levy on cattle sales, transfer of ownership and transfers from production to processing where no sale has taken place. It is of concern to people in my electorate, to people running abattoirs and to people involved in the export industry out of the electorates of Richmond and Page. </PARA>
<PARA> People have also indicated their pleasure at the fact that separate rates of levy are struck for adult cattle and for bobby calves, and both rates contain separate components for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Council, the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign and the national residue survey. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the rates of levy may by altered by regulation but specifies the maximum rate of levy that may be imposed. I commend the package of Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by declaring my interest because I am a small cattle breeder. I want to speak to these seven pieces of legislation-the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill, the Beef Production Levy Bill, the Cattle Export Charge Bill, the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Cattle Industry Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Bill-because I believe that they are very important indeed to the cattle people of Australia. One has only to hear the speakers from the Government side who, I am sure, are passing on to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) some of their constituents' concerns. Coming from the New South Wales coast myself, I have similar concerns, although, as a member of the Opposition, I will certainly support the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been explained by speakers before me, we are moving from a slaughter to a transaction levy for the industry. We appreciate that this has been brought about principally by the fact that the slaughterhouses, the abattoirs, and the processing side of the industry have been very concerned because they feel that they are taking the responsibility for the payment of the levy. I can see their point. I do not condemn the legislation but I know that over the years the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, as well as other members of the Government, and the Opposition, have been trying to build up the beef industry in Australia. I was pleased today to hear the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) speak of the fact that we live in a country which has less chemical residue than any other land in the world, which is a very big thing. The fact that we have almost eradicated tuberculosis is another big achievement, the financial responsibility for which the Government has shared with the growers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are reaching a stage now where the Government would like to put the total financial responsibility for all the inspections and eradications back on to the grower himself. I think it is unfortunate that it has now made this decision because our primary industries overall are facing such very sad economic futures. Admittedly, beef is not as bad as wool and grain but our fat cattle-mainly fat prime cattle-are bringing little more now in the market than they did four, five or six years ago. Store stocks may be more expensive but this measure will cut profits back to those who buy stock in the saleyards, grow it and then fatten the beasts for sale. So it is that the beef industry is not as profitable as we would like to see, although our market opportunities, particularly with Japan, will get better, I am sure, next year, particularly when Japan takes over as our major importer-actually replacing America. </PARA>
<PARA> The operative rate that is proposed within the legislation is $5.83 with a maximum of $12.25. Bobby calves will be $1 to $2.25. Overall this is possibly a lower charge for stock than that operating at the present time. I want to deal with a few of the nuts and bolts of the matter because I have been spoken to by growers within my area and by auctioneers, who are the ones responsible for the collection of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak of the auctioneers because a stock and station agent in any town is a very important person. If we look back in history we will find that in Australian country towns auctioneers were the people that the farmers went to for advice-not only on farming, but on many matters, even marital matters. They were always there to value and give advice. Within my own electorate of Lyne we never forget them. Those people are still there. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of work in the conduct of a country sale. People have to book their cattle in. The auctioneer usually owns the yards, unless local government does, and the yards have to be kept in order. The cattle have to be cared for. If there are sales in the yard and the sales are on Monday, people have to bring cattle in on the Sunday afternoon. They have to be there to sell early on the Monday. Most of our major country towns have fairly big saleyards. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that the auctioneers and stock and station agents are the people who have to cope at the present time with all these further restrictions that the Government is placing upon the cattle industry-and maybe the sheep industry; I am not so conversant with the sheep industry. People bring their cattle and bobby calves along. We might get only a dollar for a calf but it is either 40 kilograms killed weight or 80 kilograms live weight. Who is going to determine the weight of the bobby calf? This is the practical side of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be necessary for the agents to put in scales just to weigh the bobby calves when they are brought in for sale. The auctioneer must also check the cattle for their tail tags, particularly in New South Wales. He must attend to many things. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) mentioned this afternoon that in New South Wales the levy must be placed in a trust account, and approval must be received to withdraw the money from the trust account. I doubt whether the Minister has considered these matters. I know he has been under pressure from the Cattle Council of Australia and from the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, but has real consideration been given to what the reaction to this measure will be? I do not think it will be successful. At a walk-in, walk-out sale of a property-and quite a lot of these take place-there might be 10,000 head of cattle. Let us say that the prescribed levy is $6 each. That means that $60,000 must be paid into the fund. </PARA>
<PARA> What about private sales? Will a ranger or a stock inspector from the Pastures Protection Board have to go out into the field to check on the numbers concerned? I say to the Minister that this will create the greatest bureaucracy that we have ever seen. That is what we want to avoid. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, another eight or nine people will have to be employed. Who is going to pay for this? There is only one person who will pay for this, and that is the grower. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the restrictions that we impose-and I know they are necessary-must be handled properly and put in their proper perspective. That is why I think the Government has not given sufficient time for the measure to be considered, even though it has been recommended by the responsible organisations. As the honourable member for Murray said, this matter should be delayed for a certain time-at least 12 months-until it is properly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> I can certainly appreciate what the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) said because, like me, he represents a farming and cattle area. The north coast of New South Wales is a nursery so far as stock are concerned. We are the ones who breed the cattle. The people from the west, the tablelands, from Victoria and Queensland, come to buy them. Many of the stock that they buy will change hands not once but three or four times, which affects the amount of tax that will be paid. The cattle buyers on the coast are basically the ones who set the floor price for cattle and keep it at a certain level. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very important matters. I hope the Government realises this because Government members now represent two of the important electorates on the north coast of New South Wales. As I said, this area is a nursery for stock. Stock buyers come in their dozens-cattlemen from the west of the State, from Victoria and Queensland. That is why we are very concerned about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cattle Council and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation would agree with this measure because basically the ones who will be helped by the legislation are the blue bloods of the industry-in other words, the person who has a fair amount of acreage who is able to breed his own stock, who is able to grow and fatten the stock and sell direct to the meatworks. There is no second or third turnover in that regard. That person does not have to go through an agent-luckily for him. He is the one who will really prosper. I hope that those people who have advised the Government on these seven Bills are not those who represent this type of person. </PARA>
<PARA> Within my electorate-and I am sure that my colleagues on the Government side will agree with this-there are a lot of farmers. I do not believe that governments, either State or Commonwealth, are paying sufficient attention to what people on the farmlets are doing. We should not stop a person subdividing his or her land. People should be able to do this, simply because their farm represents their superannuation. This is an important point. I am sad to say that the New South Wales Government is looking at the coast and saying to the councils, `This land will be set aside permanently for agriculture'. That might sound good in principle, but we are talking about people's land. This area is experiencing growth in tourism and aged people are retiring there. As I say, a farmer can double the return that he will receive if he is allowed to cut off a couple of blocks. I know of a typical example where this is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to encourage these people either to grow trees, fruit or vegetables or to run a few head of stock or horses. Who will check on these people who sell a steer or a female beast to their next-door neighbour? They have only to put it through the gate. Such people might be honest enough to say, `I have sold one, two, three, or four beasts'. But that will not be the case. As this proceeds we will see more rangers, more inspectors and more control being imposed around the countryside in order to check on people. That is the last thing that the farmers want. They are complaining now that these are bad economic times. We do not want to impose something else on these people which will worry them. We are worrying our pensioners every time that another change is announced in a Budget. It is affecting the health of these poor old folk. What is the Government going to do to the farmer-cripple him and put him down, too?</PARA>
<PARA> We must take a realistic look at this matter and be sensible about it. The legislation before the House concerns me from the point of view of the imposition on the stock and station agent, the auctioneer and the farmer. I am not talking so much about farmers with larger properties; I am talking about the multitude of small businessmen-and that is how I class these people-who are very important to Australia. We want to help them to utilise their land and keep them there. That is why I have spoken about the farming side. I am not talking about those with five acres; I am talking about those with 10 acres up to 100 acres. At the moment land is going to waste. They say, `There are restrictions on what we are able to do'. They have to pay their Pastures Protection Board rates, and they object enough to doing that. They say, `If we rear three or five beasts, we have to pay tax on them'. I am pleased that dairy stock have been excluded, but the culled cows will not be excluded, nor will the poddy or bobby calves. The dairy farmer will send most of his calves to market, and he will send his culled cows to market. So the dairy farmer is involved, as well as the grazier. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the points that I wish to raise because they are the practical things that we are concerned about with regard to farming. I hope that the Minister will have another look at the situation and, as the honourable member for Murray suggested, delay the legislation for 12 months. </PARA>

It is a very difficult proposition to determine exactly how we are able to maintain some of the richest agricultural land. At the same time that land is owned by individual people in a free society.

<PARA> As we fly into large cities such as Sydney or Melbourne we see that some of the best agricultural land has now been built on. If there is a way we could arrest that it would be great. It is a difficulty because people should have the right to determine what they wish to do with their own property. It is a very hard problem. The honourable member for Lyne was 100 per cent correct when he raised that concern. It is one that Australians will have to grapple with, as have people in the United States and Europe to a greater degree because they have larger populations. Perhaps we can learn from some of the lessons and measures that may well have been successful in years gone by over there. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal for the new arrangements was developed by the industry and basically came to the Government through the annual general meeting (AGM) of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. This structure was introduced by the Government to facilitate the participation of industry in the development of industry policies. The new arrangements have been developed by the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council, which has been termed the AMLIPC. The AMLIPC is a statutory body established by the Government in 1984 to provide a forum for industry-wide consideration of industry issues. It brings together the leaders of industry with producers, meat exporters, processors, wholesalers and retailers with unions and domestic marketing interests being well represented. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic mechanisms that are proposed in this Bill include a per head transaction levy on all cattle sales and deliveries for slaughter where no sale has taken place, a beef production levy on a cents per kilogram basis and an export charge based on the live weight of exported cattle to replace the current per head charge. These three levy charges will replace the present livestock slaughter levy and export charge. The proposals are designed to achieve what the industry perceives as a more equitable and visible division of payments between producers and processors by clarifying the relative contributions to the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC). </PARA>
<PARA> The initial levies have been struck so that producers and processors share equally the cost of funding of the AMLC and the AMLRDC. We understand that this will apply throughout the three-year trial period of the new arrangements. The AMLIPC believes that there is consensus within the Council on the issue and that any objections from outside bodies have received detailed consideration. The Council is also aware of and willing to accept the high collection costs associated with the proposal. The industry accepts that the lesser degree of audit in some minor collection areas, requested by the AMLIPC as a cost containing measure, may result in some leakage. I believe that the proposal has some positive aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> The implementation of the proposals will increase industry confidence in the AGM policy council structure. The provision of seemingly more equitable arrangements has the potential to decrease internal disruption in the industry. Allowing the industry to determine its own levy collection mechanisms increases the degree of self-determination and responsibility within the industry. Individual producers will become more aware of the industry funding of statutory bodies and the effects on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I wish to take up is that as a part of this package the AMLIPC has also recommended the restructuring of the register of livestock producers established and maintained by the AMLC. Producers entered on this register are entitled to vote at the industry's annual general meeting, along with those persons entered on the register of processors and exporters. The producers' register is to be divided into two registers, one for cattle producers and one for producers of sheep, buffalo and goats. The processors' register will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the points made in the debate by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) were very profound. I think he indicated concerns that we all have with regard to freer trade. I want to touch on the aspects of some of the markets we have. Currently a high level of stocks of beef at wholesale prices, coupled with high retail prices, is creating some uncertainty in the Japanese beef market. However, liberalisation of the Japanese market offers some considerable longer term benefits, but nothing is ever achieved easily when we have to break through protection. Recent trends in Korea indicate that the market is expanding and offers some good prospects. It is our third largest export market for beef and took some 58,000 tonnes, valued at $148m in 1989. In Taiwan it is a little bit harder but again, as I said, we will have to keep on pushing the line. </PARA>
<PARA> We have more to gain out of free trade than any other nation because we have such a small population and we rely so much on overseas markets for our primary products. We have to sell something like 80 per cent overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the other members who spoke on the Bill-the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and Opposition members-have basically covered the full ambit of the Bill. I support the seven cognate Bills. </PARA>

<PARA> The Bills are intended to spread more evenly the burden of financing the operations of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation and the funding of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign and beef promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall thrust of these Bills, as has been stated by various members of the House, has been agreed to by the beef industry and the dairy industry. They have been the subject of very lengthy debate throughout the beef and dairy industries and the sheep industry for a number of years. I certainly still have concerns with the thrust of the Bills. However, the industry has decided that this is a better way to go. The sheep industry, however, will not be moving to this form of levy. It is staying with the slaughter scheme. That is despite strong support for a change which came from the processing sector. These Bills are coming before the House and they are going to be tested and looked at over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity this afternoon to point out how important the beef industry is to Australia. If we look at the statistics we will find that the beef industry in Australia is a major income earner for this country. In fact, it contributes $2.3 billion of foreign exchange annually. I quote there the 1989-90 Budget figures. It is the largest exporter of beef and veal in the world. Our Australian beef industry is a prime example of something that we do extremely well. We do it extremely competitively and we have some of the best and most residue-free beef in the world. That is all credit to the beef industry because it grappled with many of the problems of a residue crisis a few years ago. I know that it will look at this transaction levy proposal in the Bills that we have before us. I believe that if the proposal is wrong, the matter will be readdressed in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at some of the figures of the Australian meat industry, we see that the volume of beef and veal exported in  1989-90 amounted to 672 kilotonnes. Of that total volume of beef, we exported to the United States, which is one of our most important markets, 334 kilotonnes and to Japan 186 kilotonnes. The average price was $US2.72 per kilogram. So it is an important industry. Of course, those figures reflect the importance of those exports to the nation and to each and every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to look ahead and see what the outlook really is for beef and veal. We slaughtered almost eight million head of cattle in the last 12 months. Some of the consumption figures in Australia are worth noting. The average consumption of each and every Australian is 41 kilograms per year. So it is a major source of protein-and, of course, a very fine source of protein-for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I go to the slaughter levy, as we currently know it, and then to the transaction levy. Currently, the slaughter levy is being collected at the point of slaughter by the processor. It is the responsibility of the processor to forward those proceeds to the Government and then through to the industry. So we are in fact moving away from that slaughter levy, although the slaughter levy legislation will remain in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The transaction levy, as it is known, will be payable on store, prime or stud sales. The transaction levy differs from the original slaughter levy, because the slaughter levy was imposed on all cattle that were processed at meatworks. It was certainly very easy to administer. There were no leakages, because beef hanging up is clearly identified, whereas the levy we are moving to is going to be much more difficult to identify and administer. So the transaction levy will be payable on all store and prime cattle that are sold and all stud sales. In the past, none of those cattle have been subject to the slaughter levy, except in the case of prime cattle which are moved straight to the meatworks. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Bill the levy will be paid on all cattle by the owner of the cattle at the point of sale. The levy will still apply to vertical integrated systems. In other words, if a producer owns a feedlot, a meatworks, or a small butchery through which he processes cattle, he will pay that transaction levy prior to the cattle being slaughtered. He will also pay a levy on a per kilogram basis if he has a vertical integrated system. </PARA>
<PARA> One area that worries me is that of private sales, which will in fact attract this levy. Many private sales are transacted from property to property. One area of concern is that of sales of property, particularly in the more remote areas of Australia, where stock is sold as part of a property on a walk-in walk-out basis. The only figures that can be obtained are the figures on the books, not the actual numbers. It is just totally impractical to imagine that, out in the Channel Country, every beast there will be counted and that the levy that is due will be paid. So an area in private sales is certainly a worry. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area where the levy will be paid is at the point of slaughter. This will be paid by the owner of the cattle-in this case, the processor on a per kilogram basis or the retailer. For this to be successful, a very important part of the administration is the collection of the levy. As I said, the slaughter levy was collected at the point of slaughter; it was very easy to administer. But I believe that, to ensure that the levy is equitable and that there are no leakages, this will create some headaches for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Where store and stud sales take place, the selling agent will collect the levy. In the case of private transactions, where the sale has not been transacted through a third party, the levy will be paid by the vendor of the cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> There are exemptions, and these have been agreed to by the industry. Any dairy cattle traded for dairying purposes; sales or deliveries of cattle between related companies, unless the company buying or taking delivery of the cattle is a processor-in other words, deliveries between properties owned by the same company-and sales or deliveries of cattle to a processor if the cattle are not fit for human consumption will be exempt. Of course, we may see in the area of leakage some cattle that will not be fit for human consumption, although I know that owners have good intentions in that regard. Another exemption will be where there is a change in ownership of cattle because of proceedings under the Family Law Act 1975, the death of an owner or a change in a partnership. Also exempt will be where the levy has already been paid on a bobby calf. I believe that the administration of these exemptions will create some problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned that there will be a three-year trial for these levies. It is important that the existing slaughter levy remain as an Act of Parliament, because during this three-year trial the levies will be thoroughly tested by the industry. I do not believe that we should necessarily say that the Bill will be reviewed only in three years time. I believe that after 12 months we should be taking a very critical look at the levy structure, how the levies are being collected and the areas of leakage that may exist. If it is wrong, it is important that we just do not go on for another two years with those wrongs still in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> There are clearly areas which could create a leakage, particularly in the area of private treaty sales and barter trading. In Australia's current economic climate, we will see much more barter trading. That might sound crazy, but it will go on. If people can keep a few more dollars for themselves over the next three years by using the barter trading system, they will. It is an area where some of the smarties may get away with not paying the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area is the miscalculation and identification of differing descriptions for cattle, particularly in the area of walk-in walk-out property sales. Clearly, areas exist there where those who want to be clever will in fact look to avoid what they are meant to be paying. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we should be looking at this very objectively in saying to ourselves that we are not going to let this review run for just the three-year term, we will be looking at it in 12 months time to ensure that there are no administration areas that could not be tidied up. There is certainly a further reason that I should like to cite right now in the Parliament and that is the area of auditing of the books because this is a most important aspect of the collection of this levy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the agents who will be collecting the levy on behalf of the industry and they will be able to keep that money for up to six weeks, so that there is no cost to the agent; they have been certainly opposed to the introduction of this transaction levy. They will be able to claim the interest on that money as a way of compensating them for collection of that levy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly, as the honourable member for Lyne says, they will put up their commission fees. So there is another reason of course that the industry will have to be very vigilant in watching exactly what is going on. But it is very important that we ensure that the collection of this levy is equitable because we are moving away from a system which clearly identifies a beast at the point of slaughter to one where there has to be a lot of counting of heads and a lot of descriptions of calves, bobby calves or adult beef and so on, and we want to ensure that there are no unscrupulous operators out there who may keep the money for more than six weeks and make money out of the industry quite unfairly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also in 12 months the industry will certainly need to look at the levels of tax on the animals-the rates of tax which are applied in this Bill. The industry will need to ensure that those rates are appropriate. There will certainly be an increase in the cost of the collection over and above the slaughter levy. As the honourable member for Lyne rightly said, it will build a bit of a bureaucracy to administer this and it will be a nightmare, and we do not want bureaucracies around for three years and not being able to address the issue. So we will have to certainly look at the cost of collection-that it is still a better scheme and working in the best interests of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly the industry has debated the measure and sees benefits in it. Certainly the industry said that the new system will be more equitable than the slaughter levy. As I said, we should look at this in 12 months time to ensure that it is more equitable, and we must look at why the sheep industry has not gone down this path. That industry believed the levy would not be more equitable but the beef industry has said, and all sections of the industry has agreed, that the levy is more equitable. </PARA>
<PARA> The other benefits are that the levy will for the first time be visible, whereas in the past the old slaughter levy was on account sales but it really was not clearly visible to everyone. So for the very first time industry funding to the beef industry will be clearly identified and it will be clearly paid and shared by all those who enjoy the profits that come from the beef industry. So that is an advantage in favour of the transaction levy. Let me just sound a cautionary note: we must be very aware that we should look at this measure in 12 months time. As I said, it has been debated by the industry and accepted and let us hope that it will work. Let us give it our best shot. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet with a few minutes remaining, there is one other subject I should like to touch on and that is the increase in the inspection charges. I am pleased to see the Minister at the table this afternoon because I believe it was quite unfair in these economic times that we are facing for the Government to increase in the last Budget the inspection charges by 40 per cent. The Government did that without any consultation with the industry and, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) quite rightly pointed out in his speech on this Bill, the Government should have another look at this matter-it is not too late-and defer this decision for a further 12 months and take another look at it because this is clearly not the time to impose a 40 per cent increase in the collection levy for inspections, given that the industry has no control over the inspection charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has no control over the staffing levels and this is an area that the Government must look at urgently, given the economic conditions we are now facing. Where we have a bureaucracy deciding that the industry can afford it, the bureaucracy has set the rules yet it does not pay the bills. So I would ask the Minister to look at that 40 per cent increase that was imposed in the Budget. It will raise an extra $44m of revenue in the next 12 months. I believe that money should remain in the industry whilst the Minister consults with the industry and decides whether that is really fair, especially when one looks at other beef industries around the world. For example, in America they pay the full cost of inspection charges on behalf of the industry and if one looks at that debate, one will find that they see it as a reason--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listed myself belatedly to speak on this matter because it is one of increasing concern to me especially in times when most of our livestock industries are in quite dreadful trouble, although, admittedly, the beef industry is probably the least in trouble of those. Agriculturalists, beef, sheep and wheat producers, all wanted their little bureaucracy, and then that little bureaucracy wanted to be a big bureaucracy. Of course as the grains industry discovered, it was the only industry that did not seem to have a fund that it could play with and be taken out to lunch by various merchant bankers and others wanting to teach it how to invest money. Well, of course, the industry got very disappointed about that and in the end it got such a levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This problem concerns me because for the life of me I do not really know what the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC), which these cognate Bills are all about funding, does for the beef industry. I have met a number of Corporation executives, most of whom knew nothing about beef when they were appointed. They may have known something about marketing but to tell the truth, I have my doubts about that because I have always found that the things that I wanted to sell were either best sold by a commission agent because there was something in it for him or otherwise by myself. </PARA>
<PARA> When somebody, friend or otherwise, said he knew that someone wanted to buy something from me and I left it to him, generally he never made the sale-the incentive was not there. I am not really sure that the AMLC-and I should think it is the least popular of all the sorts of market income agricultural industry bureaucracies-has ever done anything. We have been through a remarkable situation in recent times with the live sheep industry and we have had a bureaucracy there that did nothing much more than turn around and say, `Well, the easiest way to resolve the problem with the Arabs is to stop sending them sheep'. </PARA>
<PARA> We are trying that in the wool industry at the moment. We are telling the countries of the world that the best thing we can do is not let them have our wool and that will teach them a lesson, but they do not seem very concerned about it. The fact of life is that they are just letting us stand up wherever we can find some room and they are going on with their business, buying it, I might add, in such places as Argentina and South Africa because those countries are meeting the market. But that is not the subject of this particular debate so I will get away from wool, although it is grown on sheep, which are very much a part of the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So, primarily, I would wonder why the Parliament is spending so much time imposing further levies on people who produce cattle so that we can have a thing called the AMLC. You may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that shortly after the Corporation believed it had done some sort of deal in the live sheep industry it discovered that an exporter, who actually had a shipload of sheep on the ocean but which did not meet the Corporation's exact new specifications, whizzed it into Saudi Arabia as soon as trade was reopened. </PARA>
<PARA> That gentleman sold the sheep, notwithstanding that they did not meet the new specification; consequently he was banned. That did us a really good turn! He now sources all his sheep out of New Zealand and sells none for us. That was a very good promotional effort by the AMLC on our behalf as meat producers. Somebody who in these difficult times knew how to sell sheep to Saudi Arabia was driven away. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a wonderful specification was written that said only three-year-old wethers were required. I never wanted to sell the Saudi Arabians three-year-old wethers; I wanted to sell them six-year-old wethers. I used to like shearing three-year-old wethers. They were very valuable on the property. We had no need to sell them while they were producing wool at some sort of price. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not for a government bureaucracy to decide that I may sell only three-year-old sheep to the Saudi Arabians when I want to sell them six-year-old sheep. I will sell them dirt cheap. A lot of Saudi Arabians wanted cheap sheep but someone in the system thought that by selling them more expensive sheep they would eat less. Instead of telling us we could export only three-year-old sheep, I would have thought the people who wished to be funded in the way set out in these Bills might have found it a good idea to go over there and talk the Saudis into taking six-year-old sheep. I accept that dealing with the Arabs is not a simple business transaction, but if these people want all this money I would think they would be good at dealing with them. If they are not, they should find someone who is. </PARA>
<PARA> My objection to these Bills is that we are funding people to talk. As I had to remind certain people in the wool industry a little while ago when they were telling the Parliament, and more particularly the Government, to keep out of their business when it came to the price of wool, if the Government had not passed a law to collect their tax, how much would it get? How many wool growers would line up and pay the wool tax? None. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that without the involvement of government and the Parliament, levies are not paid. That is some indication of how much individual farmers like these systems. We know we have bureaucracies, and to a degree rural socialists, who think it is a good idea, but even they would not put in the money unless there was a law to make them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Parliament asked itself why these levies continue to be imposed on farmers and others. They would not impose them on themselves, yet they come along to the Government and say, `We want you to impose this levy'. During the wheat debate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said he would impose a 2 per cent levy on wheat only with industry approval. That approval came from the Grain Council of Australia, which had sold him the idea in the first place. The Minister regarded that as the industry. I am a wheat grower and I do not like the 2 per cent levy, but unfortunately the Minister did not ask me. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry is made up of many people, but they are seldom asked about these things. There are various grower organisations to which some agriculturalists pay membership; a large percentage do not. These representative groups invariably are elected by some collegiate system; they are never really voted for. </PARA>
<PARA> These are serious problems. The first question is: Should we support this legislation on the fundamental issue of keeping the AMLC alive? I suggest to the House that if we did not support the AMLC and it went away, the beef industry would go on as it did before. Of course there would be some hassles. For instance, there are concerns with marketing. There is not an agricultural industry that is not cyclical. As with the wool industry, we can look only at trend lines. If one looks at the cotton industry, for instance, as I did recently, we see the returns to growers going up and down. When we put in the trend line we see that there has been some reasonable growth in returns. It is tough one year and good the next. That is agriculture. We have learned that in trying to smooth out those bumps we get into more trouble, and the AMLC has not done much in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I must also express concern as to whether this form of funding is appropriate. Some 20-odd years of my life were spent in station country. A station basically has no value. It is a pastoral lease and what is sold is the livestock that are on it at the time of sale. That is the value of the property. Now I understand that under these present arrangements if one has 20,000 cattle on a property and the property is sold for what is the market value of the cattle, and that would be less than in the sale yard, then each one of them will be subject to this levy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good question. I know a few people who bought properties and found the count was not as it should have been. Sometimes they get shipped out the back door. They are big properties and the new owner can walk in one end while the truck is going out the other. Perhaps they are the ones that should have the tax paid on them. This seems to be a huge imposition on the sale of a property, remembering that the State government is there with its hand out for stamp duties and other charges that go with a sale of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure that that sort of transaction should be taxed. In addition, I am not sure about a lot of transactions such as the sale of stores cattle, for instance, which frequently come off these properties. Although I have had some discussions today with processors, who assure me that those taxes at present come out of their profits, I tend to hold the view that when they go into the market to buy, they are very conscious of their costs, whether labour costs or other costs, and they bid accordingly. Admittedly, it is sometimes necessary for them to bid up. </PARA>
<PARA> It was pointed out to me that the current value of a live sheep delivered to some works is about 80c, yet we have a levy-not the meat inspection levy but a levy similar to the one we are discussing today-of 56c. The levy now is often more valuable than the sheep. There is no flexibility in these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other aspects of the meat industry that concern me. We still have too much inflexibility in the rights of meatworks to export, and I wrote to the Minister recently about this. We have a new regime in Western Australia which is creating a few problems because it is another upgrading, another intrusion of bureaucracy into the business of turning livestock into meat at an economic price. We now have what is known as a coded works, which is somehow a little less than an export works. The proprietor of one of these works has pointed out to me that he can sell meat to the best restaurants on the North Shore of Sydney or at Berowra Waters. His meat meets all those inspection standards, but he cannot sell to Sri Lanka or Indonesia, where from my observations the local health standards would hardly meet those of a restaurant on the North Shore of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> In these times when we are desperate for exports and desperate to sell as much surplus mutton as we can-we are still shooting it on the properties-we should look at how we as a Parliament can make it economical to do so. Some of the smaller meatworks do achieve economies because they are not as bloated by bureaucracy as the big export works and they could meet some of the markets that the bigger works cannot. That factor should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the coded works still have local government inspectors. I have explained to this Parliament time and time again that they are cheaper. The proprietor of one of these works has told me that he has an excellent arrangement with his local government authority. It literally charges the inspector out by the hour. The local ratepayers or the council must be picking up some of the costs, although the council probably uses this fellow as a health inspector, so it is not so disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was addressing myself to some of the problems associated with the statutory marketing authorities, one of which we are reorganising the funding for, namely the AMLC. I had also started talking about some of the other problems associated with the meat industry at this stage of the game, particularly the fact that we have a rash of these levies and how they can be so inappropriate when looked at in the light of the value of some of the product. I am told that mutton is now worth about 42c a kilo in the boning room and, of course, that does not put a huge value on a sheep, particularly a ewe, yet we are still levying a charge on the meat industry of 56c. That, of course, is mutton whereas this legislation deals with beef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my final few minutes, I would like also to take the opportunity to address myself to some of the general concerns I have for all the charges that are affecting our opportunity to export meat at a time when Australia has a surplus of mutton and yet in that process the cost of turning an animal into meat is not being reduced. In fact, I am told by Western Australian representatives of the meat industry that the meat workers are presently seeking a $150 a week wage increase at a time when it still pays to send a carcass of mutton to Russia rather than bone it out and put it in a box. That is quite heartbreaking. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking of value added in this country; we desperately need it, yet it does not pay to bone out a carcass of mutton in this country. It is a pity that the industry itself and the workers within the industry cannot see that is a problem. Interestingly, I heard an industrial relations spokesman say the other day that there are two problems with the meat industry. One is that the wages are lousy and the only thing worse than that is productivity. Is it not a pity that the workers cannot see that there might be a better way to get what they want. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue is meat inspection costs. I point out that in Western Australia where State inspection through local government is still retained it is cheaper to have local government inspectors than Commonwealth inspectors. They both have exactly the same qualifications. The Government is setting out to recover 100 per cent of the cost, and strangely enough I am not an opponent of 100 per cent cost recovery. But I am a very violent opponent of the Government's setting the cost. My view is-I am on record as putting this position to the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry that occurred some years ago-that meat inspectors should be the employees of the works and they should be paid wages commensurate with their abilities and, of course, suffer all the other problems that the other meat workers would suffer if the works closes down. </PARA>
<PARA> Their Queen's Counsel attacked me for putting forward this dreadful thought of private enterprise people being able to decide whether the meat was worthy of being exported. I asked him how he had got to Perth, as he was from the eastern States. He replied that he had flown in an aeroplane. I asked him who he thought declared that aeroplane safe to fly in. Of course, it was a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer employed by whichever major airline he chose to fly with. To tell the truth, I would prefer integrity in the fellow who said that the plane was going to get me from point A to point B without crashing than in the meat inspector whose decisions might determine whether I got a tummy ache over a bit of meat. The reality in both cases is that we can maintain integrity, but of course government, as it does in the aircraft industry, has a role to play. As the export orders lay down, the Federal Parliament is responsible for supervision-not for meat inspection, but for supervision. </PARA>
<PARA> In more recent times the Government has got away from a charge per beast and gone to hourly, daily, weekly and annual rates for a meat inspector. The cost for a Federal inspector for a day is $185 and for a year $38,420 at 60 per cent of the fee. An Opposition member said earlier that there is a 40 per cent increase in the fee proposal. No, it is a 66 per cent increase because we are going from 60 per cent to 100 per cent. As I say, I would have no objection to that if the Government had a proper user pay policy that said, `Look, we are going to put at our cost a supervisor into your very large works or we are going to have a roving supervisor covering a number of small works. That is the end of our responsibility. If we come into your works and find you are not employing the appropriate number of meat inspectors or they are not doing their job properly then the question is whether you retain your licence'. That should be the end of it. They are not even employed under the same award; many of them get an hour's overtime every day because the meat workers are rostered to start at 7 o'clock but as public servants the meat inspectors do not have to start until 8 o'clock. It is just so ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things can be covered, but time has never been so important. The price of our meat is so low we cannot afford many of the levies and many of the bureaucratic intrusions we have. I make a plea to the Minister to look very closely at how we can remove a little bit of government in the interests of selling a bit more meat to the world because we have heaps of it, but other countries do not want to pay much for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank all honourable members who took part in this debate on the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill and cognate Bills. Most of the comments were very constructive; many of them were seeking information; some of them were quite plainly wrong and if I get a chance I will address them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) raised a lot of issues connected with the inspection charging system, which is not what this Bill is all about at all. Those questions were well meaning and I think I should spend most of my comments addressing them. First he said there was no consultation on the move from 60 per cent to 100 per cent cost recovery. Of course not-the Bill was a charging Bill in a Budget context and I can understand what the attitude of people who pay would have been. It is in the nature of Budgets for governments not to tell people if they are going to put something up. </PARA>
<PARA> Another charge was that the industry does not have control. It has a fair degree of control and knowledge of all this and I will go into that if I have time. Some of these requirements are determined by our customers. The United States Department of Agriculture determines the standards to be used basically for all the meats that are exported to the United States, Japan and, for that matter, Canada. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) bureaucracy does not set the rules, although a lot of other people are involved in it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another charge that was made is that the United States pays the bill for all this. Yes, it does. That is because export meat is a very small proportion of the total amount of meat that is inspected in the United States. It is mainly domestic inspection. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party asked what does the 100 per cent cost recovery include. It is made up of all amounts appropriated by the Department of Finance for the functions involved in providing quarantine inspection services, plus costs contributed in employer contributions for superannuation, which is a computed figure supplied by the Department of Finance. From that base are excluded costs associated with servicing government and costs of quarantine surveillance-that is about $11m in 1989-90. There are a lot of other concessions as well as these regular exclusions. For example, excluded for three years is the cost of the current $1.8m and proposed $2m support for quality assurance and related arrangements. Excluded also are the costs of subsidies for small slaughter establishments; for two years the cost of staff to implement revised charging arrangements; and also reducing the cost of the Commonwealth's contribution to superannuation for field staff to 15 per cent until 1 July 1992, which saves AQIS clients $6m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party also said there is no provision for industry to challenge costs or charges. That is exactly the reason that I set up the Quarantine and Inspection Policy Council. An extensive review process is undertaken by the Parliament, the Department of Finance, the Auditor-General's Office and other independent organisations, all about AQIS's costs and charges. Since the announcement that cost recovery would be extended to 100 per cent, AQIS has undertaken an extensive consultation process with industry bodies to discuss in full the format of AQIS charges, inspections and administrative procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Deputy Leader of the National Party, 100 per cent cost recovery should be deferred until a more efficient inspection procedure is in place-for at least 12 months. Since the early 1980s we have put enormous emphasis on reviewing current practices and implementing initiatives to improve the service to clients. To date these initiatives have resulted in a reduction of almost 600 positions. If we get all these savings in place, we will save something like $44.5m in the total charging base and some 826 staff. So the percentage of recovery is going up but we are really bringing the costs down quite enormously. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be best if I communicated to the Deputy Leader of the National Party the initiatives we have taken. It is not as if the bureaucracy or any of this is just rumbling along. The present Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the previous ones, Senator Cook and my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), have put an enormous effort into getting those charges down. We are still continuing that task. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the National Party raised the point that inspection services are unreliable as evidenced by recent industrial action at the Brooklyn abattoir. That action lasted two hours. Generally the problem is in the meatworks as a result of the activities of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union, particularly in Victoria. We have lost hardly any time over the past five years and we have that industrial record at a time when we have dropped 550 people out of the service. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party was that inspectors should be employed on a hire and fire basis. They are currently employed under the Public Service Act, but when the northern isolated meatworks are taken into account, how the heck meat inspectors can be casual employees there, I really do not know. There would be a very rapid diminution in available inspectors as they sought employment in more stable and predictable vocations. It is a heck of a problem, but whilst we have seasonal works in remote locations, there is really no way we can get away from having people as permanent officers, particularly when they need to be accredited and when our customers need a Commonwealth government health certificate. As I said, I will try to convey this to the Deputy Leader of the National Party because he is asking genuine questions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the whole Bill which we are now discussing, rather than inspection charging. I said at the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council (AMLIPC) that the reason the Government did that was that the industry's politics-this classic clash between processors and producers-was being fought out on the Board of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC). I said that the Council was getting away from its major task which is the facilitation of exports-not selling; that is done by the trade-promotion and some of the other minor functions that it is involved in. The Council also now has additional tasks associated with Ausmeat and computer aided livestock marketing. That is the reason why I set up the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. On the Policy Council's own initiative it raised this whole question of the levy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a slaughter levy. There has been an ongoing debate in this industry for as long as I can remember on whether the producers or the processors actually pay that. The reality is that it depends whether the market is rising or falling because at the end of the day market forces will determine who actually pays. It has been wisdom in the country for a long time that we have to find a new system so that the charging is more equitable. It is all about this; it is all about pass back. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Policy Council went through this issue; I forced it to go through it. That is part of the reason why this proposal is in for only three years. I made the Council go back and back again. It is not, as the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) said, that we gave lack of consideration to this. My personal views do not come into this. At the end of the day the stock and station agents are still opposed, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) recalled. Dairy farmers had all sorts of problems. Eventually they somewhat reluctantly accepted the concession on bobby calves. </PARA>
<PARA> Many cattle producers, despite what the organisation is saying, are also opposed to it. Some of them did not know what it was all about and some of them probably still do not. Others take a more pragmatic decision based on their evaluation of how it suits their particular property. For people with big cattle herds, it works fine. For others it does not. The breeders are in a different position from the lot feeders. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme is more expensive. It is more administratively cumbersome. There will be more leakage, less auditing and a lot more trouble with it. Rather than looking at it again in 12 months time, I can see quite clearly that there will be a need for amendments through these next three years. There are particular problems with Tasmania and New South Wales, as instanced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and we will have to look at this quite a bit. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not imagine that the industry will fundamentally reject this in the near term because it will give it a chance to settle in. Eventually the Government had to take a decision on whether it would accept the advice of the industry's own policy council. We accepted it on the basis of the AMLIPC's assurance that there was a consensus within the Council on the issue and that any objections from outside bodies had received detailed consideration. We accepted it on the basis that the Council was aware of and willing to accept the higher collection costs associated with the proposal. We accept that the industry accepts that there is a lesser degree of audit in some minor collection areas requested by the AMLIPC as a cost- containing measure that may result in leakage. The industry knows these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that the new arrangement may not necessarily achieve the goal of greater equity. My view is quite clearly that market forces will continue to determine where the levy falls. The proposal has several positive aspects. Implementation of them will increase industry confidence in the annual general meeting and the policy council structure. The provision of a seemingly more equit- able arrangement has the potential to decrease internal disruption in the industry. It will allow the industry to determine its own levy collection mechanisms and increase the degree of self-determination and responsibility within the industry. Individual producers will become more aware of industry funding of statutory bodies and the effects on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the package has the full support of the cattle producer and processor organisations-the big groups in the industry-but is opposed by some individual producers on the grounds of cost and by stock agents in some States, particularly Victoria, mainly on the basis that the agents will be required to provide significant clerical services in the collection of the transaction levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The agents have suggested more recently that the transaction levy be collected by way of the cattle producer's income tax return. Again this option was considered by the AMLIPC but was rejected. The Australian Council of Livestock Agents and the Cattle Council of Australia are still negotiating the question of the period that agents will be able to retain levy funds to compensate them for the costs of collection. I think the discussion there centres on whether it should be 30 or 60 days. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this has been a very long debate. The Government finally decided to accept the advice of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. As I said, I am not particularly prepared to put forward my private misgivings on the question. I believe that at some time those people who pay need to know what they are paying for and what they have agreed to. I think it does give meat producers much greater knowledge of their own industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) raised several matters. I agree entirely with what he said about the stockpiles of beef and the need to retain the Andriessen agreement. He failed to mention that part of the stockpile in Europe is due to consumer perceptions that some meat is infected with mad cow disease. The problem in Europe with meat is the gutlessness of the politicians there. The fact that the conservative political parties-and in France the socialist parties-prey on the peasants and the farmers leads to the ridiculous situation where French farmers burn sheep alive because there are British sheep 20 miles across the Channel. Really, it is a failure of politics and politicians to get people to face the fact that farming is not so special that one can have two tractors, a nice lifestyle, drink lots of beer, own eight cows, carry around a couple of cans of cream and think that one's day's work has been done. It is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mayo also suggested that we need to deal with the Japanese directly. I do not want to get into these issues. We have very good relationships with the Japanese. We do not have that much leverage in many ways. We do not want to get into resources diplomacy. The push and pull of direct investment in this country and what is coming from that as the Japanese beef market opens up all provides grist to the mill in this debate. I am not rejecting what he is saying. In many ways, as we get greater understanding, greater involvement with other economies, interdependence, money flows and all the rest of it, a lot of these so-called deals will come to pass in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) touched briefly on a crisis rally. I might as well put paid to some of the things that he said. More importantly, farmers in that area and National Party people set up this crisis rally there. That culminated in a press release from Senator O'Chee last night which was pretty wrong. A long time ago I agreed to address a meeting on science and technology in Emerald in Queensland. Someone must have heard about that because, quite coincidentally, there was going to be a crisis rally. I was not invited to the rally, but the headlines came out that I was going to address the rally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is what I said. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) said that producers want their own bureaucracy, that he does not know what the AMLC does to sell more beef, et cetera. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation does not sell beef. It is only a facilitating body. He should read what the AMLC does, either in the annual report or in the Acts. I do not think that it is the least popular of the statutory marketing authorities. I really do believe that it has done a very good job and is now more accepted than ever before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member then went on to speak about the live sheep trade. I must say that it is the trade that has done a lot of damage to the trade, but I will not go into that. He mentioned one of the exporters-cum-importers who went against what was written on his export certification and who changed the destination. The ownership of the sheep changes the whole time as sheep sail across the ocean, but this exporter went against his export certification and the Meat and Livestock Corporation had to make a decision with respect to that person. That person does pick up sheep from New Zealand now, but the reality is that New Zealand cannot deliver sheep in the long haul. On the very first trip, 10,000 sheep were lost. New Zealand is not seen as a really big supplier of sheep in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA> The AMLC wrote a very long specification, as the honourable member for O'Connor detailed; that is true. That was to reinvigorate the trade with Saudi Arabia. That was necessary. The AMLC did not say that sheep must be three-year-old sheep; the Saudi Arabians decreed that in about 1980. I think that part of the reason we have problems with that country is that the trade largely ignored the decree. Saudi Arabia is a country that is governed by decrees. It is a monarchy, and we have to take that into account. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the honourable member's criticisms of statutory marketing authorities in general are addressed in the Davis committee report, which will come before the Parliament. I believe that I am trying to get as much commercial freedom as possible and make producers face up to annual general meetings and all such cumbersome things that they do not like, so that they really do have to make their own decisions rather than pass all decision-making to the AMLC or the Cattle Council of Australia, leave it at that and then continue to nitpick. I am trying to remove these organisations from government, and also trying to make people make their own decisions about these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also instanced trade with Sri Lanka. The problem there is that we cannot let local meat inspectors do the job, because we cannot control where that meat is resold to and from. It is not just a question of a meatworks shutting down because it played against the rules, as was evidenced with the organochlorin scare. The whole trade becomes at risk because of a handful of crooks. The number of fraud control measures we still have to put into place for this whole industry is absolutely enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman also mentioned productivity. There are quite a few breakthroughs in productivity in the meatworks coming. The Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU) in Victoria has chosen to export most of the meat industry out of that State. I believe that there will be a great recapitalisation of meatworks in this country and that we will get quite large productivity gains throughout the meat chain. Again, I do not have time to go into all of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that I have said enough. I will communicate or try to communicate directly to the honourable member for O'Connor because I think that he raises substantial issues that need answering and, similarly, I will do so with the Deputy Leader of the National Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill 1990 marks, I regret to say, another instalment in the never-ending battery of legislation in broadcasting that we have come to expect in recent years. It is worthwhile reflecting that this Bill is, of course, not the only current piece of broadcasting legislation floating around. As of 25 minutes to 9 on Wednesday night we have on my tally: the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) which are presently in the Senate; we have a swag of amendments to the latter of those two Bills; we have the current Bill before the Parliament and we are apparently tonight going to have even a further amendment to that Bill. I say that with some hesitation because at 8.20 p.m. I was given a solitary supplementary explanatory memorandum but no proposed amendment to the Bill. So we have a supplementary explanatory memorandum to an amendment to the Bill, which amendment we have not received. I do not know whether any other member here has received this further amendment. I do not know whether the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has it or not. Perhaps he will tell us; as the explanatory memoranda in these matters are not all that crystal clear on every occasion, as the evening wears on perhaps we may be taken into the Government's confidence as to what this new amendment is to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If that were not enough, as well as these pieces of legislation, we also have, because the Government legislates in part by press release and by speech, what I must concede is a very interesting speech by the Minister given to the recent conference of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, which contemplates even more wholesale amendments to the broadcasting laws of this country. That is what we have at the moment, and no doubt we will have further amendments to the broadcasting law as the remaining weeks of this year unfold. I am not of a complaining nature, but I say that simply because it makes it very difficult to have six balls in the air by way of amendments to the broadcasting law. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot help but feel sympathy for those who have to interpret this law and apply it-both those in the industry and others who take an interest in broadcasting. There are frequent and regular changes to the law, so much so that after the last election even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was driven to describe it as nightmarish legislation, one of the few things I can recall the Prime Minister saying with which I agree. </PARA>
<PARA> But one cannot help but observe sadly that the Government has done nothing to improve the nightmarish legislation, indeed has done nothing to change the situation other than to add a few more nightmarish instalments to it. The nightmare is getting longer and worse. One really waits with great interest and expectation for when dawn will arrive and the nightmare will be over. But I fear to say that, on all the evidence available to us at the moment, the nightmare shows all the indications of continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the purpose of the Bill is to fix, in effect, in a permanent way-in so far as anything in this field of the law is permanent-the level of foreign investment in broadcasting licensees at 15 per cent for one foreign investor and at 20 per cent for two or more foreign investors in the companies that hold licences for the broadcasting of commercial radio and television. A short extract from the Minister's second reading speech makes it plain that that is what the Government seeks to attain by this Bill. Let me just repeat what the Minister said in part of his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA>The Broadcasting Act's current rule prohibiting control of a broadcasting service by a foreign individual will continue. This means that any individual foreign person or company, that is, a company more than 50 per cent owned by foreigners, will never be allowed to have actual control or a level of direct or indirect interests exceeding 15 per cent in an Australian licensed broadcaster.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Bill prevents contrived schemes which, under provisions introduced in 1981, make possible foreign equity levels far in excess of the 20 per cent aggregate limit through complex company structures. The Bill reintroduces tracing of indirect foreign interests in broadcasters, using a proportional tracing mechanism, to ensure that aggregate direct or indirect foreign ownership of Australia's broadcasters is strictly limited to 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, I think it is fair to say that that extract from the Minister's speech makes it reasonably plain that what the Government wants to attain by this Bill is to set in concrete the 15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, limits on the percentages of foreign ownership that may be held in broadcasting licensee companies. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be opposing this Bill but we will not be opposing it because of the 15 and 20 per cent limits themselves; we will be opposing the Bill for other reasons. The 15 and 20 per cent limits are already in the Broadcasting Act; they will remain there and will not be affected at all in their precise terms by the Bill that we are debating tonight. In other words, the 15 and 20 per cent limits, in the cases, respectively, of one owner and more than one owner, will not be affected by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who are interested, the provisions of the Act which set those percentages out are as follows. First, there is section 90g, which deals with commercial radio stations. Those who are interested may look at section 90g (2), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). They set out the 20 per cent limits which are expressed to apply for the case of two or more foreign persons. That, as I have said, is with respect to radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to television stations, we find the 20 per cent limit set out in section 92d. This applies to commercial television stations, and if we look at section 92d (2) (a), (b) and (c), we see the three cases which set out the law expressing the extent of foreign ownership that may be held by two or more foreign persons. You may ask, Mr Deputy Speaker: what about the 15 per cent? That really is one of the mysteries about this Act. People quite readily throw the 15 and 20 per cent limits around but one will search section 90g and section 92d in vain for any expression of the 15 per cent. In so far as I can work it out, the 15 per cent seems to come from section 89k of the Act, which is in the same part of the Act and which seeks to give a description of those who are in a position to exercise control. We are told, in the curious language in which this Act is expressed:</PARA>
<PARA>For the purposes of this Part (other than subsections 90g (2), (5) and (6) and 92d (2), (5) and (6), a person who . . . is in a position to exercise control of more than 15% of the general meeting votes in a company . . . shall be deemed . . . to be in a position to exercise control of that company . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Presumably that means that, for the purposes of this part, including subsections 90g (1) and 92d (1), which are the two sections we are talking about at the moment, a person is deemed to be in a position to exercise control of the company if he owns 15 per cent of the general meeting votes in the company or, to be more precise, if he is in a position to exercise control over them. I just make the remark as a sideline that, if I am interpreting this Act correctly-and it is a very brave person who claims that he does-it is a very curious situation when--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beazley" NAMEID="PE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And when they do, they make their fortunes.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do, yes. Some make fortunes; others would like to make fortunes interpreting it but do not have the opportunity to do so. It is a very curious situation, when you come to reflect on it, that, as I read the Act, one person who controls 15 per cent of the shares is in control of the company but two people who control 19 per cent of it are not-that is, either two who jointly own 19 per cent or one who owns, say, 15 per cent and one who owns 4 per cent would not be in control of the company. That seems on the surface to be a little peculiar but one gets used to oddities and eccentricities in this Act. Indeed, on reflection, it is probably part of its charm that so many eccentricities are contained within it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaving that aside, the situation is that the Act, somewhere or other in its totality, contains the 15 per cent limit on foreign investment for one shareholder and 20 per cent for two or more foreign shareholders. That is not being changed by the Bill. In other words, there are no amendments to sections 90g or 92d other than by adding to them, and I will deal now with what is added to those sections because that is the substance of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> What has changed here is in effect an addition of provisions that will become sections 90ga and 92da, applying respectively to radio stations and television stations. Those new sections will in each case add what are called provisions for the tracing of foreign interests in voting shares through a series of companies. In other words, it deals with tracing provisions so that people can trace through a series of holding companies to get to the ultimate ownership. In addition to that provisions are added to the present Act which seek to limit the number of foreign directors. As well as attempting to limit the foreign ownership, and tracing that, there are limits on the number of foreign directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I make an aside to say that it is a bit curious that, having gone to the extent of putting in all these complicated tracing provisions which I will do my best to explain later on, this additional provision with respect to foreign directors itself seems to create some new loopholes. The burden of the new section dealing with foreign directors is that a licence is subject to a condition that at least 80 per cent of the directors of the company are Australian citizens. That becomes a condition of the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> One may well ask in this situation: What if they are? But they are mere amanuenses, or alter-egos of foreign owners and foreign directors-de facto foreign directors. What is the situation there? Will we before Christmas this year have yet another amendment? The Minister nods, and I suppose that is a promise. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beazley" NAMEID="PE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you actually do find any holes, yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in the business of looking for holes in the Bill, but I simply say that once one embarks down this road and puts in provisions to the effect that at least 80 per cent of the directors of the company must be Australian citizens, does that not immediately raise a question, as is the case on occasions with people in less developed countries? We get some retired Army colonel and prop him up on a board table as a director and say he is a local citizen, but all the time we are on the phone from Sydney or New York telling him what to do: `Put your hand up. Put your hand down'. Is such a person really a local director? Not in any real sense of the word, so my guess would be that sooner or later-and probably sooner-there will be another amendment to the Act to cover that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leaving the question of foreign directors aside, this Bill endeavours to deal with a problem that is set out in the explanatory memorandum. Those who draw explanatory memoranda have at long last given up trying to express these things in words and they now put them in diagrams. Diagram 2 on page 8 seeks to explain what the problem is with respect to this industry which is sought to be resolved by the Bill. This diagram, to illustrate the evil which this Bill seeks to address, shows four foreign investors called F1, F2, F3 and F4. They each own 10 per cent of a holding company and that holding company owns 100 per cent of the licensee company. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of the whole argument-for those who do not want to read the Bill or who have difficulty with it-is that that is an evil which has to be attacked with a sledgehammer and smashed into oblivion, because if it is not smashed into oblivion immediately, by this heavy handed and complicated piece of legislation which will provide board and lodging for most lawyers in Australia for the next 12 months, the broadcasting industry is going to grind to a halt.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe-and this is our case-that this is a great exaggeration and there really is no need for this piece of legislation. That is the evil which is set out in diagram 2, because the situation in that diagram is presently not a breach of the law. People may well ask, `Why should it be a breach of the law? Is it all that dreadful that there are four foreign investors, each of whom have 10 per cent of the shares in a holding company?'. I make the comment by way of an aside that 60 per cent, the majority, are still owned by Australians in that case. Is it really such a dreadful situation that it needs to be stamped on, banned, put to death, burnt at the stake, or whatever it is that the Government is trying to do with it? Is it really necessary to do that? We would have very grave doubts. In any event, that is the situation which is sought to be rectified by the Bill. Without going on at length about it, I think one can say that that is it in a nutshell. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government tries to do is to resolve this by saying, `We will set up this complicated series of tracing provisions', which of course need more illustrations, diagrams and complicated formulas to explain them. Once again, one can say that a simple way of describing what the Government is doing by inserting the tracing provisions is simply this: for instance, where company A owns 10 per cent of company B, and company B owns 50 per cent of a licence, under this Bill company A will be deemed to hold 10 per cent of the 50 per cent because it had 10 per cent of the company which owns 50 per cent of the licence. Therefore, it is said, it holds 10 per cent of 50 per cent, which is in fact five per cent of the licensee. That is then followed through in various permutations in the Act and that is the result. One presumably then adds them up and if they come to more than 20 per cent, one says that the licence is in the control of foreigners and all sorts of invalidity consequences follow from that. I hope I have explained both the problem which is sought to be addressed and the solution which is sought to be set up to solve that problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, we oppose this Bill and we oppose this way of solving this problem basically for five reasons. The first reason, as I have already said, is that the situation which is described in that diagram as the evil is really not so serious that it calls for the sort of heavy handed solution which is adopted in this Bill. As I said, in the illustration in the explanatory memorandum, a majority of shareholders in that case are, of course, still Australians. If one can say, `Here is a broadcasting company which has held together at a time when a lot of those companies are falling apart', and that broadcasting company has 40 per cent foreign ownership, is it not better to keep it standing, albeit with a degree of foreign investment in it, rather than have it fall to the ground as unfortunately is the fate which a lot of people feel, we hope wrongly, is what lies ahead of some engaged in the media industry? That is the first reason-that the situation is not all that bad. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as I have said also, the Government really is using in this case a sledgehammer to solve this problem. It is not necessary to do so in such a heavy handed way. Thirdly, we do not resile at all from the situation that there may well be a case where foreign investment is justified and there may well be a case where more than 15 per cent and more than 20 per cent is justified. Does it mean that the company is less Australian? Certainly not, because the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal lays down standards on Australian content and, after all, there is a very big discipline-which the Labor Party, of course, never accepts-that is, the discipline of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that viewers and listeners in Australia expect to see and hear a good, healthy dose of Australianism, Australian programs, on television and radio. If they do not get those, they will tune to a different station. That is a very powerful discipline, and owners of broadcasting companies, whether they are foreigners or Australians, know that, in the instance of television, if they do not show some Australian programs, and a good, healthy dose of them, they will not have viewers for very long. We say that there may well be a case for foreign investment. It does not mean that just because there is foreign investment that it is going to be an unAustralian station. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is justification for foreign investment, is it all that dreadful? We would rather see the industry survive, even if it is necessary to have a substantial element of foreign investment in those companies which operate within the industry. We would certainly rather see those companies survive with that degree of foreign ownership and foreign investment than see them collapse without it. There is a very great temptation these days to be jingoistic about foreign investment in the media, as elsewhere, and to haul the flag up to the top of the mast and say, `We are pure, decent Australians'. What people forget is that foreign investment in the industry is valuable and useful. People also forget that with foreign investment one gets foreign expertise, access to foreign programs and access to the foreign interest in one's station, and that can be an enriching experience for Australian viewers.</PARA>
<PARA> The fourth reason we object to it is that these tracing provisions were in the Act until 1981 and they were taken out when we were in government. In effect, they are now being put back. There is a lot to be said for consistency-here at the margin one might have to have an argument about the merits of these individual issues-so that people know what the rules will be. It did become known that one could go beyond the 20 per cent limit through holding companies. Everyone knew that; it was common knowledge. It was written up and spoken about widely and known in the industry. But no, we are going to put the clock back now through this Bill to put back these tracing provisions after taking them out in 1981. We say that that really is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth reason is a separate reason, quite apart from all the others. The amending provisions in the Bill will themselves be amended tonight, but basically the legislation also gives power to the Broadcasting Tribunal to turn a blind eye to breaches which are so important that they have to be rectified by this Bill. I would have thought that members of the Labor Party would take the view that that sort of thing-if it is a crossroads issue-really should not be left to members of the Broadcasting Tribunal. They are not elected. They are no more repositories of Australian sentiment than members of parliament. Irrespective of what side of the line one comes down on in terms of merits, surely this is something that should be determined by the Parliament and not left to unelected people who are members of the Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> For all of those reasons we oppose this Bill. We say that it is unnecessary. It will probably be yet another contribution to causing greater problems in the broadcasting industry than those we have already had. We have enough problems already. Many of them-although not all of them-have come from decisions taken in this country since 1983. It is those decisions of the Government which in many cases have thrown this industry into turmoil and which, together with the Government's own economic problems, have caused very serious consequences for the broadcasting industry. It is thrown into turmoil, in part at least because of decisions of the Government. Here we have what we believe to be another one. There are a host of them and I do not want to go on at length about them tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole turmoil in FM radio is a depressing and disturbing monument to the Government's incapacity to get this issue straight and to have a proper, sensible, balanced and orderly introduction of FM radio in the cities and in regional areas. Secondly, we have had this idea floated around the place that the Broadcasting Tribunal may be abolished. At the same time, we have two Bills in the Senate at the moment, the Broadcasting Amendment Bills Nos 1 and 2, which are designed to improve, so it is said, the Broadcasting Tribunal. We have Bills in the Parliament designed to improve the Tribunal on the one hand, and on the other hand we have officials from departments and Ministers dropping hints all over the place that the Broadcasting Tribunal may be abolished. Is it any wonder that the industry is in turmoil when that is the prevailing sentiment and approach?</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we have the matter which will make the lives of Labor Party members of this House a misery-that is, the threat to take public broadcasting off the FM band. Government members know as well as I that many of these broadcasters are Labor Party sympathisers, certainly Labor Party voters. They will have Labor members' throats, if not other parts of their anatomy, before the next election and during it. They do not like these hints that after being given frequencies, after having to spend the money on equipment for FM broadcasting and after going through all their test broadcasts, now on the eve of going on the air they are told they will probably have to move off the FM band and on to AM. That is not really the sort of furphy which the Government should be encouraging to run if it is looking for support in the community and if it wants to have an orderly regular broadcasting system in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on all night-although you would like me to, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not-with other examples of this instability and disordered state of affairs with respect to the broadcasting industry. What we have tonight is one more instalment of it. It is a heavy-handed approach to solve a very limited problem indeed and one which I venture to say will cause more trouble and create more problems than it claims to solve. We are opposing the Bill for those reasons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least we can be very clear about the Opposition's position on the Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill. It has said it will be opposing it because it believes that the current loopholes in the Broadcasting Act should remain. It thinks that the legislation which governs ownership of television and radio should allow the possibility of greater foreign ownership. We all know that channels 7, 9 and 10 have been very keen to try to solve their own financial problems by selling parts of their shareholdings to overseas interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year the American television network, CBS and the American film studio, Paramount, were very keen to buy a part of the Nine network. The only reason that that did not proceed was that this Government made it very clear that it would not allow the current loopholes to stand because it believed that the existing limits-the spirit of the law, which put a limit of 15 per cent on single owners and a total foreign ownership limit of 20 per cent-should stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made it clear that it does not support that. If the Opposition wins the next election we can assume that it will remove these limits. It will allow CBS and Paramount to come back into the market and perhaps buy major shareholdings in 9, 7 and 10. </PARA>
<PARA> With the power of the yen some people might ask why Japanese television networks are not expressing an interest in buying parts of our Australian networks. The answer is that Japanese networks produce Japanese programs which are in Japanese. A Japanese company owning an Australian television station cannot have an outlet for the Japanese programs. This will continue until the day the Japanese invent something that converts the Japanese language into an Australian accent. Then, of course, we will have the Japanese broadcasting companies queuing up to buy a part of Australian television stations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your protection. This legislation deals with the limits which this Parliament wishes to place on foreign ownership of the Australian television industry. It is quite in order for me to express my views as to what those limits should be, whether it is for a broadcasting company in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom or anywhere else. The simple point is that whether foreign owners come from United States or any other country they will be very keen to buy a part of our industry if we allow them to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some people might say, `What does it matter if CBS or Paramount or some other American company owns a part of our television networks?'. The reason it matters is that it will then use the Australian market as a dumping ground for its programs. If CBS has the largest shareholding in the Nine Network, will Channel Nine be allowed to buy programs off NBC or ABC in the United States? Will Channel Nine be squeezed by that dominant shareholder if it tries to buy programs off the BBC or ITV in the United Kingdom? Of course, CBS as the dominant shareholder will ensure that its client television company buys the programs that it wants to sell-that is, CBS programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite might not be concerned that the Australian television networks could become the dumping ground for a shareholder such as CBS. But I am concerned about it, and I am very proud that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and this Government have taken a very tough stand to make sure that we maintain our cultural identity as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> We are all very proud of the achievements of the Australian film industry. Prior to the 1970s, the Australian film industry was dead. When we went to the movies we saw American films made in Hollywood, and the resurgence of the Australian film industry in the 1970s and 1980s meant that we were able to discover a part of ourselves. That is something which honourable members on the Opposition side should be very proud of, because a number of its Ministers in the Fraser Government made a contribution to the revival of the Australian film industry. It was not as great a contribution as that made by Labor Ministers, but they also made a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason it is important that we have a vibrant Australian film industry is that when we go to the movies we should be able to see ourselves reflected in what we see. But if films are important, how much more important is our television industry when we think of the amount of time that people spend at the movies compared with the amount of time they spend watching television? If we turn on the television in Australia, all we get are American programs-and that means that we do not get a proper reflection of ourselves and our culture in what we see on the news, in drama, comedy and sport. That is not healthy for our country. So what we see on television has to have a very high Australian content. </PARA>

The problem is that we can meet the minimum Australian content levels by, time after time, showing reruns of cheap Australian programs or music videos that might have been produced by small Australian producers to promote a rock band. Because the film videos were made in Australia, that counts as Australian content. So simply having an Australian content rule does not solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to make sure that the people controlling the Australian television networks have a commitment to making sure that they are investing money in Australian television production, whether in drama, comedy or other areas, especially current affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The comment of the honourable member for Menzies, who is the Opposition shadow Minister on this issue, that this Government is using a sledge-hammer to solve a simple problem is wrong. Yes, it could be said that we are using a sledge-hammer, but we are using a sledge-hammer to make sure that we have a very firm structure that will withstand the storms and pressures caused by those who wish to sell off part of the industry. This Government wants to make sure that we have very firm rules that ensure that those limits of 15 per cent and 20 per cent are not exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to go back over the history of this particular proposal. We have explained why it is important that there be limits. Both sides of the House agree that there should be limits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mitchell was not listening to what his shadow Minister said, because he said that the Opposition was not opposed to a limit of 15 per cent or 20 per cent; the Opposition was opposed to the Government's closing the loophole. Where did the loophole come from? It is very interesting to go back through this, because since 1951 there has been an upper limit of 20 per cent in the foreign ownership of Australian television stations. But in 1981 a series of amendments were introduced by the then Minister for Communications which allowed contrived schemes to permit foreign companies to own up to 50 per cent of holding companies and blocks of 15 per cent. That allowed people to get around the spirit of that legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a curious person, I was interested to learn who the Minister for Communications was at that time. When I looked up the excellent Australian Parliamentary Handbook to find out who the Minister for Communications was in the Fraser period, I discovered that Ian McCahon Sinclair was the Minister from 3 November 1980 to 7 May 1982. I note that he is in the House, and I think that he is the next speaker in this debate. The other Minister for Communications under the Fraser Government, of course, was the previous speaker, the honourable member for Menzies. So it is nice to know that these members are still as expert on these issues as they were in the Fraser years when the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) introduced the amendments which resulted in this loophole going into the statutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Why were those amendments introduced? We all know that it was because the Fraser Government had to change the definition of who could be allowed to own a licence from an Australian citizen to an Australian resident because Mr Murdoch wanted to obtain a few television licences in the United States, where the law is that one has to be a United States citizen. Nevertheless, in 1981 the law allowed these contrived schemes to get around the spirit of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the honourable member for Menzies made it clear that the Opposition still supports the spirit of those limits of 15 per cent and 20 per cent. The Opposition just does not believe that the Government should be closing the loophole. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I finish, I wish to make several final comments on statements that have been made by the Opposition's previous spokesman on this issue. In the Australian of 19 January, when this issue was before the public, there appeared a record of the comments made by the then Opposition spokesman on communications, Senator Richard Alston. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA>But the Opposition spokesman on communication, Senator Richard Alston, said retrospective action by the Government to disallow 50 per cent foreign ownership in a holding company would ``grandfather'' current arrangements for the Ten Network while acting as a torpedo to rescue operations for the Seven and Nine networks. </PARA>
<PARA>A press release from Senator Alston on 5 February this year said:</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the current arrangements have been in place for almost ten years without causing any difficulties and there has been absolutely no community or industry pressure for change. </PARA>
<PARA>So again we have the Opposition saying that it is quite happy for these loopholes to stay on the statute books to allow foreign organisations and companies to own up to 50 per cent of Australian television stations. But the best clip of all is the following statement which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 19 February this year under the headline `Libs back 50 pc limit for TV control':</PARA>
<PARA>A coalition government would allow foreigners to effectively own 50 per cent of Australian commercial television networks, the Opposition Leader, Mr Peacock, said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>A spokesman for Mr Peacock told the Herald: ``We don't intend to change the current law''. This purports to prohibit foreign ownership above 20 per cent, but has a loophole which officially allows 50 per cent, and which the Seven and Nine networks plan to exploit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition communications spokesman, Senator Richard Alston, said the coalition saw no need for a change, but that it would, if necessary, ``ensure there is no undue foreign influence in the licensee company''. </PARA>
<PARA>It is nice to know that the Opposition is consistent: it said before the last election that if it had won it would have allowed foreign companies and individuals to own up to 50 per cent of our television stations here in Australia and the Opposition, in the contribution made by the new shadow Minister, has made it clear that it will be consistent and oppose this Government's efforts to close the loophole and re-establish that limit of 15 per cent and 20 per cent for foreign ownership of Australian television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, I think it is important as Australians that we continue to make sure that Australians control our television industry and that Australians are making decisions as to how much money is put into drama, news and sport. The contribution from the Opposition compromises our efforts to try to make sure that this is carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, if one has seen a dog's breakfast, one has seen the Government's broadcasting and communications policy. I find it quite incredible that we have such a hotchpotch of introduced amendments which fit into no orderly pattern and which supposedly are designed to produce what seems to be an impossible trifecta: more choice; more Australian ownership; and better programming.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think anything illustrates more the farce of this term of the Hawke Government than the way in which immediately after the election, leaked to the media of Australia by the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), was that letter that suggested that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was to be the new boss who was going to implement micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the House remember that the key to that was the fact that there were to be a number of steps that the Minister for Transport and Communications was to implement, and he was to be seen as allowing the progress and processing of a series of changes that were to allow greater opportunity for there to be a truly, productive, competitive environment in that field for which temporarily he is Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to look at the Broadcasting (Foreign Ownership) Amendment Bill in relation to that letter of the Prime Minister because to my mind it meets none of the criteria. The fact that it is not a Bill to lay down progress for even the next two to three years is apparent because we already have amendments to this Bill. We have amendments in the other place that are looking at another aspect of broadcasting and telecommunications policy. There is no certainty, no progression, that lays down anything that would allow anybody out there in the community to know what on earth the policy of the Government is. </PARA>
<PARA> Really, what we have to understand, or anybody who is looking at this particular package should register, is that essentially it is a by-product of those absolutely catastrophic changes which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) really piloted through the Cabinet a little while ago. When I say a little while ago, it might be three to four years back. But the tragedy of those changes is that instead of allowing competition in the media, instead of preserving that third part of what the House will recall I described as a trifecta-that is, the quality of broadcasting, the programming for children's programs, Australian content, drama, music and the rest of it-what we really have now is a sector where we find that the Government developed a program which was supposed to allow competition but which allowed greater concentration of power in each of the media sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole problem of this legislation is that this is one of the by-products. Suddenly the Government has found, because it allowed this greater concentration of power, that particular problems have emerged in one of the television channels. This is not a piece of legislation that is designed, as I initially said, to embrace the broad ambit of communications policy. It is a typical piece of Labor Party expediency. It has been introduced simply to try to overcome what was seen by a number of members of the Labor Party as a change to the structure and ownership of a station which they felt might in some way mean that Alan Bond in particular was not going to be allowed to continue to hold and operate Channel 9.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think, Mr Deputy Speaker, he might be addressing his remarks to you, actually. It is nice to see him here. My colleague, who also was a member of this place, unfortunately, like most of us, wants to see and address the issues according to the way they are and not necessarily as the Government would wish them, and I know some of the complexities he has found. I mean, it is dashed difficult: if one is trying to preserve competitiveness and a decent sort of quality regional television station, as my former colleague is-he knows full well that one does not know whether one is Arthur or Martha with the Minister-one does not know where the Government is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government had a very good policy, which I must confess modestly that I introduced, which was designed to provide supplementary licensing, which would have given progressively choice to country viewers. But no, that was not good enough for the Labor Party; it wanted aggregation. Now we are told the Labor Party might even have to provide government help to allow the stations to fund aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA> Aggregation sounds great as a concept but the point about aggregation is that it runs quite contrary to what the Bill is all about. This Bill is all about government putting its heavy hand in and saying that one cannot have more than a certain percentage of foreign ownership in certain steps where the foreign ownership is related indirectly to the way by which that particular television licensee is funded. That is what this is all about-it is where one gets one's money from. </PARA>
<PARA> Goodness me, the people over there-the Government-ought to know that they have made Australia more dependent on foreign capital than any government before them. We are more in hock. We have all seen the escalation of our foreign debt, and that is what this is all about. It is not about choice, because the Government says it is persisting with aggregation in spite of the fact that it might have to dig into the taxpayers' pockets in order to fund it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not really worried about the viability of individual regional broadcasters. The Government is not really worried about what I see as a very critical area; we ought not to be looking just at ad hoc expediency; we should also be trying to lay down some forward programs. So where do we get to? This legislation is designed only to cater to or fiddle with a particular problem and to try to solve it for the moment. It has not solved it because we have already had successive amendments to try to put something correctly in place. </PARA>
<PARA> My own attitude to it is that one cannot trust something that is introduced simply to try to overcome a particular problem. I am very disappointed in the Minister-I am glad to see he has come into the House. He has this great reputation of knowing where he is going. Frankly, this bit of legislation shows that he does not know where he is going. He has had all these pressures on him and he said, `For goodness sake, I cannot let this happen. I am going to introduce this legislation so that there will be a limit on the percentage of overseas ownership and consequently we are going to be able in some nominal way to preserve Australian ownership'. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am worried about is a series of aspects of this field of legislation. The first is that I want to try to secure choice. I do not believe that some of the other aspects of the broadcasting and television and media legislation are allowing that choice. Let me give the House an example: one of the most idiotic things that the Government introduced was restrictions on transmedia ownership. I happen to come from the bush and the bush media was developed because we had a lot of country newspapers established by guys and girls-and some of those girls are absolutely magnificent. I have a Mrs Higginbotham in my area who, through her husband having died, has allowed to develop the whole of the NEN 9 network in northern New South Wales-the 2TM network; it has been a tremendous success. So both sexes have been very much involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am worried about is through the transmedia, that is cross-media, ownership restrictions, it is now an impossibility for somebody to hold more than a certain percentage of each of the several types of media in a particular broadcast area. If the Minister wants to look at policy, I say that we should not apply restrictions in the way he is doing in this Bill. Let us look at the thing fundamentally and see how we can get competition and preserve choice. </PARA>
<PARA> One way the Government could have got competition was by ensuring that those small media people who had started a local newspaper, invested funds in radio, then started off television, were allowed to continue to be involved in their several media outlets because those people were the only people who really were able to say to the media barons, `Look, I am sorry Channel 9 or Channel 7 or Channel 10, we do not like the programs that you are producing. We are going to switch channels'. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know in the reality of the media world in which we live that the only way in which one is going to get program contracts is by preserving at a national networking level access to media outlets across the world, in particular from the United States and, to a lesser degree, from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe and perhaps elsewhere around the world. We accept that those small transmedia or cross-media operators are able to be sufficiently independent and sufficiently viable to say, `I am sorry, we do not really like that Channel 9 program. We are going to switch to Channel 7'. </PARA>
<PARA> All that has now gone, so what we have is a greater dependence through this type of legislation on each separate networking arrangement right across Australia. The networking arrangements are running into enormous problems, although not peculiarly through the legislation inspired some years back by the Treasurer but as a by-product of it. I think we need to register that the by-product of those takeovers, and in particular the Channel 9 takeover by Alan Bond from Kerry Packer, led to far too great a value being placed on those individual television stations. This legislation is part of the wash-up of those companies having been taken over and then trying to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that the product of this legislation was the final nail in the Alan Bond coffin. I make no judgment as to whether that was good or bad, but I say to the Minister that he should not introduce legislation that leads to a particular conclusion in a takeover situation. One of the reasons I object to this Bill is that I believe the announcement by the Minister for Transport and Communications prior to the introduction of this legislation was a material factor in Alan Bond no longer being able to fund the continued operation of Channel 9. Some people might say that is a good thing, but that is not the point. I do not believe that a legislative intrusion or a statement by the Minister should have that effect, and I believe that in this case it did. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that worries me about the legislation is that I consider it is about time we understood some of the circumstances which led the former coalition Government to change the legislation to permit this so-called loophole. People need to remember that at the time that change took place Rupert Murdoch, who has been referred to before regarding this legislation, had held a television licence, and of course published newspapers and had interests in radio stations, for a considerable period of time. When he changed his nationality he was not the only person holding American citizenship and a television licence. There were two others, but I do not wish to identify them. We would have been on the one hand allowing people other than Rupert Murdoch to continue to grandfather, as it is termed legally, the continued incumbency of a television licence, but saying on the other hand that because Rupert Murdoch decided to change his nationality he should no longer be allowed to be the holder of a television licence. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other American citizens-one is still fairly prominent in the television world-who continued to hold television licences. There has been no complaint about that because that is the grandfathering. Rupert Murdoch has made a tremendous contribution to the media. I may not like a lot of the things he does, and I have disliked intensely his political preferences over a few elections, but I think Rupert Murdoch is a pretty great Australian, albeit that he has changed his citizenship. Is the Government saying that because Rupert Murdoch is a continuing television licensee who changed his nationality he is to be excluded from holding a licence, whereas others who are American nationals-and the Minister knows one in particular in his own State-are able to hold a television licence?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us be realistic. The purpose of that amendment was not to accommodate specifically Rupert Murdoch but to ensure that an injustice was not done to somebody who would have been seen as being disentitled to a licence, even though he had continued to hold it for a significant period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern I have about this legislation is that it is another example of Labor trying to change the whole world without knowing where the hell it is going. We can tell it where it is going, and it would be better if it got off. Labor should stop the ad hockery, it should stop trying to produce immediate solutions that are not solutions, it should stop trying to impose disciplines that are going to interrupt the normal market forces in media ownership. It has to adopt more flexible arrangements so that my colleague in the gallery can continue to broadcast and provide excellent programs for regional viewers in Victoria, in the Mallee electorate, and in Tasmania. It should try to ensure that we have competition and choice in the media and that we have that third arm of the trifecta, that is, selective programming relating to children's programs, music, drama and Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill falls down because it does none of those things. It is ad hockery in the extreme. The Bill essentially introduces a temporary solution to patch up a problem, but before it has gone through the House it has to be repaired by amendments, with the introduction of another piece of legislation. There are flaws in the whole thing because the Bill does not address realistically the fact that there should be provision in some circumstances for financiers with some overseas involvement to continue to have an investment in such a company. The whole thing is a farce. This sort of legislation cannot be accepted in the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish the Minister well in trying to meet the challenge he has been given. If we had the Treasurer as Prime Minister it would be an absolute disaster; if we had the Minister as Prime Minister it would be just a mere disaster. It is only a matter of degree. I want to make sure that we do not just have competition between the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Communications. What we want is a decent television and broadcasting policy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time we had something simplistic, something understandable, something comprehensible, so that we could provide a service to viewers and listeners around Australia. I put forward that we as a House should suggest to the Minister that he go back to the drawing board and return with a piece of legislation that tells us where he is going. Let us have choice. Let us not have legislation that artificially preserves choice. We have a fiddle in the amendment we are yet to consider that has gone to the Senate. It appears to me that yet again the Minister is trying to accommodate a particular situation. Let us have a 10-year program, not something that is there for three minutes. I prefer to see something of substance so that we know where we are going, so that we get the idea that there will be choice and the maximum opportunity for Australian involvement, and so that we get the sort of programming we want. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back and look at the changes the Treasurer piloted through the Parliament, which I think have been an absolute disaster in terms of maintenance of genuine Australian ownership and Australian control and operation of the media. This Bill does not do that. It is like making a chalk mark on the wall. It rains and the chalk mark is washed away. The Government cannot remember where the chalk mark was last time so it lowers it and then raises it, and we end up with a dog's breakfast. </PARA>
<PARA> That does not seem to me to be particularly palatable. It is not palatable to the viewers of Australia. It is not palatable to those who interpret the law of Australia. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) is far too legalistic a body that does not understand the real world. The Government keeps on making the law more complex for it. It should get a few more practical people on it. We had a Mr Archer on the Tribunal a few years ago who knew what broadcasting was all about. Not a soul on the ABT now knows what broadcasting is about; they are all legal boffins. We should get somebody who does not live only in the world in which I once used to practise but knows a little about the industry and its problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get rid of that cross-media ownership restraint. Let us look at the changes that are introduced. Perhaps a few other things need to be altered. This Bill is not the answer. This House is not going to accept that this Bill will make things better. We want choice; we want better programs; we want to see progress in the industry. It has gone backwards since this lot have been here. I think it would have been a jolly good thing if we could have had a decent, comprehensive Bill. We might have got somewhere. This will not get us anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Forget the challenge the Treasurer might have for the Minister for Transport and Communications. Let us try to get a good piece of broadcasting and television legislation next time. This legislation should go back to the drawing board, and that is where I recommend we send it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members who have participated in the debate. The last speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), as one might expect, reminded me of the occasions-and they are odd occasions these days-when I get to a cricket match and have the opportunity to sit with somebody who opened the batting for Western Australia 25 years ago. Totally erroneously, such a person will believe that the opening partnerships then achieved by the Western Australian team were better and more stylishly done than contemporary partnerships. Nothing will sway them from their conviction that that is the case. The fact is that everybody else looking at the field cannot agree with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said in the past that one cannot take too much umbrage at the right honourable gentleman. He reminds me of one of those World War II cruisers seen in photographs coming in after the Battle of Leyte Gulf-all the guns are rolling over the sides, there are holes on the decks, one of the stacks has fallen over the side, but the cruiser is still going. I suppose the miraculous thing in politics in this country is that the right honourable gentleman is the living embodiment of the fact that a politician's life or political career is never over until he is carried out by his bootstraps. Given that the right honourable member is one of the ornaments in the House, I cannot take umbrage at any of the things he had to say in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do, however, take umbrage at some of the things the Opposition spokesman on communications matters, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), had to say, and I will get to it. I agree with him on one thing. In the first 15 minutes of his peroration he provided a perfectly accurate description of what the Government's amendments are about; so irrespective of whether any other members of the Opposition are confused by them, he clearly is not. He fully understands exactly what is meant by the Government's propositions and how the enforcement of those propositions will be made possible by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with the tracing provisions that are incorporated in the Act. So I cannot obviously disagree with anything he has had to say about that. It was all perfectly accurate, even if the conclusions that he ultimately drew from that were not. </PARA>
<PARA> I also cannot disagree with the contributions that said that we have in the Broadcasting Act something that is far too complex, that it operates within a framework which requires constant amendment because it poses constant possibilities, many of which are as often honoured in the breach as they are in the observance, and we create an appallingly litigious situation before a tribunal which ought perhaps to be more about standards than legalism. I do not think I could disagree with those comments at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Because we on this side of the House share that view, we have now under way in the Department of Transport and Communications a comprehensive review of the broadcasting legislation. It is my intention next year to bring forward a substantial amendment to the Act. The processes that will be changed by those amendments will, it is hoped, overcome many of the problems that have been referred to here tonight. I would not try to maintain-I do not think I have ever tried to maintain-that we have moved over the last few months various amendments to the Act in the belief that this is the only way the Act ought to be dealt with; far from it. They are of necessity the way the Act must be dealt with now. We are no different from any other government as far as that is concerned. If there is one Act that has been amended by successive governments over the years almost as much as the taxation Act it is the Broadcasting Act. There would very rarely have been an occasion during the course of a year when any government for the last 30 or 40 years has not been in this House with suggestions for amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act is inordinately complex and one could not say with any great confidence that even after one has conducted wholesale reform of it one is necessarily going to obviate the need for further amendments in the future. That is not the nature of politics, nor is it the nature of a system which over the years has encouraged extremely high priced help to be built up around the broadcasting community and has encouraged its various legal servants to find opportunities to exploit holes in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason why we take it all so seriously actually gets to the heart of what the proposition is today. We all acknowledge that there is something quite distinctive about broadcasting in its contribution to our society and the way in which it shapes and defines our society. Successive governments over the years have considered that to be the case, as was pointed out by the Opposition spokesman. What essentially is being introduced is a set of legislative propositions similar to those introduced by honourable members opposite when in government, albeit with better tracing provisions. Such propositions governed for a very long period the way in which the Opposition considered it appropriate that the foreign ownership rules should be defined in broadcasting Acts that it administered. We are not in fact doing anything different from that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition was not unique when it held those views. In those days the same propositions could be found in the British broadcasting Act and the relevant laws covering American broadcasting. Unlike the changes which occurred during the tenure of the right honourable member for New England as Minister for Communications, those changes remained in place. Those who find these particular propositions offensive ought to get on the phone to the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and the US Congress, Maggie Thatcher and most of the European countries and tell them to smarten up their act, that we have discovered a better way to protect our national culture in the broadcasting area and that they ought to learn from us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not proposing a particularly unusual set of rules. The level of foreign ownership varies in those countries that I have referred to. It is not 20 per cent in all those countries-that is the case in the United States; in Canada it is 25 per cent; in the United Kingdom also I understand it is 25 per cent-but it is about that level in all of them. Certainly nobody accepts the sorts of propositions that allowed, under an interpretation of the amendments that the right honourable member for New England introduced in 1981, over 50 per cent foreign ownership in the legislation that existed prior to the foreshadowing of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of foreign ownership, broadcasting is different from anything else in the Australian community. This is not a government paranoid about the issue of foreign ownership. We fully accept the view that foreign investment, including investment in equity and operations in Australia, is useful for a whole variety of reasons, including its ability to provide the capital necessary to exploit a particular technology or development and an addition to the sum total of human knowledge in this country by bringing into this country and developing within it products which might otherwise not have been developed. There are a raft of other reasons why foreign investment in this community is desirable. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has administered the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act with great flexibility in that regard. We would not dispute any of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the broadcasting industry is different. It does not stand in the Australian community, like other industries, by creating a set of conditions on which other industries depend. So it would be a reasonable government that particularly took the same approach in the micro-economic reform area to broadcasting that it might take elsewhere in the communications industry, in telecommunications or any other part of our services which have attracted government attention in the micro-economic reform area over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry is a stand-alone. It has a marginal impact on the rest of the economy, but it has an enormous impact on the way in which Australians think about themselves. It is also enormously sensitive to the predilections of those who control it. If those who control it are people who are of a totally different cultural, ideological or whatever background from the people of this country it is conceivable that what they undertake can make a very substantial difference. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why we got to a situation where the Australian film industry had to be revived in the 1960s and early 1970s was simply that that which developed in the 1930s was destroyed by the producers and distributors, particularly in the United States but also elsewhere, who saw it as competition for their own operations in the English-speaking world. That is all there is to it. There are those people with a similar interest in what happens here. The fact of the matter is that scarcely any Australian production makes a profit for the owners of Australian television licences. There is no doubt that they produce Australian shows partly because there is a demand from the Australian community for Australian productions. They produce them also because they are obliged to do so by other sections of the Act-the various rules that ensure Australian production that the Tribunal establishes. They produce Australian shows for those reasons, not because intrinsically the Australian production itself makes a profit. It is possible that the producers will make a profit if they are able to sell their products overseas, but the television station itself will be most unlikely to obtain that product at a price which allows it to make a profit from its transmission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a marginal dollar that operates in this critical area of our national culture in the broadcasting industry. There are very many ways of conforming to a 50 per cent provision which, nevertheless, do not produce inside this country a product which advances our own cultural understanding of ourselves, which portrays to our citizens the sort of nature we have and the sorts of values we hold. It is possible to bowdlerise any particular Australian production and to operate in a manner that ensures that that production is not of a nature that renders it competitive elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be a very foolish person who assumed that any production company or any distributor from any other country coming to invest here -and by and large these are the people interested in investing in Australian television channels-had as a primary objective a wish to encourage the development of an indigenous Australian television industry. Such people do not do it for that reason. They do it, firstly, to make money out of what ought to be a profitable enterprise; and, secondly and most importantly, to ensure distribution for their product in an important English-speaking market. Those are the primary objectives. This is not to regard them as the evil angels or as people who ought to be preceded by a red flag with an obligation on them to yell `Unclean' as they wander down the street. It is not to assume that at all. It is to recognise that they will act in their own interests and to ensure that we act in ours. In some areas, in order to obtain other benefits, we have to tolerate the fact that people would wish to use an opportunity to be in the Australian market and to own an Australian institution for their own good. In those circumstances it is probably also for ours as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In this broadcasting industry we do not need it. We need these stations to return to a pricing structure which can be afforded by Australian investors and would-be owners. In maintaining that possibility of foreign ownership, whereby people pay a premium for ownership of our television stations in order to expand an opportunity for their product, we ought not to permit a situation of weakness whereby, as a result of decisions taken by Australian owners of Australian television industries, we throw the entire show out with the bath water and effectively create a pricing structure that precludes any other Australian owners because we have insisted that the stations should change hands with the possibility of a substantial degree of foreign ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I completely reject the propositions that have been put forward by Opposition members and I am disappointed in them. I know that these days the Opposition rejects the fact that it has any association with Sir Robert Menzies. For many reasons I can see why it wants to do that, but I doubt whether the Opposition's reasons would be the same as ours. Hansard is replete with references made by Menzies in the broadcasting area to the importance of sustaining a substantial Australian position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labour Government in New Zealand has disappeared. It has been replaced by the conservatives. It is manifestly clear that while we have a fraternal feeling for our brethren in New Zealand, we have not chosen to go down certain paths that they have chosen over the last few years. Evidently, a few members of the Opposition want to follow them down those paths and we will assist them on their way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that we will, however, have our own views when it comes to the operation of this Act. Our view will be that there is a defensive posture required for our national culture in our broadcasting industry. It requires, with effective tracing provisions, the type of arrangements that have existed for the bulk of the period when the Broadcasting Act has been under the care and control of the Liberal Party when it was in government. We see no reason to move back from that point. </PARA>
<PARA> One or two other points were made that need to be cleared up. The honourable member for Menzies mentioned at one point that I made a speech somewhere saying that I was going to clear all the public radio stations off the FM band. That is a load of nonsense on his part. I agree that, had I said that, the consequences that he predicted would flow from such a statement would indeed flow. That is precisely one of the reasons why I did not say it, apart from the fact that I do not happen to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter, however, is that there is a requirement to get some money into the public broadcasters which is not possible for this Government in a period of financial stringency. By and large the public stations on the FM band occupy very small niches that are not suitable for commercial broadcasting. However, that is not so in all cases. Some public radio stations occupy a band that would be commercially exploitable. I have floated the idea with the public radio stations that they might like to consider that they vacate that band and use the funds that result from so doing to set up in the AM band. Because there would be a great surplus as a result of doing that, I have suggested that they might also use those funds elsewhere in the public broadcasting system to advance it. This would by no means remove the public broadcasters in totality from the FM band. It would certainly put one or two more on the AM band, but it also might make them even more viable than they are today. </PARA>
<PARA> That of course has nothing to do with this Bill. This Bill addresses the question of permitted levels of foreign ownership. It is multipronged in its effect. I agree that certain of the Bill's provisions are upheld by the standards that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal applies, but they reinforce those standards. In fact, this Bill, in its ownership and control provisions, effectively removes any possibility that our television stations can be owned or controlled by non-Australian interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill provides the general machinery for the implementation of the annual Premiers Conference outcome and of the provisions in the 1991 Budget towards Commonwealth payments to other levels of government. It comes at a time of renewed debate about the future direction of our Federal system in the wake of last week's Special Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important of all the issues discussed at that conference and the area of federalism that is in most urgent need of reform is that of Federal-State financial relations. For a long time now there has been a widespread acknowledgment that the current practice of federalism in Australia embodies all of the disadvantages but few of the benefits of a Federal system of government. We have all the inefficiencies and duplications that are generated by multiple levels of government and complicated tax sharing arrangements, but we have none of the benefits of the accountability and responsibility that should flow from having three distinct and competing levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the recognition that the founding fathers designed for a cooperative federalism has been corrupted by both State and Federal governments and has, so far, not been matched by appropriate reform measures. For too long we have been afflicted by a centralised and conflict-ridden model of Federal-State relations. This has resulted in a massive duplication and overlap in the functions carried out by the Commonwealth and the States and has saddled us with a burgeoning public sector at all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Until now, there has been little willingness for the parties concerned to address this unsatisfactory state of affairs. For the most part, they have been content to watch matters get worse for reasons of perceived political expediency. Presently, we are fortunate in that responsible economic management might yet be seen as something that will deliver political rewards from an electorate that has come to expect better from government at all levels. It was this sentiment which formed the Brisbane conference. Federal-State relations present a myriad of problems, problems with which the Special Premiers Conference has only just started to grapple. There is much to be done in the areas of regulation, interstate transport, infrastructure, the duplication of services and the like. The principal culprit in all the problems that afflict Federal-State relations has been fiscal centralisation. States grants Bills are the traditional mechanism by which the Commonwealth effects this centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the recent rhetoric of the Government and its belated interest in federalism, this Bill turns out to be no exception to its past practices. Australia has the most centralised system of revenue raising of any Federal system in the world. The $13.5 billion to be dispensed by the Commonwealth to State and local governments under this legislation is more than adequate testimony to that. The historical trend towards fiscal centralisation has been particularly pronounced under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the 1990 Premiers Conference outcome and the 1990-91 Budget, the Commonwealth accounts for only 50 per cent of total public sector outlays and yet collects 71 per cent of all revenue. The States and local government will be responsible for 50 per cent of outlays and yet they collect only 29 per cent of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between expenditure and revenue on the part of the States is, of course, largely made up of the intergovernmental grants, such as those provided for in this Bill. These grants have increasingly been used by the Commonwealth to impose its will on the other levels of government and to patronise favoured State governments. The current Government has used these grants to shift the burden of fiscal restraint onto the States to make up for its own lack of fiscal restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's Premiers Conference provided for a real 1.5 per cent increase in total Commonwealth payments to the States. This compares with a 5.4 per cent increase in the Commonwealth's own purpose outlays in 1990-91. The $400m reduction in general revenue assistance to the States from the Forward Estimates was the principal contribution to the Treasurer's much vaunted increase in the Budget surplus projection to $8.1 billion this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Government has pledged to maintain general revenue assistance in real terms until 1993-94, this commitment is conditional on the maintenance of a favourable economic climate. I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will agree that this is not something which this Government is particularly adept at guaranteeing or achieving. I am sure that honourable members will all agree with that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZI4">Mr ROCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am saying that the Government cannot be relied on in its Budget Estimates to achieve the outcomes that the honourable member suggests; not being capable of doing that, it then gives this hollow pledge to maintain general revenue assistance in real terms until 1993-94. It is simply another con. The last funding guarantee the Commonwealth made to the States was in 1985-86, a pledge that was reneged on after one year, something which played havoc with the States' forward planning. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has obviously forgotten, if he ever knew that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has also increasingly tied grants to the States to its own purposes through increases in specific purpose payments at the expense of general revenue assistance grants. General revenue assistance to the States now accounts for only 50 per cent of net Commonwealth payments to the States compared with about 70 per cent under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the States have not been blameless in this process of fiscal centralisation. The States have continually shirked responsibility for raising their own tax revenue regardless of their otherwise legitimate protestations about the inadequacy of the tax base on which they are forced to rely. This has occurred despite the existence, until its repeal early last year by the present Government, of legislation which would allow them to levy income taxes or even to grant income tax rebates to their citizens. The repeal of the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act, however, came just as the Greiner Government in New South Wales was giving serious thought to an income tax rebate under its provisions for the taxpayers of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of the degree of culpability on the part of the States in this matter, there was no excuse for the Commonwealth repealing the principal piece of legislation which would allow the States to assume the taxing responsibilities originally intended for them by the drafters of our Constitution. There has been no more ridiculous contribution to the debate about Federal-State relations than the obfuscatory nonsense of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about double taxation, which we heard from him early last year in the debate to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA> While the States have undoubtedly enjoyed being absolved of the need for raising significant amounts of tax, this luxury has been achieved only at the expense of fiscal responsibility. The Labor States in particular are now notorious for their fiscal irresponsibility. The States are now paying for past indulgences. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Victorian Government. If we hear correctly, perhaps there are some skeletons in the closet in South Australia also. The Commonwealth has had little choice but to impose some sort of restraint on the States from the centre. The coalition acknowledges that. We need a Budget surplus and a public sector borrowing requirement aimed at stabilising external debt above most other economic objectives. However, the Government should have coupled this with the imposition of at least as much restraint on its own activities. Only then can the Federal Government be said to be in the business of setting an example to the other levels of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever the case, the Government's actions towards States grants continue to impose a very crude form of restraint on the States. That is a poor substitute for actually making the States responsible for raising more of their own revenue. It does not alter the fact that the Commonwealth and the States have effectively formed a tax cartel which enables them to levy a more or less uniform level of taxation across the country. Since there is no escaping the taxes of the Commonwealth, there is no competition between the States in terms of offering their residents lower taxes and better value for their tax dollars in terms of government goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> So-called fiscal illusion has set in whereby taxpayers have become oblivious to the true cost of the services they demand from the various levels of government. The possible effects of fiscal competition are amply illustrated, if illustration was needed, by the abolition of death duties in Queensland in 1977, which resulted in a considerable migration of retirees to that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, whereas a working Federal system could act as a check on the growth of the public sector, our Federal system has instead served to promote it. Our system of intergovernmental grants must take the blame for this state of affairs. It is not surprising, therefore, that payments to other levels of government are now the second largest item in the Federal Budget. As Professor Ken Wiltshire noted in his paper on cooperative federalism for the Economic Planning Advisory Council:</PARA>
<PARA>Federal financial arrangements are the single most significant obstacle to a shake-out of intergovernmental duplication. The dominance of the Commonwealth Government in the taxation arena is in many ways the driving force behind its large scale involvement . . . in areas of government activity formerly considered the constitutional preserve of the State and local governments.</PARA>
<PARA>The present Government is also guilty of unequal treatment of the States. This year we have witnessed special payments to favoured Labor States under the guise of advances to the Minister for Finance as well as the special treatment of Victoria's borrowing activities-hardly the stuff of which cooperative federalism is made. Current Federal-State financial relations are also recognised as standing in the way of some micro-economic reform. The relativities determined by the Grants Commission, while designed to compensate States with relative revenue disabilities, may in fact encourage the States to maintain many of their inefficient public sector services and trading enterprises at the expense of moves towards privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week's Special Premiers Conference was a welcome initiative and a useful beginning in redressing some problems with our Federal system. The most important aspect of the Conference, particularly from the point of view of this Bill, was the projected joint review of Commonwealth-State financial arrangements by a committee, albeit a committee of so-called senior expert officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental reform of federalism in this country can only flow from reform of Federal-State financial relations, although one would have preferred that this matter were addressed by the elected government of the day or an independent inquiry rather than a group of bureaucrats already heavily involved in the present system. It was also disappointing that the terms of reference for this review should be so unduly restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unclear to the coalition what the Government has to fear from a more wide-ranging review, although clearly the Treasurer is nervous about any proposals having a bearing on his control of the purse strings. The Government has already indicated that it will not allow fiscal decentralisation to occur at the expense of the responsible conduct of fiscal policy. This is a sentiment that the coalition would and does endorse but, as we have seen, the current distribution of fiscal powers is already subverting any attempt to run a responsible public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> The States can be trusted to exercise fiscal restraint as long as they can be held responsible to their electorates for raising the necessary revenue. The sharing of such responsibility is an effective way to ensure that public sector spending and taxing is consistent with national economic priorities since all Australians are united in wanting to see overall reductions in public sector activity. Fiscal competition between the States has the potential to dramatically lower taxes in a way that the Commonwealth has not been able to achieve under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the emphasis of the review is on the way in which the States are funded by the Commonwealth. These arrangements are clearly in need of reform and the changes to the proceedings of the Loan Council and the Premiers Conference are welcome. But the review should not take place at the expense of a fundamental examination of the distribution of tax powers between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting of State and Federal Liberal leaders in June this year committed the coalition to a review of the taxation sources available to the States, in addition to looking at reforms to the grants system to ensure stable and more broadly based systems of funding for State governments. This may well include giving the States access to a broader range of revenue sources. </PARA>
<PARA> The current range of taxes available to the States are clearly inadequate to their needs and highly distortional in their effects, particularly in the case of stamp duties and the like. To date, we have seen only one small step towards handing over greater responsibility for taxation to the States, in the form of the Debits Tax Termination Bill, which will be worth approximately $385m to the States, and which is to be debated later this week. Again, this is a move which the coalition will not oppose, but it is only a very small first step. </PARA>
<PARA> The commitment by the Commonwealth to reducing the level of tied grants is also a welcome step, particularly given the unprecedentedly high level of such grants under this Government. The States' proposal for reducing tied grants to 30 per cent of total funding by 1993-94 will bring this funding in line with the proportion that was current during the term of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be stressed that the Government's professed commitment to reduced reliance on tied grants is totally at variance with the actual provisions of this Bill which place further conditions on general purpose payments to the States. This is most obvious in the area of higher education funding, as I am sure my friend the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) will attest later in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the States are nominally responsible for our universities through the various university Acts, the Commonwealth exercises almost complete control over the higher education sector under this Government. The current debate about the direction of higher education has taken place almost exclusively at the national level, with virtually no discussion at the State level, simply because the Commonwealth controls the purse strings. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with the so-called unified national system (UNS), by which the universities are required to do the bidding of the Commonwealth Minister of the day, crushing academic freedom and diversity in the process. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 11 of this Bill requires the States to pay their proportion of unfunded higher education superannuation costs to the Commonwealth as a condition of receiving the grants provided for in this Bill. Clause 12 of this Bill puts in place the machinery to implement the Government's policy of coercing the States into maintaining compulsory student unionism under the proposed Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> States that legislate to protect the rights of their students not to be forced to join student unions by universities within their jurisdictions can expect their general purpose grants to be docked according to the amount the Commonwealth hands over to the universities for student union activities. How the Government would calculate the amount of taxpayers' money to which it thinks student unions are entitled were this provision ever to be invoked is anyone's guess. </PARA>

However, this should be done through the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act, rather than through payments for general purposes, as is intended in this proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Federal-State financial relations cannot be addressed in isolation from some fundamental questions about the role of government in this country. Federalism needs to have a goal and direction beyond allowing the Federal Government and State Premiers to appear statesmanlike. At the same time as we address the spending and taxing responsibilities of each level of government, it is imperative that we also address the proper extent and role of the public sector in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Federalism is not just about administrative arrangements between different levels of government. It is also a theory about how governments can be limited and made accountable by these arrangements, and we should address reform of Federal-State relations in this light. But this is an area in which the Government is actively seeking to suppress debate, most notably in its hysterical reaction to the suggestion that some welfare services might be privatised-something which is taken for granted in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains to be seen what becomes of the joint review of financial arrangements to which I have referred, and the extent of the Government's willingness to make real reforms in this area. Given that the committee will not present its final report until November next year, it may be some time before we see real progress in this vital area. We may have to wait for next year's two special premiers conferences before we see more substantial reform measures emerge from this Government, but that would be something to look forward to if we could confidently expect it. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition will not move a second reading stage amendment, but we want to point out that the States have borne the brunt of the Government's fiscal restraint rather than reductions in government own-purpose spending. The Commonwealth has increased its dominance over the States by tying an even greater proportion of funds which are paid to the States. Just as important, the Government has failed to consider the problems of vertical imbalance, despite paying lip service to a full review of Commonwealth-State relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will oppose clause 12 at the committee stage on the ground that it is inconsistent with the coalition's attitude towards compulsory unionism of any kind and compulsory student unionism in particular. If clause 12 is not deleted, we will oppose this Bill at the third reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA> This Bill deals not only with the implications of financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, but in particular capital expenditure by the States, the contribution by the States to costs of higher education, superannuation and other matters associated with higher education. However, it is to the area of Commonwealth-State financial relations, as highlighted in this Bill, that I wish to address my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The day after the Melbourne Cup I wish to spend a few minutes tonight talking about another cup-that is, the America's Cup. The impetus behind my remarks is an article published in last week's Bulletin magazine, dated 6 November 1990, which carried a cover story on the America's Cup, the next contest for which is scheduled to be sailed off San Diego, California, between the months of January and May 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article, entitled `Australia launches the people's challenge', was written by Bruce Stannard, a well known yachting writer. The article reports on the Spirit of Australia challenge which is headed by Iain Murray and his skipper Peter Gilmour. Stannard, whose opinion is to be respected on such matters-I say that from the perspective of being a former competitive yachtsman myself-writes in his article:</PARA>
<PARA> I have no crystal ball for San Diego in 1992 but have been around long enough to know an America's Cup winner when I see one and, in Spirit of Australia, I believe Murray and his design team are creating the lines of what may well be a world-beater. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with Bruce Stannard. In Iain Murray, who is the main thrust behind the Spirit of Australia syndicate, we have someone who possesses Ben Lexcen-like design genius and who has proven administrative and organisational ability. In Peter Gilmour, who comes from my home State of Western Australia, we have a world ranked match racing helmsman. In the crew we have a body of men who have vast America's Cup experience already and collectively five years racing experience together as a crew. </PARA>
<PARA> The syndicate has been advantaged by having design data generously handed over by Alan Bond. Already the new emerging data from current computer design and tank testing is very promising indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we add all of those elements together the problem remains one of hard cash. Overseas syndicates-and there is enormous challenger interest in this Cup-will be raising and spending between $30m and $50m each. It is a rule of thumb for their particular bids. In Australia at the moment and for the foreseeable future we have no Alan Bonds and no Kevin Parrys and it remains to be seen what will be the extent of wider commercial and corporate support. Recognising that, the Murray syndicate has struck a rock bottom budget of $10m. In terms of the magnitude of the cost of such a bid the hull alone will cost $4m. </PARA>
<PARA> To raise this money Murray and his syndicate have launched a public fund raising campaign for what it has described and what is described in the Bulletin article as `the people's challenge'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Australians spent $60.7m at the Totalisater Agency Board. Who is to know what we spent in the ring with the bookie or what we spent at the work social in terms of the sweep? A figure of $10m should not be beyond us to fund this magnificent contest for the America's Cup. I believe it is worthwhile. I believe it is not just a punt but an investment because the America's Cup is more than just a sporting event. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally saw-and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) perhaps saw it from more of a distance-the millions of dollars that was brought into Fremantle during the defence of the Cup in 1987. The people of San Diego are expecting 1.1 million people to visit the Cup site for the challenge and defence by the Americans and they expect an influx of over $1 billion to that particular region of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can back this challenge, if we can win the Cup and ultimately defend it off Sydney in 1995, it will bring similar amounts of much needed and much wanted foreign exchange into Australia. I raise this tonight because I support this challenge and I hope Australia will get behind the effort to win the Cup back. Donations can be sent, no matter how large or small, to the Darling Harbour Yacht Club, at Darling Harbour, Sydney. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NT4">Dr CATLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Adelaide)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.35)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the House on a matter of concern to me in relation to a company called Delen Corporation Pty Ltd and, in particular, the actions of this company which have brought hardships to its employees, some of whom are my constituents. Delen Corporation is a printed circuit board manufacturer which used to employ around 50 people in Adelaide. The parent company is situated in Sydney and it has another factory in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 11 July Roger Delen, the Managing Director, flew to Adelaide, called a meeting of his employees and told them that their attitude was not satisfactory. He announced that unless their attitude improved he would sack them. He then placed on the notice board this notice which he called a final warning:</PARA>
<PARA> This is to confirm my advice at a meeting this morning . . . that all OPERATORS, LEADING HANDS AND SUPERVISORS are notified that if their work attitude . . . does not improve they will be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that it is necessary to take this step, but there are still too many mistakes being made resulting in rejects which are costing the Company dearly . . . in customer dissatisfaction. The Company cannot continue to tolerate this ``She'll be right'' attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> Every individual employee now has the opportunity to prove themselves as a sincere, hard working member of our Team, and if they are not prepared to put in extra effort to achieve our goal . . . to make the Company successful there is no alternative but dismissal. </PARA>
<PARA>Three weeks later, Delen sacked a third of his workers, alleging poor performance. This was and still is disputed by the employees and supervisors including some of the managers. </PARA>
<PARA> The workers who are members of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia then sought assistance from the union. Mr John Genovese, the Adelaide branch Assistant Secretary, spoke with the Managing Director, Mr Delen, in the hope that he could resolve the problem. He was told that he, Mr Genovese, had no interest in the factory or in its operation and, as far as he, the Managing Director, was concerned, it was a non-union factory. Mr Genovese correctly pointed out that under the award he did have legitimate reasons for his visit to the factory and that in fact quite a few of the employees were members of the union. As a result of this visit, the final notice, which was still on display, was removed. Delen then took his venom out on the Administration Manager for allowing a union official on the premises. As a result, she has suffered stress and a stroke since Delen advised her of the union's visit and her handling of it. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 August, Delen went back to Adelaide and, with no notice, sacked the remainder of his workers, including managers, effectively closing the factory. He paid all his employees just one week's termination pay. Some of these people had 17 years service with the company. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of concerns relating to this masterpiece of personnel management. I also draw the attention of honourable members to the mode of financial operation of the company. Delen Corporation bought the South Australian operation about two years ago and then transferred most of its work to the Sydney operation. Orders were taken in Sydney but some of the work was then done in Adelaide. On completion, the product was transferred back to the Sydney plant. From there, it was invoiced to customers. This meant that the Adelaide factory was working flat out but not receiving money for all the work it did since it was invoiced to the Sydney head office. From that kind of operation is it any wonder that the books for the Adelaide factory indicated that it was operating at a loss?</PARA>
<PARA> The union has taken legal action with respect to money still owing to sacked employees and has obtained an order in the South Australian Industrial Commission for Delen to pay over $111,000 which is still owed. It is still pursuing action with respect to unfair dismissal. I have a number of clippings from the local media on this subject which go much along the lines I have just described. But the company has refused to comment on the stories that have regularly appeared. </PARA>
<PARA> This company deserves investigation and its employees in Sydney and Melbourne should be warned of the consequences of working for such an employer. It is just this sort of operation that unfortunately gets assistance, from the State government in this case, of $2m. It then closed down the plant when it suited it financially, as if it were a throwaway branch office. It will not do. It is not a viable way to build a competitive computer industry that can compete on the world market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One runs the risk of misrepresentation when raising issues of a sensitive political nature like poverty and the difficulties experienced by sole parent families and the unemployed. This is particularly so in times of extreme social and economic pressures when the cycle of poverty becomes self-perpetuating and brings forth statements of concern like those expressed by Archbishop Hollingworth which sting Prime Ministers and Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember well raising the plight of the unemployed in the House some years ago and being accused of prejudice and, by one commentator, of being a fascist. Strong stuff, particularly as the suggestions made then have now been introduced by this Government in the last Budget! Time and circumstances are powerful instruments of change rather than ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> The response to my question on 17 October by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) regarding the escalating increase in sole parent families was predictable and good theatre, but will do nothing to address the appalling socioeconomic problems that many parents and their children are experiencing. The impact on these families will become a permanent feature of Australian society unless we change direction. This Parliament must acknowledge that the recent statistics are appalling and clearly indicate that a new industry of poverty is being created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister accuses me of not sticking to the facts. Let us look again at those figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and published in the Age. Last year there were 50,788 births outside marriage, and this represented 20 per cent of all babies born, and of the 14,153 births to teenagers 78 per cent were to unmarried mothers. In 1973-74, when the supporting parents scheme was introduced, there were 84,158 recipients of benefits totalling $142.4m. Today, there are 250,500 recipients with a benefit outlay of $2.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Mallee the exodus of families from farms and towns during the 1983-84 crisis period left many houses vacant, creating a major demographic change. Retired people, many families and a significant number of sole parent families have fled the cities in search of affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA> As governments, particularly the State governments, withdraw or rationalise many community services, these families are experiencing extreme difficulties. The limiting of such services, compounded by a lack of public transport, is producing a new set of problems and many are unable to cope. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government is under pressure to develop new functions outside its normal charter and its financial capacity. Voluntary agencies are under stress as they endeavour to fill the gap left by Government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Social policies, surely, must be primarily directed towards meeting the immediate daily requirements of families, but with the ultimate aim of encouraging families back into the mainstream of society and not into a continuing welfare regime and self-perpetuating poverty. There is no suggestion that benefits be removed from deserted wives and husbands, widows or families with one parent. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that the Child Support Agency and the increase in non-custodial parents paying maintenance is a good initiative. However, every member of this House will know of the difficulty in getting many to register with the agency, the almost daily contact its officers have to make in order to pursue and maintain maintenance payments on behalf of constituents and the awful situation that many sole parents are confronted with on a daily basis to meet the basic requirements of family life. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, unlike the response from the Minister for Community Services and Health, which was an emotional outburst, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) have approached this issue in a more mature way. They have pointed to the real difficulties of the interaction between the pensions income test and the taxation system in developing policies to assist sole parents who seek to supplement their income and to the harsh treatment of those who seek to improve their situation by working. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot be content in our country of 17 million people with 500,000 children living in poverty and a quarter of a million sole parents and their families struggling to break out of a welfare regime. We have to change the system and encourage people back into the work force, into the mainstream of society and out of a welfare regime and a self-perpetuating poverty cycle. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Herbert)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.45)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the concerns of many parents of young children throughout Australia regarding certain aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. These concerns relate to two issues: firstly, whether the Holy See signed the Convention without specifying its reservations in regard to some of the articles; and, secondly, whether there is a clear existence of an area of conflict between article 5, which specifies in very general terms the rights of parents, and articles 12 to 16, which specify certain social and ideological rights of the child within the home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the first issue, I should like to inform the House that although the Holy See signed the Convention, at the same time it issued a statement on 20 November 1989 through Archbishop Renato Martino, the permanent observer of the Holy See at the United Nations. Briefly, the statement indicated the concerns of the Holy See on three major issues. Firstly, the Holy See would like to have had further defence of the life of the unborn child included in the Convention. Secondly, the Holy See preferred the age of 18 years rather than 15 years as the minimum age for recruitment into military service. Thirdly, the Holy See felt that more specific mention should have been made of the right of parents to provide for the religious and moral education of their children, which reiterates the second major concern of the parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, Archbishop Martino announced the Holy See's forthcoming signature in a statement to a meeting of the executive board of the United Nations Children's Fund on 17 April 1990. The Archbishop's statement covering the reservations which I have just mentioned was transmitted to Canberra on 20 April 1990 by the Australian United Nations mission in New York. </PARA>
<PARA> The major concern of the parents regarding parental rights relates specifically to the degree to which and at what point article 5 supervenes any one of the articles 12 to 16. This will inevitably be subject to arbitrary interpretation, depending on what bureaucratic agency is doing the interpreting. I therefore invite the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to give fresh consideration to some of the concerns that have been expressed by many parents of young children throughout Australia; to ensure that those concerns have no basis in fact; and to assure them that rights of the child will be protected in respect of the issues that I have raised this evening. </PARA>

He states that he had not sent this article to Canberra, as had been suggested to him, as he feared that his opinion would only end up in someone's rubbish bin.

<PARA> As Australians we demand:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Immediate and positive leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the State and Federal Governments admit and address the above-mentioned problems. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the Federal Government call an immediate national summit involving the trade unions, employers, employees and small business people for the purpose of addressing all the above-mentioned issues and appealing to all Australians for a resolution. We believe that if the failure of a Victorian Building Society warrants a full Government enquiry, then the imminent bankruptcy of this entire country requires immediate and drastic action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal and State Governments are not entirely to blame for the state of this country. All Australians must share the responsibility. The Governments are, however, completely to blame for their refusal to admit the magnitude of the problem and to take immediate and positive remedial action. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to recommend that my constituent, in his own interest, show his support for this cause and to ask the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to address this most important issue. So on behalf of my constituent, I ask the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to come into this House tonight, tomorrow, next week and tell us what they plan in the way of programs that will positively address the series of major problems that I have read out from the article supplied by my constituent and which I am sure that all of us in this place know are causing great concern in the community and causing great anguish, great heartache and great pain. It is time that this Government addressed these problems and told us what it believes it has for us in the way of solutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, tonight I wish to raise for the consideration of honourable members a matter which we often do not reflect on, the question of how the press serves its functions in our society. I do so against the background that we take it for granted generally that we have a free press but at the same time of course there are many constraints which surround those who report in the daily newspapers-considerations, for example, of defamation and various other legal requirements that restrain what can be printed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Most of those restraints I think we all accept but recently there was an incident which I believe should concern honourable members as it flowed from what could be, I think wrongly, perceived to be an attempt to influence the press in not publishing material that comes into its hands from leaked Government sources. The incident arose when a journalist on the Australian Financial Review reported a series of background papers and briefings which purported to reflect discussions that had occurred preceding the arrangements for the sale of the Pipeline Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the publication of those articles, the journalist, Ian Rogers from the Australian Financial Review, had his office visited by members of the Australian Federal Police and in the execution of a search warrant his files were examined. The search warrant that was produced alleged that Rogers himself was suspected of being an offender against the laws of the Commonwealth in a sense that he received leaked information and therefore published it and therefore became in a sense an accessory to the crime of an improper release of information from a confidential source within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty with that proposal is not that the Commonwealth police were investigating a leak of an official or some other person who would have had access to that material and who had wrongfully produced it to the journalist, because I think we would all accept that it is part of a fair system of administration that laws exist to ensure that officials do not breach the trust that is placed in them and that documents of a confidential nature should not be passed to the press. I draw no objection to the Commonwealth police investigating that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Where I think there is a matter of genuine concern reflecting on the propriety of how the police investigation proceeded which, I think, leads us to have some concern about the freedom of the press is that a journalist, under that principle, would be liable for prosecution for publishing material that came into his hands. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that is a very different proposition because journalists by their nature are, in a sense, seekers of information which comes from various sources and they publish it on the basis not of a decision as to whether or not there was a technical breach of the law or otherwise in its acquisition, but, rather, as to whether it is in the public interest. If it were the case that a journalist faced a fine, penalty of imprisonment or otherwise for publishing leaked information, then it would impose a very severe restraint on the freedom of the press and one which generally we would not accept. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that we collectively in this Parliament would not wish to see those shackles on the press, I think we need to reflect on the way in which the law has a secondary influence of actually criminalising that, and I suggest to honourable members that they look to an answer to a question on notice provided by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in relation to this issue where he says that the Commonwealth will still maintain the right to proceed to prosecution against journalists in appropriate instances. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that is a matter of some grave concern. I raise it in general terms because I think this House needs to look at it. In other societies such potential abuses of the press would be criticised. In our society I believe it does raise very important issues of principle, and I commend honourable members' attention to that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the matter of road funding allocations to provincial cities in Australia and, most particularly, to the city of Bendigo and its allocation for the year 1990-91. I refer to the savage cuts which have been made to the road funding made available from Federal and State governments to the city of Bendigo during that period. The funds allocated to the city of Bendigo amount to $986,000. In the category of arterial roads it is $809,000 and for local roads it is $177,000, which effectively represents a 21.29 per cent reduction compared with funds provided for the year 1989-90.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bendigo City Council is particularly concerned and believes that the Federal Government, after the promises that were made during the Federal election campaign in March this year, has in fact neglected provincial cities throughout Australia. It made extensive promises during the campaign of increased road funding and said that funds would be made available to provincial cities throughout Australia. This type of funding cut will exacerbate the problem of deteriorating arterial road networks and will do nothing to improve the transport of people and goods in a safe and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to recognise particularly that the responsibility for the financing of road construction and maintenance is a three-way partnership between Federal, State and local governments. Bendigo City Council has continued to play its part and has this year devoted $4.3m, or 36 per cent of its total rate revenue, to its road program. It is obviously doing its part and it now falls on the Federal and State governments to play their parts in providing an adequate level of funding for roads through that city. </PARA>
<PARA> The city has a need for an improved level of funding, particularly on the arterial road network. This has been well documented over recent years, but the Council has seen that the length of declared main road has been increased from 4.89 kilometres to 23.67 kilometres. No doubt this is in recognition of the importance of the city's arterial road network, and the Bendigo City Council is now faced with a reduction in the amount of road funds available to service that network. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Government maintains an even-handed policy towards the parties to the Arab-Israeli dispute. This policy allows us to impress upon all concerned-with equal voice-the need for a comprehensive and lasting peace based upon a negotiated settlement between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's policy towards the Middle East is based on two main premises:</PARA>
<PARA> - as a longstanding friend of Israel we are totally committed to Israel's right to exist within secure and recognised boundaries</PARA>
<PARA> - we also recognise the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, including their right, if they so choose, to independence and the possibility of their own independent state.</PARA>
<PARA> Our even-handed policy is aimed at Australia being heard with respect by Arab and Israeli Governments. This is a valuable, balanced position that ought to be preserved if the difficult business of advancing a peaceful settlement is to be continued.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Approximately 60 per cent of the total staff of around 800 persons engaged by the Farrow Corporation throughout Victoria were employed under the Federal Clerical Officers (Administrative Services) Interim Award 1987. Four staff were employed under the provisions of the Federal Carpenters and Joiners Award 1967. The remainder of the employees were mainly executive and middle management staff and, as such, were award free.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have been informed that those employees engaged under Federal awards were paid at the appropriate award rate for the classification of work undertaken by the staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Federal Clerical Officers (Administrative Services) Interim Award 1987 does not contain any provisions relating to the payment of commission for the sale of share certificates by staff employed by the Farrow Corporation. As the award is silent in relation to the selling of share certificates to the public, such activity is not contrary to the provisions of the award.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Will the Minister give an assurance that the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) is not resisting its obligations under the Archives Act 1983 in respect of material sought by Mr Geoffrey Slater, the author of a forthcoming book on ASIS.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has ASIS (a) failed to meet time limits under the Act in respect of research requests by Mr Slater, (b) provided misleading or incomplete answers to certain of Mr Slater's requests and (c) failed to develop proper archival management, storage and control methods to assist researchers like Mr Slater.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a claim by Mr Slater that a letter sent to him from Australian Archives, on behalf of ASIS, informed him that certain ASIS records had been destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Were ASIS records of interest to Mr Slater destroyed; if so, what was the nature of the records.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) What is the estimated total cost to the Commonwealth of dealing with requests for information about ASIS from Mr Slater and Mr Jack Waterford, taking into account expenditures by ASIS, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Finance, the Treasury, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and Australian Archives.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Did an appearance for one day on behalf of ASIS by a barrister, Mr Stephen Charles, QC, in a hearing concerning Mr Slater's requests for access to records under the Archives Act, result in legal fees being paid by the Commonwealth amounting to $28,000; if not, what sum was paid.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Why did ASIS argue through its legal representatives at the hearing referred to in part (6) that a number of documents sought by Mr Slater should not be released to him on the grounds that to do so would cause damage to Australia's defence, foreign affairs and national security, when the contents of those documents had already been published in the press.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Would ASIS be in a position to throw any light on the whereabouts of a 20 year old newspaper clipping file on the subject of ASIS which is apparently missing from the National Library of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Did ASIS remove the Casey diaries from the National Library of Australia and censor them, at considerable expense to the Commonwealth, after the diaries had been fully extracted by a number of historians and published in the press; if so, why did ASIS take this action.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3497" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NORTH SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr Blewett</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Of 29 research requests by Mr Slater referred to ASIS by Australian Archives, 23 were dealt with by ASIS within the time limits set by the Archives Act. I am advised that in 4 of these cases the Archives was unable to inform Mr Slater of decisions before the time limit had expired. In relation to the remaining 6 requests ASIS was unable to give Mr Slater a decision within the time limit. These six requests, involving 1970 individual documents, became the subject of an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which was lodged by Mr Slater shortly after the 90 day time limit expired and was heard in December 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No. In June 1988, Mr Slater requested internal reconsideration by a delegate of the Director-General of Archives of earlier decisions to deny him access to ASIS material covered by 10 of his requests on the grounds that ASIS answers had been incomplete or misleading. In nine cases, the delegate maintained the original decision; in the tenth, an additional portion of one file title and one additional subject heading were released and the remainder of the original decision upheld. Mr Slater was informed of his right to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of these decisions of the delegate.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. See (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My attention has been drawn to a letter of 6 February 1989 from the ACT Regional Director of Australian Archives advising Mr Slater that a Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet document which he sought had been destroyed. The document sought was not an ASIS document.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See 2 (a). No ASIS records covered by the 29 requests made by Mr Slater have been destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am advised that the information sought about the cost to the Commonwealth of dealing with requests to Australian Archives by Mr Slater for information about ASIS is not available because neither Archives nor Departments or agencies to which Archives refer such requests maintain records of the costs of handling individual applications under Section 40 of the Archives Act 1983. Australian Archives has advised that the cost to date to Archives of internal reconsideration of ASIS-related access requests by Mr Slater and of his ASIS-related applications to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was $11,541. Australian Archives also advise that they have no record of any Section 40 access applications from Mr Jack Waterford for information about ASIS.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. The sum paid to Mr Stephen Charles, QC, by Australian Archives was $25,342, being $20,310 for 10 days of preparation, conferences and appearances before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and $5,032 for travel and accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) In an Administrative Appeals Tribunal judgement No. A 86/155 of 8 April 1988, Deputy President Todd accepted and adopted the propositions put on behalf of Australian Archives that even if a fact is the subject of widespread media and public speculation, its official acknowledgment could cause damage to security and that the fact that the contents of a document are known to an applicant is not of itself sufficient to defeat a claim for exemption. On these and other grounds, the Tribunal found that reasonable grounds existed for the claims that documents sought by Mr Slater were exempt under Section 33 of the Archives Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No. I am advised by my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories that before transferring to the National Library of Australia the diaries which Lord Casey willed to that organisation, his family arranged that certain deletions would be made from two publicly available photocopies of the diaries to be lodged in the National Library and at Australian Archives. The deletions were made in 1984 to the National Library's photocopy of the diaries in accordance with rules for exempt Commonwealth records now incorporated in section 33 of the Archives Act 1983. No deletions were made at that time to the copy of the diaries held by the Archives, which were not released to the public. In 1989 it was discovered that certain of the authorised deletions had not been made in the National Library's photocopy of the diaries. These deletions were made by officers of the Australian Archives in October 1989. Deletions to Archives' photocopy were made at the same time. The original unexpurgated Casey diaries are in secure storage at the National Library of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current situation with respect to bilateral and multilateral aid to Vietnam is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom suspended their direct bilateral aid in 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> Denmark suspended its direct bilateral aid in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> None of these countries, nor the European Commission and the United States of America, currently provide direct bilateral aid to Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Sweden and Finland have continued to provide direct bilateral aid to Vietnam since 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, France and Vietnam signed an agreement on cooperation and since then, France has greatly increased its direct bilateral aid to Vietnam. Italy also agreed to provide bilateral assistance to Vietnam in 1989. Disbursements under this agreement have not yet been made.</PARA>
<PARA> Other countries which do not give direct bilateral aid have provided assistance to Vietnam by various other means. Japan provides emergency grant aid and limited technical assistance only to Vietnam. Belgium, the Netherlands and New Zealand have provided assistance in the form of student fellowships and university-to-university cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA> Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom are at various stages of considering the possibility of resuming direct bilateral aid in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Donors have generally continued to provide funding to multilateral agencies with programs in Vietnam, with the exceptions of Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) suspended its lending operations to Vietnam in 1985 following the accrual of arrears to the fund. The clearance of its arrears would allow a resumption of lending to Vietnam. This in turn would be expected to encourage assistance from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and private sources. The French Government, with Australian support, is looking to establish a multilateral fund to assist Vietnam to clear its arrears to the IMF, thereby re-establishing its eligibility for IMF assistance. Australia has pledged $A5 million in 1990/91 for a possible contribution to this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA> The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund have undertaken assessment missions to Vietnam in recent times, but no new loan proposals have yet been approved.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The resumption of direct bilateral aid by Australia to Vietnam cannot be considered in isolation to other elements of the Government's approach to the complex issue of Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a withdrawal of Vietnamese military troops from Cambodia. In the absence, however, of effective verification of that withdrawal, a long-standing Australian precondition for the resumption of direct bilateral aid to Vietnam cannot be judged to have been met.</PARA>
<PARA> Given the role Vietnam can still play in advancing a comprehensive settlement in Cambodia, a resumption of aid to Vietnam is also contingent on circumstances evolving in which a settlement of the Cambodian conflict is in place, or at least in prospect.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been working in recent months to facilitate a comprehensive settlement of the Cambodian conflict. The prospects for achieving that are now better than they have been at any other time.</PARA>
<PARA> Although Australia has not provided direct bilateral aid to Vietnam since 1979, the government has been and remains concerned to help meet the basic humanitarian needs of the Vietnamese people, primarily in the areas of health, agriculture and education.</PARA>
<PARA> Assistance is channelled through multilateral agencies and nongovernment organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has continued to provide emergency humanitarian and refugee assistance as well as food aid for Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, although the title of the Convention concerned is `Occupational Safety and Health'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not possible to provide a timetable for ratification of these Conventions. To date, full compliance has not been achieved in all Australian jurisdictions. Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for Labour classified these two Conventions as priority targets for ratification in October 1984, and as such, they have been considered annually by officials who have reported to Ministers on developments. Ministers for Labour are presently reviewing the arrangements governing the selection of ILO Conventions which might be given a priority consideration for ratification by Australia. A number of ILO Conventions, including No. 151 and No. 155, are being considered in that context. I consider ratification of appropriate ILO Conventions a serious and important matter for this Government and I am looking at ways in which ratification of these and other Conventions can be expedited.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In the period July to October 1975 the Premiers agreed to cooperate in an investigation on the standardisation of fire hose couplings. The investigation was initiated by the Commonwealth Fire Board and had the support of the Prime Minister. The objective of the investigation was to identify the preferred coupling for standardisation. Any progressive introduction was for individual Brigades to implement. No Commonwealth funding was provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth Fire Board is not aware of what progress may have been made with further extensions in the use of the Storz coupling since the answer to question No. 1566 (Hansard, 5 April 1989, page 1061).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. I understand that the Australian Assemblies of Fire Authorities decided at its 1979 Biennial Conference not to consider further the question of standardisation of hose couplings for Australian Brigades. The provision of fire services is a state responsibility and any further action on standardisation is a matter for States and their fire authorities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Exchange rates are influenced by a variety of factors. In the case of the Australian dollar, commodity prices are of particular importance (see, for example, Reserve Bank Discussion Paper No. 8908). Interest rates can also exert an influence, but this effect can be outweighed at times by other factors: over most of this year, until recently, the Australian dollar strengthened despite falls in domestic interest rates and even larger falls in the margins between interest rates in Australia and in several major overseas economies. It should also be noted that movements in interest rates may have different effects depending on the sources of these movements, particularly whether it reflects a policy change, international financial (or other) developments or a change in the expected rate of inflation. The full circumstances of any change in interest rates need to be considered in assessing its likely effects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 12 September 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the continued holding by the state of Israel of the motor yacht Casselardit, which is half-owned by Mr Barry James White, an Australian citizen, through his share holding in the Gazelle Shipping Company Pty Ltd incorporated in Cyprus, and valued by Mr White at $400000, after having been taken by force from his possession and control in August 1985;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the fact that the taking by force of the Casselardit and all upon it by Israeli naval vessels occurred in international waters while the motor yacht was sailing from Limasol in Cyprus to Sidon in Lebanon, and that the master of the ship, Mr White, his crewman and his eight passengers were taken to Israel and detained against their will; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the fact that Mr White was held in a prison in Haifa, Israel, for 20 days without charge and then expelled from Israel, along with his crewman, after being told that he would not be permitted to retake possession of the Casselardit.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Did the Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs advise the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv, about April 1986, that Mr White's eight passengers were terrorists.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the Minister able to give the present whereabouts of Mr White's eight passengers on the Casselardit, namely, Sami Albitar, Nafif Abdel Cassim, Mansour Fadi Houssien, Gamal Class, Ali Alioubi, Mohamed Ea Kaateeb, Mohamed Husin Ali and Alsharqawi Mohamed Abdelaziz.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is the Minister able to say whether any of Mr White's passengers on the Casselardit were (a) charged before a court with any crime, (b) convicted of any crime, (c) sentenced by any court for any crime and (d) subjected to a term of imprisonment or any other penalty; if so, will the Minister provide details in respect of each.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Will the Minister take steps to (a) negotiate with the Government of Israel for the release to Mr White of his motor yacht and (b) ascertain the whereabouts and the status of Mr White's passengers; if so, will the Minister advise (i) what steps are proposed to be taken and (ii) the results of those steps.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) I am aware that the yacht Casselardit was confiscated by the Government of Israel after Mr White was detained by the Israeli authorities on 25 August 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) I am aware that the Casselardit was intercepted by an Israeli naval vessel and escorted to Haifa where the passengers and crew were detained for questioning. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised the Casselardit was detained `in the Sidon area'.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) The information I have is that Mr White was detained under Section 125 of Israel's Security Act of 1977 and was subsequently permitted to leave, with his crewman, on 15 September 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In April 1986 the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv that the eight passengers had admitted, during questioning, to active membership of a terrorist organisation hostile to the State of Israel and would stand trial.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv has not been advised of the whereabouts of Mr White's passengers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv in May 1987 that charges were brought under the defence emergency regulations and the eight passengers had pleaded guilty. On 24 July 1986 all eight were found guilty by the Military Court at Lod of membership of a proscribed organisation. Five of the eight were also found guilty of participating in military training without permission. It was noted in the sentence that the eight accused were part of the Fatah organisation who were planning in the summer of 1985 to penetrate Israel from Lebanon and attack an Israeli bus in the area of Kiryat Shmona. The names of the accused were given as follows: Abdallah Zamal Mouzlah, Mounir Salim Jamil, Naif Salama A-Karim, Mached Haled Mastafa Elhatib, Machmoud Machmad Ataba, Riad Machmad Atia Samalut, Paddy Hassin Mantsour, Moustafa Mousa Yousef. Mached Haled Mastafa Elhatib was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, Riad Machmad Atia Samalut to eight and the remainder to five years' imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Representations have been made both by my predecessor and the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv and by my Department here in Canberra. I understand that Mr White made an application for legal aid so that he could pursue this matter via the legal process in Israel but no advice has been received from Mr White concerning the outcome of his efforts.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) As stated under (3) the Australian Embassy in Tel Aviv has not been advised of the whereabouts of Mr White's passengers and representations have not resulted in the release of the Casselardit. As noted under (5) (a) no advice has been received from Mr White about his pursuing the legal process in Israel.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 13 November 1989 Mr Greenwood submitted a report on the operations of the SIU to the Attorney-General's Department. My predecessor, Mr Lionel Bowen received the draft report on 23 November 1989. In itself, this is not the report required by the Act, which needs to have regard to matters other than SIU operations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department carried out the consultation required by section 21 of the War Crimes Act with the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of Legal Aid Administration (as it then was) and the Report was finalised and printed during the Parliamentary recess.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Parliament resumed on 8 May 1990. The Report was tabled in the Senate on 23 May and in the House of Representatives on 31 May 1990, both within the statutory requirement of 15 sitting days after its preparation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a), (b) By arrangement with the me and with my predecessor, Mr Greenwood's reports have taken the form of verbal briefings from time to time, since the commencement of the consultancy, and have been at best as frequent as every three months. On some occasions these briefings have been supplemented by written communications dated as follows:-</PARA>
<PARA> 16 October 1987; 19 January 1988; 15 March 1988; 2 June 1988; 18 July 1988; 26 October 1988; 24 February 1989; 5 June 1989; 10 August 1989; 24 August 1989; 12 October 1989; 13 November 1989; 14 November 1989; 5 April 1990; 30 May 1990; 7 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No. These reports were provided to me on a confidential basis having regard to the specific operational nature of the reports which include the identification of particular suspects under investigation and the progress of those investigations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The SIU advises that the reasons that the 311 investigative files were suspended are as set out below. It should be observed that in some instances particular investigative files were suspended for more than one particular reason. This explains why a tally of the suspensions recorded hereunder would exceed the number of 311.</PARA>
<PARA> 106 cases were suspended because: (a) the person named is, or is probably, deceased;</PARA>
<PARA> 22 cases were suspended because: (b) the person is, despite concentrated efforts, not able to be located in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> No cases were suspended because: (c) the person named is an Australian citizen permanently living abroad and extradition is not possible or appropriate;</PARA>
<PARA> 5 cases were suspended because: (d) the person named is permanently living abroad and is not an Australian citizen;</PARA>
<PARA> 4 cases were suspended because: (e) the person named is or is likely to be unfit to stand trial;</PARA>
<PARA> 148 cases were suspended because: (f) where only a name is supplied, there is no supporting information which offers an avenue of responsible enquiry;</PARA>
<PARA> 6 cases were suspended because: (g) as a result of investigation, the allegation is probably false;</PARA>
<PARA> 31 cases were suspended because: (h) the allegation is vague and imprecise and after preliminary investigation further enquiries are unlikely to lead to proof of the commission of an offence;</PARA>
<PARA> 10 cases were suspended because: (i) the possibly sustainable allegation against the person would not amount to an offence against the Act, or would not be of such a serious nature to justify further active investigation; and</PARA>
<PARA> No cases were suspended because: (j) there is no evidence that the person named ever came to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) A response to this question would involve disclosing operational details, confidential sources and operational methodology. Such disclosure would tend to prejudice ongoing investigations and established good relations with foreign governments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I am advised that at 2 October 10 cases (in addition to the Polyukhovich matter) are identified as warranting ongoing investigation. Two of these involve more than one possible defendant, 6 individuals in one case and 11 in the other. 32 individual allegations and a body of intelligence supplied by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre are still undergoing a process of assessment prior to decisions on whether full scale investigation is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA> In total, 683 individual investigative files had been opened by the SIU to 2 October 1990. 640 of these have been either suspended or subsumed into multiple investigations. 43 investigative files remain active.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) (a) I am advised that ten, or at the maximum, twelve, cases have been identified as ``the most likely to result in prosecutions''.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) It is not yet possible to provide a timetable for the laying of charges and the conduct of prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (ii) The cost of individual prosecutions are variable depending on the nature and extent of the evidence. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is unable to give a realistic estimate of the likely duration or cost of a particular prosecution. The estimated cost to the DPP of committal proceedings, based on the Polyukhovich case, is $1.9 million. Trial costs are estimated at $1.7 million. In relation to defence costs, Finance has provided $4.4 million in 1990-91, being $1.2 million for the Polyukhovich matter and $800,000 for each of four other matters.</PARA>

<PARA> (9) The services of the nine leading historians were retained separately from the 21 consultants referred to in the preceding question and answer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Unit made an approach to the nine leading historians for three reasons:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Firstly to seek their services if required as expert witnesses at any future prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) To seek any possible contribution that they may be able to make to the Unit's investigations. The general response was that they could not make any significant contribution. Only one historian, who did do some work for the Unit, was remunerated at the appropriate market rate for his country.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) At the time of the approach it was proposed that leading historians would conduct research in Soviet Archives on behalf of the Unit. This proposal did not eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA> As at 30 September 1990 the Unit has not entered into any contracts with the nine historians. A number of the historians have however already agreed to travel to Australia to give evidence as expert witnesses. These arrangements have been concluded by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>

<PARA> (12) In respect of the amount of $10,000 appearing under compensation on page 8, the following explanation is provided:</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of $10,000 relates to legal expense and is incorrectly recorded as compensation. The expenditure was in fact incurred by the Director of Public Prosecutions in seeking legal opinions from senior Counsel in relation to a number of SIU investigations which had been submitted to the DPP for consideration. The legal expenses were incorrectly charged to the SIU by officers of the Attorney-General's Department in Canberra. When the error had been discovered the accounts for the financial year in question had closed and the result is that the charge remained against the SIU.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs Kelly</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Halons, which are specialised fire protection chemicals, contain bromine. In the upper atmosphere bromine can accelerate the destruction of ozone by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Dr Joe Farman's concern is that scientists do not know enough about this enhancement mechanism and it may be that additional amounts of halons might cause ozone destruction beyond that which would be expected from current understanding.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1986, the base year of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Australia's imports of halons were 910 tonnes. No halons are manufactured in Australia. With the implementation of the Australian Strategy for Ozone Protection, imports have been virtually zero since the beginning of 1989.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Strategy, referred to in (2) above, calls for the complete elimination of halons over time, with exceptions for `essential uses' such as aircraft flight decks or military equipment. The amounts of halons taken out of service have been more than sufficient to supply these essential uses. The remainder is being stored pending the availability of suitable destruction facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. HFCs, which have zero ozone depletion potential, do have a minor greenhouse warming potential so are not suitable for widespread, voluminous release to the atmosphere. On present indications there is no indication of this occurring.</PARA>

<PARA> Has her Department developed proposals and entered into discussions with government business enterprises and other departments regarding remedial action, minimisation of environmental destruction and alternative procedures for the installation of utilities; if so, (a) will she provide details of instances of such proposals and discussions and (b) will these instances lead to suggested general procedures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs Kelly</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department's responsibilities in relation to remedial action, minimisation of environmental destruction and alternative procedures for the installation of utilities by government business enterprises and other government departments and authorities are governed principally by the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 (the Act) and its Administrative Procedures. This Act makes provision for protection of the environment in relation to projects and decisions of, or under the control of, the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The installation of utilities by State or Northern Territory departments or authorities does not usually require any involvement by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> In cases where a Commonwealth department or authority proposes to install utilities, and determines that its project is likely to affect the environment to a significant extent, the Administrative Procedures under the Act require that the project be referred to my Department. It will then be subject to environmental impact assessment addressing a range of issues. These could include remedial action, minimisation of environmental destruction, and alternative procedures for installation.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this assessment process, the States or the Northern Territory are consulted as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to part (a) of the honourable member's question, my Department has discussed with a number of Commonwealth government business enterprises, departments and authorities arrangements to assist them in meeting their responsibilities under the Act and the Administrative Procedures. These arrangements are being embodied in Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) between my Department and the bodies concerned. MOUs are in place with Telecom and Australia Post, and are under discussion with other government business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to part (b) of the honourable member's question, an important function of the MOUs is to transmit `Guidelines for Identification of Environmental Significance'. These guidelines were drawn up by my Department for the guidance of officers in Commonwealth departments and authorities, to help them determine whether a proposed project will affect the environment to a significant extent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) (i) The first round Access and Equity Plan for the Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio was published in August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The second round Access and Equity Plan for the Prime Minister and Cabinet Portfolio is scheduled for publication by June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Office of Multicultural Affairs (OMA) acts as a facilitator of consultation on Access and Equity issues between community organisations and Government Departments and agencies, including those that fall within the Prime Minister's portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> OMA has established a network of full-time Regional Co-ordinators in each capital city, except Canberra. Their principal role is consultation with community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> OMA also employs a network of Group Facilitators on a short-term contract basis as consultants to undertake `grass roots' consultation with groups of people whose first language is not English.</PARA>
<PARA> A major recent consultative opportunity arose in the first half of 1990, when OMA organised a series of Access and Equity Open Forums in all capital cities. The main objective was to provide an opportunity for community representatives to discuss progress on Access and Equity strategies with State Managers of Commonwealth Departments. Consideration is being given to holding another series after the release of second round plans.</PARA>
<PARA> The Advisory Council on Multicultural Affairs has provided a formal national consultative mechanism between Government and the community. Its members were appointed because of their individual expertise to advise on appropriate policies for a multicultural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other consultative arrangements within the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA> The Office of the Status of Women (OSW) provides Secretariat support to the National Women's Consultative Council, which consults women in the community and advises Government on matters of concern.</PARA>
<PARA> Of particular significance is OSW's participation in the Commonwealth/State Council on Non-English Speaking Background (NESB) Women's issues. Eight NESB community representatives are on the Council.</PARA>
<PARA> Other portfolio Agencies such as the Australian Science and Technology Council, Economic Planning Advisory Council and Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman also consult with community organisations on appropriate specific issues.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Through OMA, the portfolio endeavours to involve the widest possible community participation in its consultative arrangements on Access and Equity. For example, the Access and Equity Forums were attended by an extremely wide range of representatives of ethnic and mainstream community groups.</PARA>
<PARA> OMA also provides core funding to the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia (FECCA), a peak community organisation with which it consults on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Dr Judy Winternitz is currently the officer with major responsibility for Access and Equity. She is acting in the position of Senior Adviser, Access and Equity Section.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The RAAF Board of Inquiry into the accident involving Nomad A18-401, and the review of the proceedings of the Board by the convening authority (Air Commander Australia) and the Chief of the Air Staff, were completed on 29 August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Recent advice from the Coroner indicates that the Coronial Inquiry into the death of Flight Lieutenant Donovan will be held in February 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no legal relationship between the findings of a Board of Inquiry and a Coronial Inquiry. However, as a matter of policy, the RAAF provides Coroners with a copy of the Board of Inquiry proceedings if requested.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Board of Inquiry found that there were some deficiencies in the performance of personnel involved in the maintenance of the aircraft and in the engineering management of the introduction of the aircraft into service. However, the nature of the deficiencies, coupled with mitigating circumstances, led the Board to conclude that those deficiencies did not amount to negligence. The convening authority and the Chief of the Air Staff have concurred with that judgement and have accepted the Board's recommendation that disciplinary action was not justified.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There were some servicing deficiencies; however, these were not related to the causal factors involved in the failure of the tailplane structure.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No decision has been taken on the fitment of Mod 663 to ADF Nomad aircraft. Mod 663 is currently being evaluated by Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) and has not yet been released. When the ASTA evaluation is complete and the modification has been released, a decision will be taken regarding its fitment to ADF aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) ASTA, in conjunction with Aeronautical Research Laboratories (ARL), are currently conducting flight and ground trials as part of a fatigue analysis of the Nomad tailplane. This analysis should be complete by the end of October 1990. The results will facilitate a determination of whether any redesign of the Nomad tailplane is warranted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr Willis</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is contained in the following table, which indicates the percentage change in outlays by function and sub-function (in 1984-85 prices, deflated using the implicit price index for nonfarm GDP) for the two periods 1982-83 to 1990-91 and 1990-91 to 1993-94:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In interpreting the data, the honourable member's attention is drawn to two points:</PARA>
<PARA> - Most figures for the Budget and outyears do not include allowance for within-year increases in Commonwealth sector wages and salaries. Instead a provision is included in the Defence function and the sub-function titled `Contingency Reserve'; and</PARA>
<PARA> - In the Budget papers (and this table) aggregate data are deflated using the implicit price index for non-farm GDP as a broad indicator of general price and wage movements. However, programs have formal indexation arrangements that utilise deflators other than that for non-farm GDP. For example, pensions and benefits are formally indexed using the CPI. Caution should therefore be used in interpreting the trends.</PARA>
