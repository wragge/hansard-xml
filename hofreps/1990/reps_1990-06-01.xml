<PARA> That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent government business taking precedence of all other business for this sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>As I think I pointed out yesterday in answer to a question from the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), provided the numbers are here for it we will be following the normal course of action-or what has become the normal course of action-for these days of sittings when we are called back to deal with final matters dealt with by the Senate. On the first day, the Thursday, normal business is followed. On the second day we put forward the suggestion that we should follow the course that Government business takes precedence so that we can have the maximum degree of flexibility in dealing with material likely to be bounced between the two Houses. This has been the way it has been done in the past and the Government's suggestion is that it is the way it should be done today. </PARA>

<PARA> I will say once more for the benefit of the new members of this House and for people who might be listening in other parts of Australia that in 1990, if the Government follows the sitting pattern that has been published, this House will sit for fewer days than any other parliament in the past 50 years. It will be the second shortest sitting period since Federation. The only other occasion when Parliament sat for less time than is proposed on this occasion was, I think, in 1937. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this indicates the disregard the Government has for Parliament. If it could govern without this Parliament meeting this Government would govern without calling Parliament together, but it has to call Parliament together for Supply purposes and to get other legislation through. It is treating the Parliament with contempt and when a government treats Parliament with contempt it is, of course, treating the people with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Leader of the House to reassess the arrangements for what is termed the Budget session of Parliament with a view to adding at least two, and perhaps three, weeks to the period that the Government intends the House to sit. This will enable members on both sides of the House to properly scrutinise the legislation that comes before it. </PARA>
<PARA> My only other point at this moment is to say to the Leader of the House that he should reassess his arrangements in relation to these special sittings when it is necessary to bring the Parliament back for one or two days. Whenever Parliament meets the Government should take questions and allow time for matters of public importance-in other words, private members' business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to provide a Commonwealth Government guarantee on all borrowings raised by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) before 1 July 1992 and interest on those borrowings. The Government agreed to provide the guarantee as one of several measures concerning the reserve price scheme for wool. The Government's guarantee provides a firm backing to the Australian Wool Corporation and reduces the risk of the financial sector reneging on loan agreements with the AWC. It will also assist the AWC to obtain access to credit on more favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, members of this House will be aware that yesterday I directed the AWC that the minimum market indicator reserve price for 1990-91 will be set at no more than 700c per kilogram clean. The direction which I issued is unprecedented. It is therefore appropriate if I address the general circumstances prevailing in the wool industry in this second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision was not taken lightly. It was taken after an exhaustive process of consultation with members of the Board of the AWC, with industry and with those involved in the processing and export of wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in this place during the second reading debate on the wool tax Bills on 17 May, the wool industry is in a very serious situation. Demand has been very depressed over the past year and production has reached record levels. Prices have progressively moved down to the floor. Corporation purchases have been very high during the year and stocks have now reached record levels. The chilling fact is that forecasts made by the professional staff of the AWC point to a further massive build-up in stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been closely watching the increase in AWC stocks since last year. However, because of the risks of altering market behaviour I have made no public comment on this issue until just recently. Because of commercial hazard I have been meeting with both the Chairman of the AWC and the leaders of the wool industry behind closed doors since late last year. In those meetings I emphasised my concerns about the prevailing market situation and the likely impact of this on the Corporation's activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this place will be aware that late last year it was suggested that the Corporation would need an increase in the wool tax to a maximum rate of 15 per cent. More recently, it was obvious that 15 per cent would not be sufficient to fund the borrowing activities necessary to support a stockpile of unprecedented dimensions. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit that automatically providing an increase in the tax rate to 25 per cent caused me, and the Government, considerable concern. My concerns existed for a number of reasons: I was unconvinced that by tackling supply alone the industry would effectively manage the outlook into 1990-91; I was concerned that the international demand for wool would worsen in the 1991 year; I was apprehensive that this would result in additional borrowings by the Corporation and a level of stocks which could not be meaningful managed in just a few short years; I was dismayed at the prospect of a corporation with potential liquidity problems being required, in the not too distant future, to act drastically to clear an overhang of stocks; and I was concerned that growers were not fully informed about the risks associated with any of the options facing them. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 May I met with representatives from the AWC and the Wool Council of Australia (WCA). I advised them of the Government's concern. I next met with the AWC Board on 18 May. The purpose of the meeting was to hear presentations from the members of the Board and the Corporation's professional staff on their commercial, economic and market assessments. My main concern was that all measures should be considered, that is, the reserve price, the wool tax, borrowing requirements and appropriate marketing strategies. I required a complete package which would protect the future viability of the industry and the long term interests of growers. </PARA>
<PARA> At Roma, I conveyed a similar message to that which I had put to the Corporation earlier: namely, to carefully and scrupulously examine the AWC's preferred option-which was a 25 per cent tax, a $4 billion borrowing limit and a floor of 870c per kilo-and compare the risks of this with a different set of measures. I could not bring myself to accept the AWC's preferred option because the risks to the industry and the Government appeared to be too great. The risk goes beyond allowing the industry to bankrupt itself. In bankrupting itself, it breaks the backbone of Australia's farm sector. With an 870c floor, AWC figures pointed to stocks of four to five million bales in a year's time. Two years out, the prospect was a full season's wool in stock. If demand fell further, say by 5 per cent-which is not totally unlikely given the situation in China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and eastern Europe-the figures showed stocks at levels which would overhang the market into the late 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs of holding such stocks are enormous. Present stockholding costs are considered to be around $220 per bale per year. Most of this is taken in interest charges. The interest costs alone would amount to $720m per year on a stockpile of four million bales. If demand collapsed, then a stockpile of six million bales would be a real possibility. That is not a wool mountain; that is a wool mountain range. The interest costs of a stockpile of six million bales would be close to $1 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, these figures give us all cold comfort. These figures demonstrate that the returns to growers from holding massive stocks diminish at an extraordinary rate. These figures demonstrate that commercial returns to growers are not maximised with stocks at those levels. Given a 870c floor and given stocks of such dimension, the Corporation suggested that an upper borrowing limit of $4 billion would be required. This would occur even with a 25 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Such borrowings by a statutory authority would set a new precedent. They would act to increase pressure on domestic capital markets, increase our foreign debt and would result in interest rates remaining higher for a longer period than would otherwise be the case. Members of this House will know that AWC's borrowings are currently approved at an upper limit of $2.5 billion. Given this limit, it would be likely that the tax rate would rise beyond 25 per cent. If demand collapsed, then a tax rate of around 40 per cent would be a real possibility. The financial consequences for growers and the social costs to growers would be disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> It was apparent after Roma that the AWC's and the industry's rock solid preference was for the 870c floor. This position was reached despite the presentations of AWC professionals. I, therefore, arranged to meet with the AWC and the Wool Council on 25 May to discuss again a viable package of measures which would not jeopardise the industry's viability. At this meeting the AWC put forward a new proposal based on a series of marketing initiatives. It considered that borrowings could be contained under the $2.5 billion limit, but a 25 per cent wool tax would be required over an extended period. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked for this proposal to be thoroughly evaluated by my officials and the expert and professional staff of the Corporation. Here I must say that I regard with contempt the statements by various people in the wool industry about the professional competence of people serving the Government and the Wool Corporation. The staff are doing their job and providing advice to the people that have to take the decisions, and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> I also gave notice to the Corporation that I was considering issuing a direction regarding the floor price. However, I made it clear that I wanted to see the evaluations of the AWC's proposal before taking final decision. I advised the Corporation that I would be discussing the matter with Cabinet before any action was taken. While I welcomed the effort put into the AWC's proposal, it was clear to me that it did not overcome the high risk of the 870c floor and 25 per cent tax option. The proposal was based on sustained increases in trade clearances of wool at unprecedented levels. These exceeded the levels achieved between 1984-85 and 1987-88. Simply, it meant a larger increase in clearances in the next six years than had occurred over the 40 years before 1986-87. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a graph which illustrates this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The graph read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>[GRAPH NOT INCLUDED ON DATABASE, SEE HARD COPY PAGE 1035]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House should note that the projections illustrated here are according to the AWC option which assumes increased demand resulting from promotional activities. Trade clearances are defined as total sales through the auction system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this was a period of extremely rapid growth in demand, highlighted by the strong presence of China in the market. A marketing initiative does not, however, equate to firm orders. We could not afford to wait another year to see what prospects there were for increased sales. My main difficulty with the proposal was that it did not get to the heart of the industry's present problems. This simply relates to the basic economic forces of demand and supply. A price has been set at a level which has discouraged the consumption of wool in the face of competition with more price competitive substitute fibres. This has been particularly exacerbated by the foreign exchange problems of China and the USSR, two of our most important customers. </PARA>
<PARA> On the supply side, the price has encouraged an extraordinary increase in production. This increase has been boosted by an unusual run of good seasons. Shorn wool production has been at record levels in the past two years and these are likely to be exceeded again this year. The prospects of another record next year also look strong. At the current price levels, growers will simply not cut back wool production. The Australian Bureau of Statistics now tells us that we have five million more sheep than we previously thought. Our supply calculations have therefore been underestimated by five million sheep and the wool from five million sheep. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, in general, accepts that the 870c per kilogram floor was set at too ambitious a level. The increase in the floor since 1986-87 has been a massive 71 per cent. If the floor had been set at a level consistent with the long-term trend in wool prices then there would be no issue before us today. However, had the floor been maintained at 870c per kilogram speculation about a reduction would not have diminished-not this year, not the next year. Such speculation would have increased if the market deteriorated further. Under these circumstances there is no logic in arguing that a correcting adjustment should not be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I had emphasised to the industry that an adjustment had to be made this year. At this time next year, with vastly expanded stocks, the types of options available to us today would simply not be available. Growers would have needed to pay whatever tax was necessary to meet the stockholding costs. Alternatively, the AWC would have had to go further into debt. We would have been gambling with high risk stakes; namely, the viability of one of our most important industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern I had related to the reserve price scheme itself. In recent years the minimum reserve price changed from a means of managing large unexpected downturns in prices to a price support mechanism. This development guarantees that the correct price signals are not transmitted to producers. It also undercuts everything that the farm sector and the Government have been saying internationally on trade and agricultural reform. I also have concerns that the proposal for the AWC to hold a substantial level of stocks, as part of its marketing strategy, departs from the original intent of the scheme. The new proposal has connotations of an acquisition policy-a policy, I would add, rejected by the industry in the 1970s. Such major changes away from the original policy or legislative intent must be subject to open review and debate before being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition I reject any reliance on high tax rates for an extended period. With constrained AWC borrowing, growers could have faced the prospects of between 30 and 40 per cent of their wool receipts being taxed over a three- to five-year period. It was often suggested to me that this would discourage production and help bring the supply side under control. However, it is senseless not to give a market signal to growers on price, but only give them one on the tax rate. It is unacceptable, in my view, for a government to use taxing powers to force thousands of growers from the industry. When propositions such as this are raised I sometimes wonder whether it has been forgotten that Australia is a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, for the reasons I have given, it was necessary for me to issue the direction to the Australian Wool Corporation to set and publish next season's reserve price at no more than 700c per kilogram clean. The Government believes that at this level the competitiveness of wool will be restored and stocks, borrowings and the wool tax rate will be able to be brought down to manageable levels more quickly than under the present floor price. The risks of the financial collapse of the AWC or the industry are substantially lower. Furthermore, the decision will restore the reserve price to its original purpose as a floor: to underwrite the market in order to protect growers against large sudden falls in wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In taking the decision to lower the floor, the Government will not contemplate, under any circumstances, further downward movement from this level. The decision of 700c as a floor is immutable. The wool trade can now act with confidence that the price will not be reduced further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given tangible expression in offering to guarantee all borrowings of the Australian Wool Corporation for the next two years. Against this background, the Government has decided that a review of pricing policy in the wool industry should be conducted. The basic aim of such a review would be to analyse changes which have taken place since the current arrangements were introduced in 1974 and to recommend measures to make the arrangements more effective. I will be announcing details of the review at a later date. Let me make this perfectly clear: the Government's commitment to the 700c per kilogram floor is rock solid. Any recommendations will not be allowed to induce another dizzy round of speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of critical importance now is for the AWC and the industry leaders to manage the future, for the sake of the future and for the long-term benefit of growers. I have acted with the greatest reluctance. However, the Government, with the Corporation and with the Wool Council, intends to see the long-term future of growers and the wool industry secured. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool is of key importance to our rural economy and nationally. It contributes approximately 25 per cent of the value of agricultural production. Prior to the recent contraction in demand it was our major export commodity, contributing about $6 billion to our export income in 1988-89. This year its contribution is expected to be around $4 billion. In facing up to the difficulties that lie ahead of the wool industry, I recognise the critical role of wool promotion. The Government accepts its responsibility to assist the Corporation in its promotion and marketing efforts, particularly the new initiatives which have been proposed. Consequently, to boost the AWCs promotion funds, we will extend the Government's contribution to $75m over three years from 1991-92. This will continue from the Government's current commitment of $25m per annum which expires at the end of 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the combination of a high wool tax and a cut in the minimum reserve price will reduce the gross proceeds to growers from wool in the coming season. Of course, the alternative prescription would have done the same. Some small specialists who have few or no production alternatives will be hit hard. </PARA>
<PARA> However, growers' income needs to be considered in the context of what has happened over the past 10 years or so. And not just with the high incomes of the previous boom firmly in mind. With a 700c per kilogram floor and a 20 per cent tax the average cash surplus earned by wool growers in 1990-91 will still be above that earned in 1986-87. In fact, on average, it is projected to be as high as $15,000 above the cash surplus earned by growers in 1986-87. I would remind honourable members that most wool farms only receive about 50 per cent of their incomes from wool-the balance is derived from activities like beef for which the present market is strong. </PARA>
<PARA> In making my decision to reduce the floor I had to weigh up all the risks facing the industry and the short and long-term costs and benefits. Had I agreed to the 870c per kilogram-25 per cent tax proposal, then it is likely that this would have resulted in losses over the longer term of some $11,000 for every wool producing farm in this country. In addition, by 1993-94 the share of the Corporation's debt attributable to each wool producing farm, as a result of the Corporation supporting an 870c per kilogram floor price, would be around $60,000. Should the market worsen, and honourable members of this House can assess the risks associated with the trade into eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, then the prospects for growers under an 870c per kilogram floor would be very bleak indeed. That is why the Government flatly and categorically rejects the concept of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> At this moment, it is not possible to obtain a firm idea of the number of growers who might be affected by the lower floor and higher tax. We recognise, however, that significant pressure may be placed on some individuals. Therefore, the Government is prepared to review the supply of funds under the rural adjustment scheme, including possible carry on assistance and structural adjustment. The intent of the Wool Marketing Act is that I should only use the power that the Parliament has given me to direct the Corporation in exceptional circumstances. In legal terms this means that ordinarily the functions and powers of the AWC are to be exercised without ministerial intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take the opportunity here of reinforcing that intent. It was necessary for me to intervene in this case, because of exceptional circumstances, to ensure the future viability of the wool industry. I hope the need for such action will not arise again. </PARA>
<PARA> In over seven years as the responsible Minister, my main goal has been to get the wool industry and, indeed, other rural industries, to take responsibility for decision-making processes and to move these away from government. My record on reforming statutory marketing arrangements since 1983 speaks for itself. Despite the current events, I do not intend to back-track on what has been achieved in providing autonomy to the statutory marketing authorities, including the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past few weeks the wool industry and its leaders, the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation and the Government have been through an extraordinarily difficult period. The decisions that have now been taken have not been easy for any of us. I am confident that the Board of the Australian Wool Corporation will be able to bring its best commercial expertise to the marketing of the massive stockpile of wool Australia has now. </PARA>
<PARA> Our first priority must be to send messages to our international markets that Australia is committed to the future of its wool industry and will stand firmly behind it. As part of this process, I propose to attend the fifty-ninth International Wool Conference of the International Wool Textile Organisation at Cavtat-Dubrovnik next week to convey this message to the world's processors of wool. I intend to convey this message, in the clearest possible terms, to the processors and manufacturers in Europe. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) in his second reading speech has catalogued some of the events in that period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is disgraceful. I acknowledge that it is essential legislation-that is why we are accepting this procedure at this time-that goes some way to restoring confidence in the wool market following the Government's unprecedented intervention. That intervention initially destroyed the remaining two months of the wool selling season and Australian exports amounting to over $300m, when we need every export dollar, and resulted in an equal loss to growers of this country. By the intervention of the Minister of unilaterally lowering the floor price, the Australian Wool Corporation has lost credit worthiness. The industry has lost the credibility of the floor price system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A statement made yesterday by the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, Mr Beggs, acknowledged this most fragile and dangerous situation now facing the Corporation. It called on the Government to confirm that the 700c new minimum price could not alter. It called on the Government to guarantee borrowings for the Corporation because of its destroyed credit worthiness. That is the purpose of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The action of the Minister yesterday and again in his second reading speech today indicates that the Government has listened to that urgent request of the industry. I commend the Minister and the Government for the action that they are now taking because speed is essential. The Corporation needs a credit rating to be able to maintain its borrowings arrangements. The guarantee that the Government is now putting into the wool marketing legislation is for a two-year period and, I understand, up to the $2 3/4 billion borrowing limit approval, which has already been granted by the Government to the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> Our support for this particular Bill is the first actual open support for the Government for any action it has taken in this very devastating period for the wool industry, which began several months ago. I say again today, as I did in a statement on behalf of the coalition yesterday, along with the Chairman of the Wool Corporation, Mr Beggs, and the President of the Wool Council of Australia, Mr Sawer: the decision has been made and, however reluctantly, sections of the industry ought to accept that decision. I can understand their extreme reluctance, but there is no point doing anything other than accepting that decision, because everybody must be seen to be united to ensure that this great industry of ours is restored to its former viability-not just for the sake of the woolgrowers of Australia but for the sake of all Australians. On a net basis, wool still remains our major export industry, and I believe that the industry will return to that position soon on a gross basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement made on behalf of the coalition confirmed again our belief that it is the industry's right to set the floor. All we were doing was confirming our support for the Minister's own 1987 legislation which enshrined that right and on which the Minister has reneged. The important point is that everyone accepts that the decision has been made and we should get on with it. It is important for wool to be able to move immediately; for sales to continue; to build up confidence, to get those export dollars again; and to keep the Wool Corporation's borrowings at a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the quick action of the Wool Corporation, which yesterday released an action plan for a continuous buying and reselling operation which will start with the reopening of the wool sales again next week-Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in Melbourne and Wednesday and Thursday in Sydney. Over 100,000 bales of wool are to be sold, and about half a million bales of wool are still to be sold before the end of the wool selling season. Only after 1 July can the floor price formally and officially be changed to the new lower level. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that there will be a considerable and very good clearance of wool, but that in no way means that the wool will be cleared because it is being sold at 700c, versus 870c, or at any other level. It will be cleared because buyers have deliberately stayed away from the market for some time and the textile pipeline is about one million bales shorter than it ever has been before, so there is a tremendous pent-up demand out there for wool, and I hope and I believe that, now that everything is finally settled, the clearances will dramatically increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his speech, refers also to promotion. The Wool Corporation, in its final submission to the Minister and the Government, gave details of a new marketing strategy to increase demand in what is sometimes called the middle market, to get better sales for the somewhat coarser types of wool, but still relatively fine wool, in the lighter fabrics that are now favoured by people. This will cost $60m to $70m, and with any marketing strategy it will take time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, by his statement this morning, has removed uncertainty in relation to what happens to the Government's contribution to wool promotion when the present three year Government contribution of $25m per year finishes at the end of the next financial year. The Minister has indicated that it will continue for another three years at the same level. </PARA>

<PARA> In case people think that, somehow, the industry is getting something from government better than anybody else, I remind them that there is no other industry in this country where the individual members of that industry contribute so much to promotion.

<PARA> That also raises the question that the grower contribution to promotion may have to rise from the present 3 3/4 per cent level. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has calculated that of the 20 per cent maximum total wool levy or tax that can now be applied to growers, a maximum of 16 per cent should meet the greatest degree of market support needed by the Wool Corporation. I think that carries with it two omens or two further points: one is that there is a safety margin there for the wool industry if more is needed; and, secondly, there is an ability to increase the promotion levy. But one has to make the cautionary comment that woolgrowers' income will be dramatically reduced and therefore there should be no additional impost on growers without the complete consideration of `is it needed' and what that means to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also referred to rural adjustment, or adjustment that will be needed in the industry. When we look at a 16 per cent levy, which will, I acknowledge, only be there for one year, according to ABARE and its calculations, the woolgrowers are looking at an average reduction of at least 35 per cent and potentially far higher in their income because of this decision. That is a dramatic reduction. The Minister has stated that it is still above the 1986-87 cash income for growers, but of course that has not been adjusted for inflation, and it comes also at a time when we have a Treasurer who continually says that the work force of Australia has suffered no loss whatsoever in real income, yet the woolgrowers of this country are being asked to take at least a 35 to 40 per cent reduction in real income, and they are the components of the most internationally efficient industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister does recognise that there will be growers at risk, big numbers of them, and he has listened to the calls of many people, including me, that the rural adjustment scheme should be used within its limits. One acknowledges the limits; it means only a small percentage will be helped. But at least that has been included in his statement and he makes the point that more funds will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also suggest to the Minister that, as well as keeping an eye on the rural adjustment scheme, where it is necessary to ensure that growers are assisted as much as they can be within the limits of the scheme, a review of the income equalisation deposits (IED) scheme be made. The reality will be that with the dramatic reduction in woolgrowers' incomes the level at which it is worthwhile for growers to participate in IEDs will be reached by very few people. Woolgrowers, as well as having to face the reduction in income, still face the vagaries of our climatic situation. Of course, that is one of the purposes of the IED scheme. I ask the Minister to look again at changing the criteria and the tax levels, et cetera, so that the IED scheme is still relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> This dramatic reduction in growers' income was one of the main points of grower anger directed at the Government over this whole issue. Secondly, the growers' anger has been directed at the disastrous public intervention by the Government, which has ruined the last two months of the wool sales. Thirdly, the growers have been angered at the refusal by the Government to accept the industry proposals, the industry calculations, particularly when the industry itself well remembers that in 1970, 1975 and 1985 the industry backed its judgment against the judgment of all the economists and was proved to be right; and the industry believes that that is still the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the growers' anger has been at the double standard of the Government saying to the industry that it has certain economic policies which means that the industry has to meet the `market'; that foreign borrowing may be good for everybody else but not for the industry; that the `market' is there for the industry but not for other sectors of the economy; and that nothing is being done to address the added costs to all exporters, including growers, as a result of the Government's economic policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment to the Wool Marketing Act 1987 totally guarantees the floor price of 700c. That is what this Act is all about-to give some stability and guarantee to the wool industry. The one pleasing thing that has been said by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd)-and I fully endorse what he said-is that we all need to work together to ensure that we can guarantee that this industry gets back to where it should be; that is, right at the top of the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wool industry has come through some tough times. I guess basically the problems that we face have been a consequence of the fact that the floor price was far too high and we had to acknowledge market forces. That is the reality of the commercial world. I believe that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) has shown leadership and courage in taking the tough decisions. One can never please everybody when there are tough decisions to make. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been interesting to note that there have been arguments on both sides of the fence. One argument was to maintain a high floor price of 870c and the other argument was to bring it down. During the debate various propositions have been put, but at the end of the day what is needed is some tough leadership and some courage; and I believe that that has been shown by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. When there is so much wool stored in stockpiles and when competitors to wool, the synthetics, are able to get access to the market, it is not just a case of spending more money on promotion which will sell our wool. It is the price that matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard arguments many times from the other side about meeting the market forces-a bit of free enterprise. In this instance I think it is inevitable that we had to meet the market. Consequently, I believe that the decision to bring the floor price to 700c has been commonsense. In fact, I was looking at the editorial in the Australian today, a paper that I have much pleasure in reading. It embraces free market forces all the time. It tells us about the new wave that is coming from Victoria to free up the labour market and free up everything else. It was the greatest apologist editorial that I have ever seen. It was about trying to maintain the floor price at 870c. That is an incredible statement. It just makes one wonder how much sincerity really exists when those who charge the barricades in one instance, when it really comes the crunch turn out to be just so many closet agrarian socialists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has shown a lot of courage and guts. That is what is needed in primary industries because there are always tough decisions that have to be made out in the rural sector. I believe that farmers recognise that. As the honourable member for Murray said, as a consequence, farmers will face tough times, with a drop in income of about 30 per cent. But had we maintained that floor price, the borrowings and the interest would have wiped out the value of the stockpiles in about four years. That would have been economic madness. Consequently, I think people really needed to know the way it is. For too long-and I say this in all sincerity-politicians on all sides of the House have often tried to say it the way people like to hear it. It is about time that we said it the way it is. In this instance the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has said it the way it is; that is, that the floor price has to come down and we have to face economic reality. It is about time that everyone got together, faced up to that, and worked to sell and promote our wool. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Murray and the Opposition are going to support us in that regard. It is not the Wool Corporation that is leading the way here; it is the Minister who is leading the way. Everyone else is following the Minister. It is not the Wool Corporation that is leading the way; the Minister has dragged it screaming into this position. I am pleased to see that it is now going to follow him and his determination to see a revitalised wool industry because it is the Minister's ideal, not the Wool Corporation's, that is going to lead us into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are talking about borrowings, I believe that as a consequence of the dropping of the price we are going to save $1 billion. I would like to see consideration given to spending a large amount of money, if the Wool Corporation wants to gamble, in developing a fully integrated wool and textile industry here in Australia. Some consideration should be given to value adding the whole industry in this country and producing the final product here. I think it is madness to sell a raw product overseas and to let the buyers over there turn it into a finished garment. We should look at having a high technology industry right here in Australia. That should be considered along with wool promotion. I believe that we now have to get together and work to ensure that the wool industry does take its rightful place again as the leading exporter in primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to compensation, the Minister has spelt that out very clearly. If we had not dropped the floor price the industry would have lost $1 billion. So the argument for compensation is silly. I believe that the Wool Corporation will support the Government. I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Murray and the Opposition are supporting it. All we need to do now is get on with the job and work together to ensure that this industry does get back to where it belongs. The vagaries of the marketplace are something that we always have to endure. At present sugar is on a high; it was down three years ago. Wool will come back. Wool has been good in the past. Only two years ago it was over 1,200c. We should take cognisance of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the labour market and labour market reform that was commented on, I would like to say that no group in society has demonstrated such sacrifice and commitment to this economy as has the labour market, the workers of this country-the six million people who work and sell only one commodity, their labour. They have seen a reduction in real terms of more than 10 per cent. They are prepared to do that to see a better economy. It makes me wonder when people say that the labour market has to carry the can. It is carrying the can. It is prepared to do that. It has a commitment to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The other interesting thing in regard to this wool debate is that throughout the debate, while we have heard the squattocracy put forward its views of closet agrarian socialism and the Opposition, particularly the National Party, has agonised over this issue-I am pleased to see that the Liberal Party has supported us all the way down the line-no-one asked the shearers what their views are. They too have an income and an interest in this industry. No-one has asked them. There are thousands of shearers involved in the wool industry. No-one on the other side has ever bothered to ask what they think about the floor price going down. That is the sad thing. It is interesting to note that next year we are going to celebrate 100 years since Barcaldine, under that tree, where the shearers did have an impact, importance and input into this country-that is, in the formation of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Workers Union. At the end of the day they and the wool industry will be there. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to support this amendment. We have had to face challenge in this industry. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has had the courage to make some tough decisions. He has to wear a few bullets. At the end of the day history will judge that he has had the guts to do that. At the same time as he has done that the Opposition has been divided. The Opposition has sat on a barbed wire fence, as Don Chipp once said, and lost the ball game. It is interesting to see that at a time when there are tough decisions to be taken the new revitalised National Party has gone to water on this issue. It is the Minister who is the prime minister of the bush. It is good to see that this amendment has been made and that the floor price has come down to 700c. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member did not. He said that he supported the amendment and I was pleased to hear it. I am sorry to hear the honourable member for Hinkler refer to those old hackneyed words such as `squattocracy' and make the mistake of thinking that in the short term shearers' wages would be affected by the arrangements and the unfortunate happenings in the wool industry today. Of course, shearers' wages in the short term will not be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until several years ago the Government provided a guarantee against borrowings by the Wool Corporation. At that time the industry, and presumably the Government, thought that it was sophisticated enough to have more autonomy and less government back-up. As such it was prepared to relinquish that government guarantee. It obviously thought that it was able to handle itself with less government support. I must say that I was one of those who was in favour of added independence for the wool industry and would therefore normally not be in favour of running back to the Government for support. However, in these circumstances I see no alternative but to embrace this proposition of a guarantee immediately in the interests of price stability and user confidence and in the national interest. I understand that it is not an open-ended guarantee, that it is for $2.5 billion and that it is to last for two years. </PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that the office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) is not yet sure whether this AWC borrowing will be caught by the Commonwealth borrowing levy. I understand that that matter is being examined by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) at this time. I also note that the proposition is that the promotion contribution of the Government will go back to the recent arrangements of $25m a year and will go on from the years 1991-92 for three years, but will not go back to the old arrangements which I negotiated, if I remember rightly, with the Minister when I had been President of the Wool Council of Australia for some time and he was a very new Minister. We negotiated a contribution based on a percentage of the gross proceeds of the wool clip. </PARA>

<PARA> In regard to the reserve price itself, this matter has been difficult for the Opposition. Firstly, there are only three players that can get into the game under the new arrangements that were brought in several years ago. Those three players are the Australian Wool Corporation, the Wool Council of Australia and the Government. They are the players and the rest of us can only make noises. Secondly, over the last two or three weeks the industry has repeatedly told us that it is its decision and it is its negotiation to have with the Government. Many of us in the Opposition were asked to keep out of the debate at least until the last few days. I have to say that in the main that wish has been observed. </PARA>
<PARA> We also had some difficulty in following the positions of the industry as it moved fleetingly only several months ago from a 15 per cent tax through to a 20 per cent tax to a 25 per cent tax and, as late as last Friday, a 25 per cent tax for five years, and, as I understand it, subsequently to a modified position. Not only have we had some difficulty in following those positions, but many of us, I have to confess, were unconvinced by the figures as we extracted them. </PARA>
<PARA> Questions were raised in our minds, some of which have already been raised this morning. Firstly, would the Corporation survive at 870c if there was still to be a stockpile, for example, of between 4.5 and 5.5 million bales at the end of June 1995? Many of the simulations that the Corporation has done show just those sorts of figures. This was the prognosis of the Corporation, and it seemed to suggest to us that there would be wool still in the stockpile in the year 2000 that is currently being held. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, what were the borrowing arrangements for a debt of $4 billion and above? Many of us on this side of the House were unconvinced that the Wool Corporation could survive holding such stocks over such a long time and that it would give rise to debts of this order. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now generally accepted that the setting of a reserve price two years ago at 870c was a mistake. Anyone who does not think so belongs to the group who wishes to push the price. History shows unequivocally that such systems invariably fail. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the mere doubling of the floor price in two years has been a tragic mistake. It has been called a floor price. It was called a floor price back in the early days-in the early 1970s-for very good reasons. Those reasons were that it initially made provision for wool to be brought in at a price below which the growers simply refused to sell to the world. Firstly, that price was one which we believed could be sustained over time. It was not a price which was designed to set the market for wool throughout a year or over the years. It was a base price which we could afford to provide the finance for and one which, as I said, we could sustain. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it was a price which was to give some predictability to the buyer. That varies from country to country because buyers currencies vary from day to day. In fact, the only currency in which the price is constant is Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier in this debate, in the early 1970s we were looking at trying to maintain a sheep flock of just over 130 million when the flock was going down. Therefore, as time went on, the reserve price started to bear some relation to the size of that flock and to the maintenance of that flock. The 130 million in the early 1980s was low in historical terms. We wanted to make sure that the price was not set so low that we actually could not provide our customers with enough wool. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the price was discussed many times. It was not supposed to be a price that was directly related to the cost of production, but in an indirect sense it became just that. It most certainly was not supposed to be a price which became the floor price which became the market price. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some lessons to be learned from this. It is often said that universities and such places are full of knowledge. The freshman brings some in, the senior takes little out, and therefore knowledge accumulates. I hope that the wool industry in this circumstance is accumulating some knowledge, and I most certainly hope that the Government is. I would now like to turn to the subject of the Government's performance in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of record that the Government did not set up a mechanism several years ago by which the floor could be lowered without interim disruption to the marketplace. We have had that interim disruption to the marketplace. It follows that the Government did not anticipate that a fall was possible. Of course, we know that such a fall in the floor price was not only undesirable; it turned out to be quite tragic. The floor price should never fall. It should be set at a level which is sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister I note has been quite voluble on the subject of sustainable agriculture of late, and I agree with him. Nevertheless, the Minister did set up an arrangement whereby parts of the industry were able, in various states of excitement about high prices at the time, to push the price. For that he must take his part of the blame, just as a designer of any system which seriously malfunctions must take the blame. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not noticed anyone taking much responsibility in this debate until now. It is time one or two people admitted to some of it. I for one take some responsibility for not being able to persuade in the past those people who I have just mentioned who have always wanted to make the floor price the market price. I am sad that I have been unable to dissuade them from the idiocy of their ways. I do not have any philosophical basis for saying that, but simply the historical fact that every industry which has tried to push its price has finally finished under the water. The old principles of the very successful floor price scheme-and it was a very successful floor price scheme and will be again-still hold. If those principles were observed again, then quite simply, the scheme would be a success again. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a few furphies put about over the last few weeks. One of them is that the dropping of the price to 700c will put more people out of business than having, for instance, a tax of 25 per cent for three or five years. The Wool Corporation's figures do not show that. The Wool Corporation's figures show that at around about the middle of this decade, on either of these two precepts, we will have dropped off around a quarter of our wool clip. I happen to think that that will not quite happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The second furphy that is around is that 700c as a reserve in itself will break a lot of people. I do not believe that that is true. What may be true is that if that price is combined with a very high tax for a long period many more people may go under. In itself, 700c, 680c, or 740c or any other such figure is not a figure that is going to break a lot of woolgrowers. I base that remark on the fact that everybody now recognises that 870c is a reserve price that is too profitable, and we thus have too many sheep in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a third idea about that we will need to hold a substantial stockpile, even as high as two or three million bales, people are saying, to stabilise the marketplace. I hope that somebody has worked out the cost of such a holding because I believe it is quite monstrous. It is somewhere in the order of $500m to $700m a year, depending on the interest rate. That new thought should be very seriously examined before anybody embarks on that road.</PARA>
<PARA> Our amendment is to condemn the Government. I have brushed upon that matter. There is no doubt that if interest rates were at reasonable levels, then the interest rate component of $180 of storage per year for a bale of wool would not be so high. If the exchange rate had not been held up by the interest rate parachute, then again we would sell more wool because it would be cheaper to people in other parts of the world in other currencies who buy our wool. If the rate of progress on the waterfront had been anything but slow and abysmal-had it been at any pace better than that-lots of things in that area would have improved. We can go all through those areas and criticise the Government for the lack of pace of its change. </PARA>
<PARA> To come back to one area that was mentioned by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), had we not had the removal of income equalisation deposits some seven or nine years ago, for reasons that I regard as spurious, many of those growers who were in a good position in the last two years would not have been put in the position where their ability to save had been affected detrimentally. The whole purpose of the IED scheme was to put in place to some extent an averaging ability, but more than that-to enable people to put money into the bank at low interest rates, albeit held by the Government, and to be able to pull it out again in bad times. Unfortunately this Government, early in its tenure, saw fit to remove the IED scheme and, when it put it back, it was far too late and not in a form that has been taken up with enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, this has been a sad event. I hope that some lessons have been learned not only by the industry but by the Government and by us all. As the Chairman of the Wool Corporation has said, it is time that we all got back to work and got on with it. It is time that we put out of our minds our particular ideas as to what has been right and wrong in the last few days, that we support the Corporation, that we support the industry and that we make sure-as this Bill will help to do-that those people who buy our wool and who therefore are our greatest sellers of this commodity at the other end of the world are reassured by these arrangements and we get on with the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a few points on the amendment and to pick up a couple of points in the debate, for which I thank honourable members. I will make two points of clarification. First of all, there is no link between the $2.5 billion and the guarantee. The guarantee is open-ended for two years for the borrowings raised. It is very important that the Government guarantee be not undermined in any way. Secondly, as to the comments of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the borrowing levy that he referred to does not apply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the amendment, I must point out that it is not strictly relevant to the purpose of the Wool Marketing Amendment Bill 1990. Of course, general economic conditions impinge on the wool industry just as the wool industry impinges on the general state of the economy. I point out, however, that these problems with the economy are not the cause primarily of the 4:1 variation in the price of wool and the price of substitutes. The Government rejects the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Aeronautical Research Laboratory site, Fishermens Bend, Vic. </PARA>
<PARA>The Aeronautical Research Laboratories, or ARL, are part of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation of the Department of Defence. Their terms of reference are to develop, maintain and exploit scientific and technological skills and facilities in areas generally central to military air vehicles and relevant aspects of weapons for the benefit of the Australian Defence Force. Existing laboratory and office accommodation at ARL is overcrowded and unsuitable for effective research, development and investigation in a number of areas of technology. Until 30 June 1988, ARL operated from a 9.55 hectare site at Fishermens Bend, Port Melbourne, leased from the Victorian State Government for a period of 50 years. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) occupied an adjacent 2.75 hectare site also leased from the Victorian State Government under the same arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> On expiry of the leases on 30 June 1988, the entire 12.3 hectare site was purchased by the Commonwealth from the State Government. The Department of Defence is planning to purchase useable ex-CSIRO buildings on the site this financial year with the aim of refurbishing them, and some existing ARL buildings, to accommodate the expansion of ARL. The redevelopment proposal evolved from a need to rationalise the operation and management of the research facility and will provide badly needed laboratory and office space enabling certain staff to be collocated. </PARA>
<PARA> Health and safety surveys and site investigations commissioned by Defence and arranged by Australian Construction Services identified areas of hazardous chemical and radiation contamination on the ex-CSIRO site. Specifically, asbestos and dangerous wastes have been found in, or near, buildings previously used by the CSIRO and steps are being taken to manage the disposal of both. In addition, low levels of radiation detected within, or near, 10 buildings have now been cleared. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Defence will be monitoring and surveying the removal of the contaminants from the site and a proviso written into the environmental certificate of compliance that construction will not proceed until the site is clear of contaminants will be strictly observed. </PARA>
<PARA> The project will consist largely of refurbishment and demolition works and will provide functional laboratory facilities to support the advanced technologies embodied in recent aircraft acquisitions such as the FA18 fighter, Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters. The works will also rectify temporary arrangements for laboratories, workshops and offices that have evolved over the past 40 years and rationalise facilities and accommodation. Also included is the provision of roads and car parking, additional electrical power to refurbished buildings, extension of the existing ARL security system to ex-CSIRO buildings and extension of the communication ducting network. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost estimate for the proposed work, at December 1988 prices, is $16.2m and the work will be undertaken in two phases to accommodate funding arrangements of ARL. Commencement of phase A is planned for 1990-91. The proposed work is expected to provide employment on site for some 50 people and opportunities for the local building industry. I table selected plans of the proposed redevelopment of the ARL site and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this debate I indicate that the Opposition obviously supports this move and sees that it is important that the Aeronautical Research laboratory does, in fact, move to this or a similar site. We also believe that it is important that it stays in Melbourne because clearly the main customers of the research laboratory are in Melbourne, namely, the Royal Australian Air Force and, to a lesser extent, other services. Therefore, I think it is important from a practical point of view and from an economical point of view to maintain that proximity. It is also very important to see that this site is cleared of its contaminants and radioactive waste which, apparently, were discovered when the proposal to move to this site was first being undertaken. I look forward to the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works taking the opportunity to expedite this decision as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this particular matter and make a comment of a personal nature about the reference of the redevelopment of the Aeronautical Research Laboratory site at Fishermens Bend, Victoria, to the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. This reference comes back to the House having been brought to the House previously during the last parliamentary session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that the role of the Public Works Committee, a joint statutory committee of this Parliament, is to look at references and consider, where appropriate if the Committee deems it necessary, other alternatives for the expenditure of capital funds. That is the role of the Committee and the Parliament has empowered it to make that determination. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to this particular proposal, there is another proposal from Tasmania, which was lodged with the Committee under its previous terms of reference and which has now been re-endorsed, for the consideration of a site in Tasmania. The Committee has already voted to conduct an inspection in Tasmania of the proposal that has been put forward. I just want to draw to the attention of honourable members that that is taking place, and that it is a proper function of the Committee, albeit that it might be to the displeasure of those within the Defence, Science and Technology Organisation who have expressed that view publicly, in advance, I might say, of consideration by the Committee. I believe it to be an incorrect statement on their part, and of a public nature. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of Perth office and warehouse complex for the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1988 the Civil Aviation Authority purchased land at Perth Airport with the view of relocating to the airport all office-based staff presently located in leased office space in the central business district. Investigation into the economic feasibility of this proposition confirmed that the construction of a new office complex would reduce the overall cost of the CAA's Western Australian accommodation expenses. The financial analysis also involved the disposal of the existing warehouse site at Mount Claremont, Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the project comprises: 5,438 square metres of office space, on two levels inclusive of reception area and staff amenities; 1,120 square metres of warehouse space; provision for 177 staff, fleet and visitor parking bays; systems furniture installation, consistent with modern working conditions: landscaping of site, including the retention of existing trees where practicable and mechanical, electrical, PABX and security services, consistent with the latest cost-effective technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The CAA's estimate of costs based on an October 1991 completion date totals $13.9m. This includes full allowance for cost escalation, furniture and fittings, PABX, consultant fees and contingencies. The work is being designed by private consultants to comply with the requirements of relevant authorities, and is consistent with the Commonwealth's accommodation guidelines. Extensive consultation has occurred with relevant staff associations on all aspects of the facilities to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to ensure earliest termination of existing leases totalling $100,000 per month, the CAA seeks to award a contract for the construction works by late August 1990 and to achieve completion during October 1991. I table preliminary building layout drawings of the proposal and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Dedicated computer centre for the Australian Taxation Office, Bruce, Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the construction of a dedicated computer centre for the Australian Taxation Office on Commonwealth land at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory. Honourable members may recall that approval to refer this proposal was given at the sitting of this House on 21 December 1989. Although a hearing by the former Public Works Committee had been scheduled for 26 February 1990, this did not eventuate because of the election. The need for referral is a consequence of the original motion having lapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office is undergoing a complete modernisation of its business operation and has an urgent requirement to accommodate its new computer equipment in a secure and stable environment. The existing taxation computer facility in the Treasury building has outlived its functional usefulness and cannot provide for expansion needs over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed building of 6,300 square metres will consist of two levels. The computer mainframe and operations will be on the upper floor level while plant, dispatch, loading dock, storage, staff amenities and office accommodation will be on the ground floor level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bruce site, adjacent to the Fern Hill Technology Park development, was found to be the most appropriate and effective location for meeting Australian Taxation Office needs, now and in the future. The limit of cost estimate for the proposal is $21.85m at December 1989 prices. I table drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> I guess one could make one comment here-that it is amazing how long it has taken for this Government to realise the need to do something like this. Committee reports over a number of years during the life of this Labor Government have indicated time and again that the Australian Taxation Office is in need of this type of facility, and has been hampered in doing its job efficiently because of delays in getting around to providing this sort of facility. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looked back through reports of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, the Auditor-General's reports and other reports that have been presented to the Parliament one would find that for at least five years-probably longer-it has been obvious that the Tax Office has had many shortcomings and much of these can be attributed to the lack of modern equipment. While we would certainly like to see this reference considered by the Public Works Committee as quickly as possible, I have to say that the Government ought to explain in more detail why it has taken so long to get around to doing something like this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill would amend the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to allow the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, or Comcare as it is known, to take account of the amount that former employees are able to earn in calculating their rate of weekly benefits. The Bill would also ensure that the Act applies to the non-police staff members of the Australian Federal Police appointed since 1 January 1990, when certain new employment arrangements for these staff took effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Comcare was established to administer legislation on safety, rehabilitation and compensation for Commonwealth employees which came into effect on 1 December 1988. The objectives of the new scheme are to reduce the incidence and costs of work related injury in Commonwealth employment; to return injured employees to work as soon as possible; to provide fairer income related benefits for injured workers; to make employers more accountable for the costs of injury, illness and unsafe workplaces; and to improve the efficiency of decision making about compensation entitlements. Comcare has made significant progress towards achieving these objectives with an approach based on the integration of prevention, rehabilitation and compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> The new benefits package, which came into effect on 1 December 1988, reduces the financial hardship formerly experienced by injured workers, especially those with long term work disabilities. Early intervention by rehabilitation experts ensures that programs are implemented and employees return to work in far greater numbers and sooner than before. The premium system provides incentives to encourage the prevention of workplace injuries and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured or sick workers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the new legislation Comcare has been able to achieve a saving of $12m, or 14 per cent, of the projected cost made between December 1988 and June 1989. This corresponds to a full year saving of around $20m. These savings have been made possible, notwithstanding the generally higher level of benefits payable to injured workers, because of the emphasis on reducing the incidence of injury and rehabilitating those employees unfortunate enough to be injured at work. Comcare's premiums are comprehensive and competitive. There are no excess payments or hidden costs. Comcare's average premium in 1989-90 was 2.6 per cent of salary, which compares favourably with 3 per cent charged in reformed State schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The new scheme has produced significant reductions in the duration of claims. The average length of claims in general has been reduced and, more importantly, there are fewer new claims becoming long term claims. These trends are occurring sooner than expected and are generating substantial savings to the Commonwealth and its authorities which are now directly responsible for the costs associated with work related injuries. As a result, the average premium rate for the 1990-91 financial year is expected to fall from 2.6c per wage and salary dollar to 2c. The immediate reduction in the duration of claims under the new scheme and the expected reduction in premium rates demonstrate the real value of the new approach which is achieving this Government's goals of reducing both the human and financial costs of work related injuries. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which would be made to the Act by this Bill have significant implications. The Bill would amend sections 131 and 132 of the Act, which relate to the amount of compensation payable to former employees. Former employees are defined in the Act to mean persons who were receiving compensation under the repealed Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 and who had ceased to be employees of the Commonwealth before the commencement of the Act on 1 December 1988. Special transitional provisions were included in the Act to protect former employees from the full operation of certain provisions of the Act, such as the age 65 cut-off of benefits and the dollar for dollar reduction in compensation benefits payable to persons entitled to weekly superannuation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 131 and 132 of the Act set out methods of calculating the amount of weekly compensation payable to former employees. Section 131 deals with those former employees who are in receipt of superannuation benefits, while section 132 applies to those with no superannuation entitlements. As currently drafted, neither section allows Comcare to have any regard to the amount that former employees are able to earn in suitable employment. `Able to earn' tests of this nature are common to all workers compensation Acts in Australia. However, a provision which would have enabled Comcare to have regard to the amount that former employees are capable of earning was omitted from the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments provide that the amount of compensation payable to a former employee who has a residual capacity for work will be either the amount that he or she is currently receiving, less the amount that he or she is able to earn in suitable employment; or the amount payable under the Act to a current employee of the Commonwealth with similar earning capacity, whichever is greater. In determining the amount that a former employee is able to earn, the Commission will have regard to the same factors as it would have regard to in determining the amount that a current employee is able to earn. </PARA>
<PARA> These factors include the amount that the employee is actually earning; the amount that the employee would be earning if he or she had remained in, or accepted an offer of, suitable employment; and if the employee failed to seek suitable employment, the amount that, having regard to the state of the labour market, the employee could reasonably expect to earn if he or she had sought work. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Act that would be made by this Bill are expected to result in a saving to Comcare of approximately $3m in a full year. Additional savings will be made by the two administering authorities, Telecom Australia and Australia Post. The amendments would come into operation on a date to be proclaimed and claimants will be advised of the possible reduction in their benefits, as a result of these amendments, in order to minimise their impact. The amendment to section 5 of the Act would remove any doubt that non-police staff of the Australian Federal Police are covered by the Act. Prior to the beginning of this year, non-police staff were appointed under the Public Service Act and, as public servants, were covered by the Compensation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, non-police staff have been appointed under the Australian Federal Police Act and a question has arisen whether those new appointees fall within the definition of `employee' in section 5 of the Compensation Act. The amendment will make it clear that the Act does apply to non-police staff of the Australian Federal Police. Although most of the appointments will not occur until July 1990, some have been made already. Accordingly, it has been necessary to make this amendment retrospective to 1 January 1990 to make sure that the people concerned have been covered from the date of their appointment. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other speakers, I have been caught a little bit unawares by the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill being brought on for debate at this time, but I am very pleased to speak on it nonetheless. It is important that we alter the Comcare Act as is required, as the Government sees fit to do from time to time, in regard to retired Commonwealth employees' benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about other aspects of Comcare's administration, which I would like to talk about for a moment. They relate to the administration by Telecom Australia of Comcare. In my electorate I have received quite a number of complaints from ex-Commonwealth employees who have worked for Telecom and who have had severe repetitive strain injury and whose cases have been dealt with unfairly by Telecom. There has been a lack of trust in the dealings of Telecom with those employees. That is something we need to look at in legislation that may come before the House in the form of future amendments to the Comcare Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see the Minister for Fin- ance (Mr Willis) who represents the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) making some amendments today with regard to retired Commonwealth workers, but there are also very good reasons for looking at the way the Act is administered by statutory authorities. If people are injured at work the idea of Comcare and the Act itself is to ensure that they are properly rehabilitated and given every opportunity to seek that rehabilitation before being compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that a lot of the people who have raised this problem are women who have been working in, perhaps, the switchboard area where obviously there is quite a lot of repetitive strain injury occurring. Regrettably, they are not being offered opportunities for rehabilitation. There are other ways that Telecom can look after these people through light duties where these exist. With voice-operated switchboards, they can also now be given jobs in this area because, of course, they still possess all of the expertise that they previously had, but are unable to use their arms and wrists in the same way. Some repetitive strain injury and over use conditions are exacerbated by air-conditioning. Honourable members on this side of the House may wish to think about that as they work in air-conditioned buildings, such as this one, for long per- iods of time. </PARA>
<PARA> My experience with Telecom on compensation and rehabilitation matters has been quite unsatisfactory. I have written to Telecom several times in an endeavour to ensure that it administers the Act in the way I think it should be, allowing people to have an opportunity of satisfactory rehabilitation before condemning them to a life of reliance on compensation outside the work force. This is obviously an unsatisfactory arrangement for the employees and for the statutory authority which, under the Comcare Act, has to pick up the bill completely. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a tendency to rule people out of compensation on the basis of one medical opinion when that medical opinion suits the employer-in this case Telecom. On the other hand, injured employees are made to go to as many as five, six, seven or sometimes more doctors when their claim is supported. But as they find one who does not support them, then it is that doctor's medical evidence that is selected and used in favour of the employer and to question the employee's right to compensation or rehabilitation. The other doctors' opinions are not taken into account. This is a very serious problem which I was intending to raise in a grievance debate and I will refer to it again with more specific information on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Comcare has within its realm the ability to transfer to statutory authorities the administration after a short period of time-that is, two years. That two years is coming to an end shortly. I wanted to make that point-not to the Minister here as I realise it is not his portfolio responsibility entirely-and draw it to the attention of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) who now has responsibility for these types of Bills. I also draw it to the attention of Senator Richardson. It should also be drawn to the attention of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), given that Telecom comes under his portfolio responsibility. Much of what it does in this area of compensation is of concern to many members of parliament. Similar problems do not seem to be occurring with Australia Post. Therefore, it is a matter of concern to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill, as the Minister has said, amends the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to allow the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, which is Comcare, to take account of the amount that former employees are able to earn in calculating their rate of weekly benefits. It will ensure that the Act applies to non-police staff members of the Australian Federal Police appointed since 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House thoroughly support the Comcare legislation. The alterations to it, I believe, would have been done with sufficient consultation with people concerned and I am sure would be assisting their arrangements in their retirement from the Commonwealth's employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many workers in the community who are very concerned-those of us who spend our time in this place are constantly assailed by our many constituents who express concern-about compensation and the various issues that relate to the way in which they are protected in the work force. One of the most meaningful things that any government or any legislator can do is improve the circumstances of those who are needing compensation because of work related problems and injuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill, as it relates to Comcare, is very important. There has been some concern expressed, as the Opposition spokesman suggested, about the employees' groups concerning this fact and the able to earn clause and how it will relate to their actual payments. I share the concern expressed by the shadow spokesman on this area because these sorts of calculations will necessarily be subjective. The judgments on whether or not a person is able to earn a certain salary and the prospects that they have are not easy to make. There is seldom a black or white answer as to what one's capability is. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the sort of injuries that occur at work, one will see that the area of concern that relates to compensation most often seems to be back injuries. The area where I would say the medical profession struggles most in the treatment of compensation cases is the area of back injuries. One finds time and again people who have had serious back injuries for long periods of time coming before medical boards and medical specialists. They have their cases reassessed, they work for short periods and they have a relapse. These sorts of cases create log-jams for the medical profession-certainly before legal boards and certainly before those who wish to provide compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the medical profession would agree that it is an area which is very badly treated. It is an area where we find continual difficulty in establishing what is the best way of treating these people. What is their capability to work? Do they have the possibility of being able to earn substantial salaries? Are they capable of working full time? Perhaps they have to change the type of duties in which they are involved. Those sorts of dilemmas face those involved with determining compensation and ability to work claims time and again. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important aspects of this-I have been speaking over the last couple of years with those involved in treating back injuries in particular-is that the critical part of the treatment of such injuries is rehabilitation. I think this stems from a cultural thing or perhaps something that is built up over a long period of time. I spoke yesterday in the grievance debate about this issue, about the aspect that there are too many injured workers expecting the medical profession-expecting doctors-to be able to solve the problem. They expect a quick fix and an easy cure. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no simple solution, particularly with back injuries which form the bulk of our compensation cases. A well-known philosopher, H. L. Mencken, said that for every complex problem there is a simple solution, and it is usually wrong. That is the case when it comes to back injuries. It is clear that the most important component for dealing with these problems is rehabilitation, which means that patients have to get off their backsides and work at getting themselves right again. The ethos, the cultural belief, out there in our community is that there can be a quick fix or an easy solution to the problem; that Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet can solve--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TD4">Dr CHARLESWORTH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was misled by the honourable member for Bennelong, who is always drawn to this place when I am on my feet. When we come to dealing with compensation cases, and particularly when one is talking about the bulk of these cases which represent back problems, then the solution is rehabilitation. We are not willing very often to tell the patient in these cases that really they have to do a lot of hard work to get themselves back into the able to earn category. The able to earn category is the part of this legislation that those within the employee groups are concerned about, because there will necessarily be subjective judgments made about their capacity to earn and their ability to be productive members of the work force. Whether or not they are going to be producing effectively, whether they are able to return to their former level of activity or are only capable of working at a lower rate-what we might call light duties-or whether they need to be trained in another way are necessarily subjective judgments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no simple way one can look at a patient's X-ray and say, `We can see this anomaly on the X-ray, and this means that they will not be capable of lifting a wheelbarrow full of cement'; or, `We can look at this X-ray and say that this nurse will not be able to move a sick patient in the hospital bed and, therefore, she has to work in another area or accept different duties'. What is very clear is that some people who have beautiful looking X-rays suffer severe pain and other people who have rotten looking X-rays are capable of doing very hard and difficult labours. </PARA>
<PARA> Those sorts of judgments are made by doctors, and in the end what we need to have is some cultural change whereby people accept that an important part of the process of their treatment is their rehabilitation and the amount of work and effort that they can provide. If that means that one has to get into the swimming pool and swim up and down the pool-as I know honourable members of this House do, although not necessarily those with back injuries-then that is the sort of effort that needs to be provided and the intensive treatment that can bring about a rehabilitation and a return to one's former working capacity. I believe that it is important that that point be made, and employee and employer groups and, indeed, the medical profession have to accept that that is part of their role. </PARA>
<PARA> What we find, of course, is that people get a back injury and find themselves on the medical merry-go-round. They arrive in the doctor's office and he makes an assessment of the problem as best he can. Unfortunately, the general practitioner learns very little about the treatment of complex back injuries, so the patient ends up after a few weeks of physiotherapy and the doctor failing to solve the problem being sent on to the orthopaedic surgeon. The orthopaedic surgeon likes to sharpen the blade and is thinking about the doctor-dollar relationship, but before he does that-and in most cases it would be precipitous of him to recommend surgery too early-the patient might be sent off to the neurologist, because the neurologist needs to make an assessment of the particular neurological deficit that might exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are like sharks in the water tank, just snapping away there. The patient continues to have physiotherapy, again expecting the magic bullet. The physiotherapist provides magical ultrasonic treatment and various exercise programs, but after six months the problem remains. Sometimes the patient then goes off to the pain clinic, and all sorts of other treatments are suggested and projected such as epidural injections, which are very controversial at the moment, as honourable members will have heard, and eventually the patient comes back to the orthopaedic surgeon or the neurosurgeon. If anyone is listening, I suggest that neurosurgeons are a better bet because they tend to deal more kindly with nerves and neural tissue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then the decision is made: is it surgery or not? In most cases we do not need that option. It is very clear when surgery is the solution of choice. That sort of medical merry-go-round goes on for years and years, and it is very frustrating for patients. It is impossible to judge what is actually happening. In the end, the case is decided by the level of pain. Of course, nobody can make a judgment on that except the patient himself, and that causes great frustration for the patient, great depression, a loss of confidence and, certainly very often in family relationships, a loss of the classical relationship that exists between the wage-earner and the rest of the family group. The problems are indeed considerable. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation enables those who are receiving compensation payments to have factored into those payments the other amounts of capital that they are able to earn. Indeed, it factors in superannuation payments that they may be receiving. If one looks at Comcare and its efficiency, we find, as was mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech, that over the time of its operation it has been very successful in curtailing expenditure-and, indeed, savings in a full year of about $20m are significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is an area in which the Government has made some progress. If this legislation, which is supported by the Opposition, can tighten up the proposals and can make more efficient the way in which compensation payments are made and compensation treatment is provided, then the progress we have made so far will have been useful. There are factors that need to be taken into account which are, as I have already said, subjective. The savings that this legislation bring about are about $3m in a full year. Many would suggest that there is a lot of pain in this decision for very little gain. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are about in this place is trying to make more efficient those things that we are responsible for in Commonwealth expenditure; and, although in the context of the whole Budget $3m seems a very small amount, it is a very significant saving. We need to be very aware of the fact that every $3m that we can save means that we can perhaps provide a better service in our education system; it means that perhaps we can provide better funding for our hospitals; and it means that we can provide better services for those who are in need of assistance through the Commonwealth. It is important that we target our Commonwealth expenditure. I believe that this legislation, while only a small part of that, is something that needs to be continued by us. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that there will be a reduction in the duration of claims as a result of this legislation and the average premium rate should reduce. Those things are further indicative of the fact that we have become more efficient in the way in which Comcare is structured and the way in which payments are meted out. I believe that is a significant advance. </PARA>

<PARA> It is with great pleasure that I support the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment Bill, which is an important component, as the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) have made clear, of making sure either that people can get back into the work force or are at least able to cope while they are not in the work force-in this case people employed by the Commonwealth. At 10 to one today, if I can get away from this establishment for half an hour, I will be presenting certificates to people who have done training in eight-week retail courses at Queanbeyan. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that almost every training course that is now adopted by the Commonwealth Employment Service, or Skillshare in this case-particularly the farm courses-involves training in safety. It is not so long ago that I presented certificates to the sawmill at Bega, which had the best safety record in the region. At that presentation I noticed that quite a number of the people who received certificates had fingers missing. If we go to any sawmill today we will find that the younger people have all their fingers. This is because of the training programs and the rehabilitation and preventive work that the honourable member for Perth talked about-implemented not only in training sessions, but also on the job. It is all extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is making sure that people receiving assistance in rehabilitation receive it in a just and fair way. Some of the amendments involved ensure that the Act applies to non-police staff members of the Australian Federal Police who have been appointed since 1 January 1990 when certain new employment arrangements took effect. Others allow the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees to have regard to the amount that former employees are able to earn in suitable employment. The amount that former employees are able to earn would reduce their entitlement to compensation under the Act. Provisions of this nature are normal in workers compensation legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act currently provides for reductions in the benefits payable to current employees who are capable of earning income from suitable employment. The non-inclusion of an able to earn test in the provisions relating to the calculation of weekly benefits payable to former employees was the result of an omission which occurred in the development of the Act. It is estimated that the amendments to the Act will be made clear by this Bill and will save the Commission approximately $3m in a full year. Additional savings will be made by the two administering authorities-Telecom Australia and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is an extremely important move to ensure that full application is given to the original intention of Comcare. We have a clause which ensures that the Act would apply to non-police staff of the Federal Police, as I said before. However, recent amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act provide for the engagement of these persons in future by appointment under that Act. Clause 3 will remove any doubt that staff members so appointed would be covered by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Under subclause 2-I am sure that I will not get a further opportunity in the committee stage of the bill to discuss these matters, so I will discuss them very briefly now-the retrospective commencement of this provision would ensure that all staff members of the Australian Federal Police, including those who have been appointed since 1 January under the new arrangements provided for in the Australian Federal Police Act, would be entitled to claim compensation under the Act for any injuries suffered by them from that date. It is with great pleasure that I support the legislation and its role in the full development of adequate and caring policies for people who come under Comcare.</PARA>

<PARA> Later on this day, with the concurrence of members of the Opposition, when I can get a chance to speak to them about that, we will need to introduce a piece of legislation in that regard.

<PARA> As I indicated last night, we support the proposition that Senate Whips should be paid the same as House Whips. What was overlooked last night, it must be said by the Government as well as by the Opposition, was that in agreeing to that we created a number of further anomalies. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is sitting next to the Minister in charge of the Bill, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), will know a great deal about anomalies and relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more interesting results of the legislation passed last night was to make the salary of the National Party Whip in the Senate exactly the same as the salary of the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. That may have been momentarily attractive to the National Party Whip in the Senate. It has a double significance in that particular case because he is retiring soon. Be that as it may, we certainly support the notion that Senate Whips should be paid the same as the House Whips. We certainly agree with the concerns expressed by a number of Opposition senators that the hasty change made last night did have that impact and it would be plainly ludicrous for this Parliament to continue with that situation. As a result of the discussion that took place between Senator Cook, Senator Durack, Senator Macklin and me this morning, a proposal was agreed which has been subsequently translated into the amendment that now comes from the Senate. We certainly support the Government's proposal and we look forward to it with interest.

<PARA> (b) Recordings and broadcasts may be made only from Channel 1 on the house monitoring system. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Broadcasts of excerpts shall be used only for the purposes of fair and accurate reports of proceedings, and shall not be used for: (1) political party advertising or election campaigns; (2) satire and ridicule; or (3) commercial sponsorship or commercial advertising. </PARA>

<PARA> (h) The instructions of the Speaker of the House of Representatives or his delegates in respect of the broadcasting of excerpts, which are not inconsistent with these conditions, shall be observed. </PARA>
<PARA>I have drawn attention in recent days in this Parliament to an important element of the last election result, and that is the visible plague on both our houses evidenced in that result. The fact that the Government achieved only 39 3/4 per cent of the primary vote and the Opposition 43 per cent of the primary vote indicates significantly that there is a great deal of disillusionment and disenchantment with the two major parties in the eyes of the electorate. People are justifiably cynical about the standing and performance of politicians in the two major parties. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe a large part of that, an important element of that, has been our performance in this place. It is against that background of our desire to raise parliamentary standards that we bring forward the motion at this time for the televising of Parliament, initially on a trial basis, and hopefully on a more significant and extended basis so that the people of Australia can be the judge of our parliamentary performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is instructive in this regard to draw attention to an opinion poll done by the Morgan Research group which appeared in this week's Bulletin magazine which showed that only 13 per cent of the Australian people believe that we are ethical and honest. In the list we ranked well behind pharmacists, doctors, dentists and school teachers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We even ranked behind television reporters. Noticeably, we did rank somewhat above journalists. The point is that we are held in significant public disregard to a large extent because of our performance in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The electorate wants us to lift our game. The people want to get value for their money. They read today in the newspapers that we are voting ourselves an increase in salary. They want to ensure that they get value for money against the very significant salaries that are paid to people in this House. Electors know that we have got real problems in Australia. They know the magnitude of those problems-they see the vacant shops and failed businesses; they see the data on personal bankruptcies reaching record levels and small to medium sized business failures reaching record levels. They know that high interest rates are a principal cause of that. The people know the magnitude of our balance of payments and debt problems. They want those problems and those issues and the policy solutions associated with them debated in this House. They do not want Members of this House to spend an inordinate amount of their time playing games, acting like a circus and appearing like a bearpit; they want us to get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the best ways to focus the attention of the electorate on the extent to which the parliamentary process has been abused is to open it up for television broadcasting. The people want a degree of professionalism from us that they expect in other aspects of their lives. For example, they want Question Time to actually be Question Time. They want questions asked and want questions answered; they do not want Question Time being used as an opportunity, by way of dorothy dixers, to tip buckets on the Opposition. They want to see Ministers stand up and do their jobs. They want to expose those Ministers when they cannot do their jobs; when they cannot answer those questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the public also expect that matters of public importance and other motions will be seriously debated in this House, not in circumstances where the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or the Treasurer (Mr Keating) leave the Parliament, leaving the defence of their Government and its performance to some new or lower level backbencher rather than taking the debate themselves. While people in the gallery might be impressed on occasions by the performance of key Government Ministers and the erudite way in which they heap buckets of abuse on us, and while they might be impressed that the Treasurer calls the manufacturing sector in Australia a spittoon, the people of Australia will not be impressed by that sort of behaviour. They will not be impressed by Ministers who are visibly not doing their jobs in Question Time, in more general debates, in matters of public importance, in ministerial statements, in Opposition responses, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia would also be dead unimpressed with the extent to which legislation is mishandled in this place; the extent to which legislation is guillotined through this Parliament, as it was recently. We offered to come back for an extra week and to spend the time doing the job. But no, 34 Bills were rammed through this place in a day and a half. Many of those Bills will be full of errors because they have not had sufficient time spent on them for scrutiny and examination. That would be clearly exposed by the televising of Parliament to the people of Australia. They could monitor the attendance of some of us. They could monitor the extent to which we represent our electorates and a host of other ways in which they find it difficult to get a handle on our performance at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> So I put it to honourable members that today there is a very important and urgent need to provide the people of Australia with the opportunity to be the direct judges of our parliamentary performance. I was interested in an interview on the World Today at lunchtime with Mr Austin Mitchell, a Labour member of parliament who is chairman of the all-party committee on televising parliament in Britain. He concluded, after a number of remarks, that parliamentarians tended to take a more active interest in their job, and visibly so. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we are actually more influential because governments don't actually listen to words, they listen to the people. </PARA>
<PARA>The people will have the opportunity to monitor our performance openly and directly if we expose ourselves to the scrutiny of television by opening this House and its proceedings to televising on a trial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday evening in the Senate, a motion was successfully passed to offer the opportunity for the televising of Senate Question Time on a trial basis. This provides a very important opportunity for us to issue a challenge to the Prime Minister and the Government in respect to the lower House to match that opportunity that has been provided in the Senate. It is a very important issue which is on the minds of many people in Australia at the present time. I urge the Government to take up the opportunity that has been provided by the lead shown in the Senate yesterday, to match it in the lower House, at least in the August sitting, as a trial move and hopefully to then extend that procedure right across all parliamentary proceedings in an unlimited way. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a new idea. There has been a lot of support for it over the years. A joint committee of the Parliament has supported it. I gather that both Presiding Officers of the Parliament have indicated that they would approve a trial period. Our coalition party room has certainly approved it on a trial basis. I have heard, and I understand, that at least an early review of it by the Caucus approved it. The key question is: why has it not happened? What does the Government have to hide? Who is it that does not want the Parliament to be exposed to public scrutiny?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. On this ninth day of sitting of the House of Representatives over a seven-month period-the first seven months of a new decade-I want to say that here is one chance for the Government to get it right and to agree to this motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to facilitate on a trial basis televising the proceedings of the House of Representatives. In so doing, it is a chance for the Government to make a quantum leap forward in this unfolding battle for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to be the next leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Federal Government. We realise that this battle is now well and truly under way. While the Treasurer is in Paris, the Government has a great opportunity to make a bold decision to approve on a trial basis the televising of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberal and National parties totally support this. In saying that, let me point out we are not dancing to the agenda of certain elements of the media in this place. Indeed, the agenda we are dancing to is the agenda of the people to lift the standards of this Parliament. As the Leader of the Opposition has made very clear indeed, that is the objective and that is what he is determined to do. I must give full credit to the Leader of the Opposition. He has made a great deal of progress along that path and has got little credit for it. And he deserves a great deal more credit for it across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular motion we are saying that it is the people's agenda to have the right to have synchronised televising of the proceedings of the House of Representatives in a sensible, constructive way. After all, they have put $50m of their taxpayers' money into the equipment of this Parliament in that magnificent sound and vision centre, which is down in the basement. I commend members to go down and, first of all, try to find where it is. They will be doing very well if they do that without a guide. When they do, they should make arrangements beforehand because security is quite appropriately strong around that particular part of the building. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a long term supporter of this concept. In the New South Wales State Parliament I advocated the televising of that place. It annoys me intensely that it was agreed to and there is just one little mock camera way up in the top of the VIP gallery in the oldest parliamentary institution in Australia, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly in Macquarie Street. </PARA>

The answer that has been given is that the Government and the parliamentary Labor Party will be considering it over this recess period with a view to arriving at a resolution on the matter in the Budget session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has been pointed out, this House has sat for nine days this year. In the normal course of events these things are handled sensibly between the parties and in the party rooms before a conclusion is reached. Until this last fortnight, the last piece of advice we had from the Opposition on this matter was a deliberation in its party room towards the end of last year in which it said that Parliament should not be televised. We now have the Opposition's fresh view-the view after the election that it wishes Parliament to be televised. Its last piece of advice was that it wished it not to be televised. I think that any reasonable set of human beings would say that, having had that advice from the Opposition and not taking the point any further, we could be permitted a week or two to analyse the new position of the Opposition on the broadcasting of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not prepared to give the Government that period of time. The Opposition wants an opportunity to grandstand in this place and put its proposals through, clothing itself in the sort of unctuous nonsense about wishing to raise parliamentary standards. That is not an impressive start, I would have thought. If it is the case that the Opposition wants a bit more bipartisanship, a bit of give and take across the Parliament, I would have thought-having decided to change its advice to the Government-that it was inappropriate for the Opposition to say that the Government must immediately heed its advice and agree to it in Parliament. Things do not quite operate like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am reluctant to do so as I rarely raise points of order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members indicated it to themselves and we got to hear about it. They did not indicate it to the Government but they indicated it to themselves and we happened to hear from their party room that that was the position they had arrived at. That is fine: we take our information whatever way we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason this proposal is before us now is that the Opposition is subject to pressure. The Opposition has discovered that a section of the Press Gallery, quite reasonably pursuing the interests of its section of the electronic media, feels it would be helpful for it to be able to get access to excerpts of Question Time for the purpose of broadcasts on the nightly news. That is not an ignoble objective. It may indeed be an objective that ultimately the Government comes to agree with. </PARA>
<PARA> But what those people are concerned not to do is to provide an opportunity for people to see the whole functioning of Parliament throughout our daily toil. Why do they not want to provide that? I am afraid the answer is that, no matter what the Opposition may say about a requirement for us to up standards in this place and provide a spectacle that people will find elevating, uplifting and informative, on the whole people will choose not to watch it. On the whole, they will take the view, as they have with the radio broadcasts of Parliament, that this is a piece of advice during the day on the conduct of government, a spectacle that they will feel themselves not in the least bit deprived of if they do not see it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be honest about the pressures that come on us in this place. No evidence has been presented that there is a massive public demand for televising Parliament. There is a substantial demand above us in the Gallery that there ought to be a televising of Parliament, or excerpts of it, but there is no evidence to suggest that there is any public demand. We have only the evidence of what happens on radio broadcasts, and that is that we get a very paltry audience. If people are going to vote with their ears-the number of ears than can be counted listening in to our broadcast at any time-we will have to say that those who want access to broadcasting of Parliament either by radio or television represent a very small proportion of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not get round to this point that we ought to consider the subject of broadcasting because there is a massive upsurge of democratic opinion swelling and rolling across Lake Burley Griffin towards us; there is a picket being conducted outside Parliament House demanding that people be allowed to listen to us and, above all, see us. There is no such argument taking place in the public. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are into here is the opportunity for a bit of self-indulgence and a bit of playing to the Gallery on our part. That is what we are being invited to do. In our view, that is not a sufficient reason to hurry consideration of this proposal through the Parliament at this point. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) presented his argument he went through a plethora of accusations about what is done in the Parliament, with the implication than if Parliament is broadcast there will be absolutely terrific management of the economy; if Parliament is broadcast, all of a sudden people's behaviour will change dramatically; and if Parliament is broadcast there is going to be cure-all to all the great issues of public debate today. Basically those were the sorts of claims that he put forward. Those are, to say the least, tendentious opinions. </PARA>
<PARA> If we could all say that perfect management of the economy would result from the broadcast of Parliament, we could well find ourselves adopting this proposal with alacrity. Indeed, if this fact had become generally known, I dare say we would have been sprinting into this place to put this matter to a vote as quickly as possible. However, rational analysis would suggest that that is most unlikely to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we might get a guarantee from the Leader of the Opposition that if Parliament is broadcast we will not in future get questions about the operations on Ministers, questions about whether or not Ministers are under death threats-that was the sort of question that was asked the other day-for the purpose of elevating Parliament and this chamber and making sure that all the great national public issues of the day are being properly considered in this place. Do we think that if we broadcast Parliament such questions would cease in Question Time? I suspect not. </PARA>
<PARA> When these matters have been debated in the past, generally there has been a section of the Parliament which has held the view that what is likely to happen is that everything in Parliament will become set piece; that there will be set piece opportunities for debate in which Parliament is treated simply as a sounding board and not a deliberative chamber that is fine. That is as least as likely an outcome. I do not think that anybody who has analysed the speeches of Parliament-as I did when I was a student of history and politics-could say that there was not a substantial change in style in the way in which matters were deliberated in this place after radio broadcasting compared with those prior to broadcasting. One cannot say whether it was due to that directly. </PARA>
<PARA> There are enough issues here, having received new advice on the matter from the Opposition as to its attitude in the last fortnight, for us to want to consider that in some more detail before arriving at our conclusions. Our conclusion to this point is that we have an open mind on it and we wish to deliberate further, but not at this time. Therefore, we do not believe that it is justified to suspend the Standing Orders in order to bring this matter to a conclusion now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when I was speaking to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2), which amend the Broadcasting Act, I said that the revision in the form of those two Bills is really the forerunner to the broader review of the Broadcasting Act which the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has outlined and upon which discussion will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think this legislation arises from the state of confusion about the economic viability of much of our broadcast industry. These two Bills reflect that concern in the public interest provision and in their recognition of the need for proper constraints on the role of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). There is to be a streamlining of those provisions that have not worked adequately and a removal, at least in part, of some of the backlog that has occurred within the Broadcasting Tribunal's activities. As I said last night before we moved on to other matters, the issues concerning the worth of the public interest and the desire of the community to encourage a viable Australian broadcasting industry are paramount to what lies behind these Bills and the broader review that will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated last night, reference was made earlier in the debate to the question of limits on foreign ownership. There is no doubt that in the general community there is great concern about the need to encourage real Australian involvement, participation and equity right through the industry. The problem should not be put solely at the feet of the Government. Some would suggest that, in view of the problems of the entrepreneurs in the business, the Government should be forced into bailing them out following their excesses and actions which have not been condoned or in any way encouraged by the Government. If one talks to people, as members of parliament do-I certainly talk to the people of my electorate of Parramatta-one finds that they are concerned to ensure that we preserve our television industry and our television productions. Because of problems in the radio industry it is just as important that we preserve the effective operation of the broadcast industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the measures contained in the two Bills which streamline the ABT and remove some of its unnecessary powers are desirable and set a framework for positive change and positive steps towards the review that will come forward as part of a broader package later in the year. I commend the Government, and the Minister in particular, for having the foresight and the courage to proceed with that broader review. A lot of concern has been expressed about the ownership question, the economic viability of the relative operators and so forth. I commend the Government for its fortitude in proceeding to preserve our industry. The people in the industry-as opposed to a few entrepreneurs-want to get back to a level playing field. They want a more balanced approach and they want the public interest to be properly preserved and maintained. I believe that this legislation sets the scene for that to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation changes the share transaction approval process. The change in the definition of `prescribed interest' will free up the role of the ABT where it is appropriate to do that. The extension of the maximum period for the licence arrangements allows more flexibility so that the Tribunal's role is clearly defined, much of the backlog is removed and much of the typing up of matters before the Tribunal-something the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to last night-will cease. All people who have an interest in this field-particularly the various consumer organisations, unions and so forth-take the view that changes of this sort are positive changes. They recognise that some of the regulations have been allowed to tie up the process too tightly and have therefore created the backlogs that were referred to by the right honourable member for New England. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation redresses many of the broadcast policy decisions of the last decade or so. The 1981 provisions in particular were objected to by many people when they were introduced. It was felt that those provisions were creating problems that should have been addressed more adequately by the then Fraser Government. At least now we have taken a very positive and tangible step to ensure that that situation can be remedied. The provisions outlined in the Bill and in the Minister's second reading speech represent perhaps only an interim step in that change, but I think it is a very positive and constructive one. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that, for the people who live in areas such as the electorates in western Sydney, the changes that are contained in this legislation will be important because they will give the people the right and the opportunity to contribute positively to licence renewal questions which are of great concern. As with a number of other areas, we need more information and more public dissemination of material through the broadcasting system to ensure that community needs are met. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation, radio stations such as 2WS in western Sydney, which I mentioned last night, will be able to have their needs properly addressed as part of the broader review. This legislation starts the process rolling in a very constructive way. I acknowledge the Minister's commitment that he has outlined on a number of occasions, and I know that the Government's agenda for that whole process of change-in particular the decision that has been taken on the 20 per cent foreign ownership provision-is in the collective interest of not only the community in my area but also all of those people who have concern for the diversity and the dynamics of the Australian broadcasting industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation should be taken on board and warmly acknowledged by all. It should be seen as a very positive step for those people who obtain their livelihoods from the industry and who at the same time are a part-and indeed proud to be a part-of ensuring that the democratic process is furthered by an adequate and proper broadcast policy which encourages the dynamics, encourages change and is flexible enough to allow the ABT to encourage and permit change. At the same time, the legislation ensures that the Australian national interest is fully honoured and enhanced. That has been the clear objective of the Government, and I am very pleased to lend my strong support to the Bills before the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member opposite for advising me where I might sit or might not sit. I am quite happy to stand where I am at this present stage. I commend the contributions made by the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott). I found the rebuttal of the arguments put forward by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), by the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Chifley-notwithstanding the contributions made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow)-to quite succinctly put to rest the concerns which have been raised by the honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for New England.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sort of attack which was made upon the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) by the right honourable member for New England was not necessary-indeed, it was misplaced. In the context of the contribution made by the honourable member for Menzies, I would like to address in some further detail some of the questions which he raised during the course of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing needs to be made clear about the Broadcasting Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2). Together, those Bills provide for much more efficient and effective regulation. I know that the honourable member for Menzies in the course of the debate yesterday admitted that he thought there were many aspects of this legislation that he supported. However, I was a bit amazed with the amendment relating to the first piece of legislation, which in my view sells short the legislation rather dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA> What he ought to understand is that the first Bill gives the ABT effective remedies as an alternative to licence revocation. It appears that the Opposition would do nothing about this situation, so that if the licensee was manifestly unsuitable the ABT would have the opportunity of doing nothing about it or deprive viewers of their services by depriving the licensee of his or her licence. To me, that-not the legislation which is before the Parliament-seems to be draconian. </PARA>
<PARA> He has argued that the Bill is draconian and gives unnecessary powers. But he cannot be arguing that the ABT should have lesser powers. Surely he is not arguing that the ABT should not have some discretionary powers that, for example, it should be able to order remedial action or to give protective directions or order divestment. Is he saying that there ought to be two alternatives: nothing or revocation? I do not believe that that is in the best interests of the Australian broadcasting industry and it is certainly not a position which is supported by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Efficiency is the key to the second Bill. That is acknowledged by the Opposition and it removes unnecessary red tape and paper work. Its measures will save the ABT and investors much time and money and allow the ABT to focus on important issues such as control. Even the Opposition concedes that that is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies said that yesterday. I think it is important that we see, as the honourable member for Parramatta quite rightly pointed out, the impact that this will have on the services which are undertaken by the ABT. It seems to me that this will allow the ABT to address itself to important licensing matters and share transactions that may have a substantive impact on the broadcasting community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill is also essential in maintaining the current services to the public. It allows the continuation of legitimate networking arrangements that keep existing metropolitan and regional services on the air. It will allow more regional viewers to receive the same services as metropolitan viewers. The honourable member for Capricornia said to me yesterday and, as have a number of people who have spoken in this debate, pointed out the advantages that this legislation has brought to regional viewers. Those advantages should not be discounted. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out the dramatic advantages that aggregation has provided for the constituents in his electorate. I am looking forward to the impact of equalisation in some areas of regional Australia. I find the criticisms which are made of the legislation by the Opposition in this context again to be misplaced. I do not believe it understands the contents of the legislation or the importance of the moves being put in place by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are provisions in the No. 2 Bill which provide exemptions for the breach of the 60 per cent metropolitan reach television limit and associated cross media limits which might arise as an incidental result of program supply under television networking agreements. Related provisions in the Bill ensure that special ABT approval is not required under section 89a of the Act as a result of the radio or television program supply agreement or agreements between licensees and copyright collection agencies. These amendments have been drafted in response to advice given by the Solicitor-General to the ABT. Before that advice was provided, the ABT had administered the Broadcasting Act on the basis that legitimate program arrangements would not constitute control for the purposes of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABT has not required essential approval under section 89a to participate in the benefits of relevant affiliated licences. The Opposition has moved to strike out all provisions in the Bill which provide exemptions from program supply arrangements. A closer analysis of the claims made by the Opposition reveals fundamental misconceptions about the nature of the proposed amendments. The Opposition has claimed, for example, that the networking amendments are not necessary. The amendments, in fact, are needed to remove serious legal doubt about existing network arrangements to metropolitan areas and the extension of commercial television services to regional areas under the equalisation program. The 60 per cent reach limit prevents common ownership or control of commercial television licences in each metropolitan area in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the Opposition, the Government is not prepared to jeopardise the continuance of existing networking arrangements to affiliate in metropolitan areas such as Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. The Government is also not prepared to jeopardise the continued extension of regional television services under the aggregation program. The Opposition has argued that the networking exemptions have made the 60 per cent reach limit obsolete. The provisions do not, however, provide a blanket extension to networking licensees in terms of any control which can be exercised other than as an incidental result of the supply of programs to a metropolitan regional licensee. Nor do they allow network licensees to own additional metropolitan or regional stations in excess of the 60 per cent limit. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemptions in this Bill would also not apply to any control exercised by a network supplier over the amount of local or other non-network programming which could be broadcast by the regional licensee. The rights of a regional licensee to make independent decisions on programming policy are not restricted by any provisions in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has also claimed that the networking amendments would remove the ABT supervision of networking arrangements to prevent exploitation of regional licensees. The ABT has power to examine and take action against any exploitation of any regional licensees through networking in particular through its licence condition and renewal powers. The requirement in the Bill that television networking agreements be in writing and lodged with the ABT will provide a basis for ABT examination of any powers of control which might be exercised by a network supplier, other than as an incidental result of the supply of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to impose an additional regulatory burden as proposed by the Opposition for every networking agreement to receive prior ABT approval through a formal inquiry process. This Opposition proposal is entirely inconsistent with its complaints that the ABT is being given too many regulatory powers at a time when those powers should be reduced. I suggest to the honourable member for Menzies that if he had examined the position which the Opposition has been adopting, he would note that inconsistency. The Opposition has expressed concern, and the honourable member for Menzies did it in the course of his contribution yesterday, about the effect of amendments on a court action in the Federal Court. As already indicated, these amendments are necessary so that the existing network arrangements in metropolitan areas can continue and additional commercial television services can be offered to regional viewers. Litigation should not be used as an excuse to prevent the Parliament resolving uncertainties in the law in a way that simply confirms longstanding Government policy. It is appropriate that this legislation should contain these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies sought an assurance on the issue of foreign ownership. The Government's position needs to be understood very clearly. It is time to dispel some of the myths that have surrounded this issue. I just put the issue in context. The Australian Labor Party's policy has been very clear and concise. The issue has been addressed in the legislation since 1956. The present moves being made address, by and large, those changes made in the legislation by the Opposition in 1981. Those amendments allowed foreign investors to hold an aggregate up to and including 50 per cent of a holding company of an Australian broadcasting licensee provided no foreign individual acquired actual control or had more than a 15 per cent direct or indirect deemed control in the licensee. This allows very high levels of foreign interest in Australian broadcasters to be achieved through various contrived schemes. This proposal will introduce proportional tracing of interests for the purpose of determining the aggregate level of foreign interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This method of tracing deems a personal company which holds a proportion of the shares of another company with broadcasting interests, either directly as a licensee or indirectly through another company with direct or indirect interests in a licensee, to hold a similar proportion of that other company's broadcasting interests. For example, company A, which owns 50 per cent of the shares in company B which owns 100 per cent of licensee C, is deemed to have a 50 per cent interest in the licensee, 50 per cent of 100 per cent of licensee C. This will ensure that interests held in holding companies or in remote companies are counted in determining the aggregate levels of foreign interest. I stress that the Bill will still outlaw any arrangement, including loan arrangements, which give actual control to a foreign person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be no allowance above 20 per cent; it is very clear. The right honourable member for New England commented upon reporting arrangements unnecessary for changes in control and said that we should not have to report changes in management and should not have to report automatically every three months. The Opposition has not understood these provisions. The Bill provides that there is no need to report changes in management and also that there is no need to report if there is no change in control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We did not hear any comment from the honourable member for Menzies on one aspect of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1990. It seems to me that the Opposition, in taking the position it has done on the Bill, has caused some angst among some public broadcasting licensees. One proposed amendment to the first piece of legislation to which, as I understand it, the Opposition is opposed, provides for ease-up arrangements in terms of broadcasting sponsorship announcements in accordance with the rules applying to public broadcasters. I am, and have been in the past, associated with a couple of public broadcasters. I have found difficulty with this question. I may be wrong-and if I am I invite the honourable member for Menzies to indicate that I am-but I understood that the Opposition is opposing this Bill, not just sections of the Bill. I am happy to be corrected if that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that this issue be clarified so that people in the public broadcasting domain know what they are able to do and know the limits to which they are able to go in terms of licensing arrangements. It is also important that they understand what associations they can have with sponsoring bodies and that they undertake public broadcasting announcements in such a way that provides them with the ability to provide community promotional material as well as making sponsorship announcements which are not advertising. </PARA>
<PARA> In toto, these Bills provide for far more efficiency and effective regulatory control, as I said initially. We are aware of the Opposition's position in relation to what it refers to as the nightmarish aspects of the legislation-and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) acknowledged, it is regarded as nightmarish. But the review process is in place, and the honourable member for Menzies knows that it is in place. He also understands the difficulties which arise in these areas, and he ought to accept the Government's good faith in this area and realise that we are about providing a far more effective and efficient broadcasting service here in Australia and, as he has already acknowledged in the debate, the provisions in this legislation go a large way towards that end. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of foreign ownership, I clarify for the benefit of the honourable member for Menzies that it is possible for a person to hold loan interests of more than 20 per cent of the total financial interest in a licence, providing, as I stressed previously, actual control does not arise. The 20 per cent limit will be on ownership interest in shares, and I am sure that the honourable member for Menzies understands that. Perhaps he can get clarification later. I was clarifying the issue of ownership. </PARA>

<PARA> I am sure all will agree that this debate has been one in which we have seen a range of issues addressed. I think the contributions that have been made by members on both sides of the House have added to the substance of the debate. I recommend to the honourable member for Menzies that he rethink his amendments on the issue of networking, which will be opposed by the Government, and that he also rethink his amendments to the first Bill. I believe they do not add anything to the debate and, indeed, would derogate quite substantially from the intent of the legislation. </PARA>

The problem is the dividing line between advertisements and community announcements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not normal to talk on clauses of this sort in a committee stage, but I did want to on this occasion in any event simply to draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that under clause 2 some of the contentious provisions in this Bill will commence to operate on the day on which the Act receives the royal assent. If we are right in what we say-and it seems to be common ground now since we heard what the representative of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), has had to say-the axe will fall on this litigation that I referred to yesterday. It is wise for us to remember and to note that, because of clause 2 and the coming into operation of the Act, it really will be sudden death if this Bill is passed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Secretary, representing the Minister, gave the Government's answer to this point. As I understood it, he said, `Well, they are really just using these proceedings in the Federal Court as an excuse. We have this lofty mission we are about here to reform the whole world overnight through this broadcasting Bill and we are not going to let any litigation stand in our way'. That is one way of putting it, but we would say to the Government that that is not the right way to put it; it is not the way the Government really should put it. What the Government should do is say, `There are proceedings on foot in the Federal Court. They concern people's rights, they are being taken on the law as it now is and that should be allowed to go ahead'. Once governments start this shifty, tricky business of seeing people assert their rights in the courts and then saying, `Right, we will fix you quick smart, we will change the law, bring it into operation quickly so that your rights are wiped out', then we really are going down a very rocky road and that is why we complain about what the Government is doing in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just, as I understand it, that some people have been engaging in time stalling activities or frustrating otherwise legitimate activities by bringing a case in the court; it is not really that at all. What must be understood-I referred to this briefly yesterday-is that the Minister's Department gave the Minister some advice on what should be contained in this Bill. That advice actually refers to the court proceedings. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Darling Downs TV have instigated legal action against the Commonwealth, the ABT and the 7 Network. Details are not available at the time of writing but-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the part that should be emphasised-</PARA>
<PARA>it is expected that it will claim that 7's affiliation agreements are illegal through breach of 60 per cent reach limit. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only, therefore, was the existence of the court action so much in the Government's mind that it referred to it in the advice that was given to the Minister but, in fact, the advice turned out to be right; that is to say, the regional television stations concerned in this matter did, in fact, claim that seven's affiliation agreements were illegal through breach of the 60 per cent audience reach limit. They did, in fact, claim that. That is what they started to claim. The Government went off to the court and tried to strike out the statement of claim and, as is often the case these days when this Government goes to the courts, it came a cropper and lost and that summons, as I understand it, was struck out. So the case is still on foot. </PARA>
<PARA> People have rights, these companies have rights, the shareholders have rights and the viewers in regional areas, whom they are above all concerned with, have rights also. What is being done here is a frustration of those rights by this lethal, brutal means of simply legislating immediately, making the Bill come into operation on the day it receives the royal assent and saying, `Well, that is the end of your court case, isn't it? Bad luck; you lost because we happen to have the numbers in the Parliament and we changed the law while you were in the court. Bad luck for you'. That may well be the result of it for all I know, but it is not something the Government should be very happy about; it is nothing it should claim credit for, and it is not a thing that we would allow to go by without some challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> We reject totally the argument advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary, which was that these amendments are necessary, they must be done now, and that the Government would not allow the litigation to be used as an excuse, as it said, for frustrating its program. As I have already said, we take the view that there are some pretty significant principles involved here and the Government is riding roughshod over them. I say that with respect to this clause because, as I have said, clause 2 provides that the contentious parts of the Bill will come into operation when the Bill receives the royal assent. So that will be pretty sudden death. As things have turned out, it is bad luck for the Government-the case might come on before this Bill gets through the Senate, then the Government will have a problem on its hands, will it not, with all its fiddling around. We will see what happens as things go down the track. But that does not affect the principle, which is a significant one, and its breach of it by the Government in this case is a bad one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is opposing clause 4 of the Bill. This clause has one matter that we wish to draw attention to. It contains the following definition of `networking agreement':</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>`networking agreement' means a written agreement lodged with the Tribunal that provides for the supply of programs to the holder of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the network agreement is the arrangement made between the networks and the regional stations under which the networks provide the regional stations with programs, some of their programs, or many of their programs, as the case may be. This is just a clause which has a definition in it, but a lot turns on this single clause because it is the network agreement defined there which will determine the consequences that we say will flow from the other and later clauses of the Bill that we will refer to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition refers to a written agreement lodged with the Tribunal. Does this mean that a networking agreement, no matter how inimical it may be to the interests of regional stations, need only be lodged with the Tribunal and not approved by it? This is important because-the Parliamentary Secretary made some reference to this before-under section 89a of the Act the law presently provides that a licensee may admit another person to participate in any of the benefits of the licence or to exercise any of the powers or authorities granted by the licence. The Parliamentary Secretary has quite rightly said that the Sol icitor-General has given an opinion, which would seem to be correct, to the eff ect that when a network allows the regional stations to have access to its prog rams the regional stations are drawing some benefits from that licence. That is  therefore a situation that comes within section 89a. </PARA>
<PARA>  The licensee, therefore, in that case described in section 89a may allow another person to participate in the benefits of his licence but-and it is a big but-it can be done only with the consent in writing of the Tribunal. Not only does section 89a say that it must be done with the consent of the Tribunal but it goes on to say that without that consent it may not be done. The draftsmen of this Act regarded that as very important. The draftsmen of the Broadcasting Act were not prepared to stand by and allow regional stations to be dominated by the networks. They wanted to keep, as I understand it, a supervisory role over the activities of the network arrangements and agreements which is now being negated by the various provisions that we are looking at at the moment. As I have said, one of them hinges around this definition of networking agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> We should take the case where a networking agreement is put up by a network to one of the regional stations. It really is very inimical to the interests of the regional station and to the interests of regional viewers. Say, for instance, that it says that there is to be no news provided other than the news provided by the network. That is a very undesirable sort of agreement. Are we to understand that because the Tribunal has to have the agreement only lodged and not approved that that is allowed to go ahead now? If it is-our understanding is that that is the case-that is a very undesirable thing and could be a major step towards making the regional television stations slaves of the networks. That would be very undesirable. If it does mean that the only requirement is to have the network agreement lodged, but not necessarily approved, by the Tribunal, that is clearly a negation of section 89a which says that presently that set-up cannot occur without the consent of the Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Normally, as the Parliamentary Secretary quite rightly said, we would want to see less regulation in this area, not more. This particular point goes to a very fundamental thing. Are we going to have viable regional stations providing services to their viewers which are of regional and local interest? Are we going to have that or not? In the context of this clause, which sets out the definition of a networking agreement, are we right in our understanding? We will vote against this unless we are persuaded very clearly to the contrary that what I have been putting is not correct. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that I am able to specifically answer the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) on that point, other than to say that my understanding of the Act and its general intent-I might refer him to the definition of control on page 5 of the second reading speech as it relates to the general Bill-is that it is considered desirable for the Act to give clear guidance to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and to the licensees on the meaning of the term `control'. That may in some part relate to ownership. It may in other parts relate to the other point that I think he has to take account of. The honourable member has said that he needs to be convinced before agreeing to support these proposals. One needs to look at the actual capacity to exercise control of a commercial licence either through control of the licensee company or through `control over programming or other broadcasting operations'. I think it is very clear from the second reading speech that it is the clear intention of the Government that the Broadcasting Tribunal will have the capacity to exercise judgment over these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we talk in terms of a networking agreement being required to be lodged in writing, as I understand it that means that the Broadcasting Tribunal has to be presented with the basis on which there is a relationship between one of the regional stations and the network. Let me take this a little further. In 1987 when the Government commenced the process of aggregation and set in mind the principles that it wanted carried through, including issues of audience reach and including the process by which it would occur, it was uppermost in our mind that we would not have a situation where the regional stations would simple become the supplicants of one or other of the major networks. There were very clear indications that this would not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening during the process of aggregation-I might say that I think there is a very strong case for the Government to do exactly what is happening with this legislation to hurry up this process-and what was clearly put in place at the time were delaying provisions that allowed all the players to work out their relative positions and to negotiate through their relationships. They are now being expected to provide in writing to the Tribunal the basis on which they formed those relationships. I remember at the time in 1987 that I was quite concerned about the unnecessary haste in this area. I think in the end the Government took the right decision by enabling a five-year time frame. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the whole process of aggregation and the development of these relationships with the networks involved decisions not only about program delivery, ownership and divesting but also about the capital equipment required to bring about the desired result. If I remember correctly at the time there was about $800m worth of imported capital equipment required to bring about the overall plan of rural aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the timeframes that have been allowed have enabled a shift in that position so that there has been an opportunity for Australian companies to become involved in that process, including the supply of equipment. It has also given us time-I think it was a correct decision of the Government at the time-to provide the time line. Not only have we been able to provide that opportunity for Australian companies to become involved in the supply of equipment but also people right across the industry have been given time to see the way that it might take shape and to form their various relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, with the requirement that networking agreements be lodged with the Tribunal, is part of that process. I say to the honourable member for Menzies that, from my own experience of living in central Victoria, where we have one commercial station, Channel 8 Bendigo, and the ABC, the interim period of the process has been less than satisfactory for regional viewers. The various things that have taken place between owners of stations and their relationships have meant that the choice of programs that we got in the first instance tends now to have been overcome by the dominance of one of the major players over the programs that would be delivered to that regional station. </PARA>
<PARA> I get many comments from people who tell me that Channel 8 is not as good as it used to be. What they are looking for is the choice of program and they are looking for the breaking down of the very agreements that seem to have been formed during this process. What I am looking for from this hurrying up of the broader aggregation process that is embodied in this legislation and the laying on the table of these networking agreements is in fact the flushing out of what has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose I can say, if it is any assurance, that the motivation behind the introduction of these proposals is a hurrying along of the process so that there will be a proper choice for country viewers. The forcing of these networks to lay in written form on the table in front of the Tribunal the basis of their agreements is part of that process, but it has to be seen in the general context of the broad definition of control and responsibility that lies within the Tribunal. As I said earlier in my contribution, this debate is to look at issues of control as they relate not only to share transactions and licensees but also to control over programming or other broadcasting operations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not a case for those proposed amendments to be taken into account here. I do not think there is a need for the Opposition to oppose the proposals, and I would suggest that the legislation as proposed by the Government ought to be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be appropriate if I make this brief comment at this stage so that the Parliamentary Secretary (Mr Snowdon) may be able to reply to it. The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who has just spoken, made a very interesting contribution. It seemed to revolve around the fact that these networking agreements, lodged with the Tribunal, will be public documents; they will all be seen and open. That seemed to be the linchpin of what he was putting-so that we can all see what the deal is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply do not know, I must admit one way or the other, but the essence of what the honourable member was saying was that the documents would be laid on the table and therefore would be public and open. I simply ask whether the Parliamentary Secretary in his reply might be able to throw some light on whether they will be public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will attempt to shed a bit of light on the concerns of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). The first thing I would say is that agreements will be laid on the table of the Tribunal. The issue of whether or not they become public is a question to be addressed by the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It ought to be made very clear that he is right and that there is no need for the prior approval of the networking agreements by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) under these arrangements. But there are no exemptions provided under the Act if control by network suppliers goes beyond the control levels which might be said to exist as an incidental result of program supply. That needs to be made very clear. Under the example cited by the honourable member for Menzies-where there was no local news services-that would not be exempted under the control provisions of the Act, and the ABT could take remedial action. It ought to be also made clear that the ABT can take evidence from the networking agreement into account as part of any inquiry into the exercising of license conditions and renewal powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that I have clarified those points which were raised by the honourable member for Menzies. I emphasise again that the ABT has the power to examine any powers of control which might be exercised by a network supplier under these proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 6, pages 3 and 4, omit proposed subsections 89a (14) and (15). </PARA>
<PARA> By way of introduction, I say that this follows on from clause 4 that we have just been discussing: namely, the definition of network agreements. We now come to clause 6 which tells us in proposed subsections (14) and (15) that where under one of those network agreements programs are supplied to the holder of a commercial licence by a party to the agreement, and the party `is not taken to be admitted by the holder to participate in any of the benefits of the licence' in circumstances in which I will come to in a moment. The consequence of that is that if one is brought within the definition of networking agreement and where there is a situation where programs are supplied to the holder of a licence by a party to the agreement then one is not to be taken to have been admitted to participate in any of the benefits of the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> One might well ask: what follows from that? What follows from that is that one does not come within section 89a, and that means that consent does not have to be obtained by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. We have already seen when we looked at the earlier clause that the Tribunal must give its consent before any other person is allowed to participate in the benefits of a licence which would be done under a networking agreement, as we understand it.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to go over a couple of these points because I must say they are not entirely clear. One particular point which has been made by the Parliament Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is that the networking agreements will be laid on the table of the Broadcasting Tribunal but not necessarily made public. I am not quite sure what that means. If they are laid on the table, is one allowed to go up to the table and have a look at them; or is it going to be a matter for the Tribunal to say, `No. You are not allowed to have a look at them.'? It may say, `This is ``commercial-in-confidence'' ' or there may be some other restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that this is not a trick question. I simply do not know. It seems to be one of the linchpins of the whole thing. If the networking agreements are public a lot of people will be better informed on the arrangements. That may or may not be desirable. At the very least, so that we can get a working knowledge of the consequences of what the Government is proposing, we should know. It really is very important. I also said that it was only in a certain number of cases that a person would be exempted from, in effect, getting the approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to one of these networking agreements. That is where, we are told, to put it in different words, that a person is not to be taken to be admitted to any of the benefits of the licence just because-and three circumstances are set out:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the terms of the agreement that relate to the supply of the programs, or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a business relationship created by those terms, or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the dependence of the holder on that supply for the provision of the service under the licence. </PARA>
<PARA>It may well be-I do not know-that the example I gave before was a bit extreme. Perhaps it was; but extreme examples make the point. I made the point of an agreement where the network says, `Under the agreement you will have no local news; we will provide the news for you which will be of great benefit to you'. That may be too extreme an example. But there may be a lot of other cases where the network is in a position where it can dominate the regional station. It may dictate the programs. It may say, `You must take all of our programs'. It may be that the stage is reached where the network agreement is, say, No. 3 in a line of three and the regional station does not have much choice because, if it does not take what is offered by the network, a full range of programs will not be able to be shown on the regional station. I would have thought that that was a danger. </PARA>
<PARA> Seeing the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) reminds me of something I wanted to say, and I may as well say it now. Yesterday he very rightly spoke about the importance of having local community news, community information and matters of interest to the local community. The honourable member was saying that it was important for the local community, the regional and rural community, to have, as it were, its own station reflecting its own local sentiment. We keep asking: is the Government not going contrary to that by what it is doing here? The Government is taking away-there has been no denial of this, so we are presumably right-the power of the Broadcasting Tribunal to say no. The Government is taking away the power of the Tribunal to say, `We do not believe that this is the sort of networking agreement that should be approved. It is too heavy-handed. It gives too much power to the network. It makes the regional station too much of a slave to the network. We will not give our consent to it'. Is that not what the Government is doing here?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is removing the need to get the consent from the Broadcasting Tribunal-which it is; we have been told that the Government is doing so by this proposal-if the Government believes in regionalism and the importance of having viable regional stations putting on programs that people in the local, rural and regional community want to see, is that not an undesirable thing? If the Government is concerned about all of that, why is it doing this? It defies any explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> It reminds me of another point that must be made. I think it was said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications in his reply that the Opposition had been saying that there was no need to change the law. I do not know whether I actually used those words yesterday. We certainly do not maintain that there is no necessity to change the situation, because it would seem that there is. Yesterday I thought we were saying that we think that the way in which the Government is going about it now is very undesirable. I may be wrong in my recollection of that. I will look up the Hansard. Let me make it plain that we are now saying that the Government seems to have come upon a bit of a problem here, but the way to resolve it is not the way the Government is resolving it now. I will just say, for the first time, what was said in the advice given to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) by his Department on the other related matter. The advice said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some steps-</PARA>
<PARA>he was advised-</PARA>
<PARA>could be taken to ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power, local autonomy and programming relevance. The current requirement for ABT approval for participation in the benefits of a licence could be retained to ensure that the Tribunal vets affiliation agreements. Some powers could be given to the Tribunal to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network services. </PARA>
<PARA>Because time is running out-although I might have another go later-I simply ask the question: Why does the Government not follow the advice that the Department gave the Minister? Give the Tribunal some scope for overseeing the situation and prevent the exploitation of the affiliates. Are we wrong about this, or are we right? It is simply that. We would like to hear an explanation. In the absence of one, the Opposition will proceed with its amendments to take these subclauses out of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not really want to deal with the matters that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has raised in detail, simply because I cannot. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) will probably deal with them in more detail because they concern questions relating to advice from the Solicitor-General and other legalities. The point I would make is that we have to draw the line somewhere. There has to be some sort of balance somewhere. If we are to have aggregation as it exists in this region-I do not think any other areas in Australia have this yet-where we have asked the networks to ensure that they are supplying two or three commercial services when one existed before, there has to be some incentive for the networks to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the legal arguments, I think there is an argument that, if the networks have the incentive to provide reasonable television in local areas, we have to balance that to some extent at least with the desirability of having local news. Looking at the local news as it exists in this region-the Canberra, south-eastern region of New South Wales-where we have tried aggregation for the first time in our broadcasting history, I would say that it has not been working too badly. Generally, it seems that in each case of the television station which existed in the area over many years-Prime in Dubbo, Orange, Albury, Wagga; Capital in Canberra, Cooma, Goulburn; and WIN television in Wollongong and down the south-east coast of New South Wales and Goulburn-the long time residents generally watch and depend on the local news on the station which has traditionally been involved in that local area. </PARA>
<PARA> We actually find WIN television winning the news ratings in Wollongong and along the south coast. We actually find Capital winning the news ratings in Canberra and the local area around here and towards Cooma and Bombala and Jindabyne. We would probably find the people who are very interested in the local news doing so on Prime rather than the other two stations in the Dubbo-Orange area. There will be some trend away, depending on the competition and the money that people put into it. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some evidence that the stations have not tried too hard to take news from the existing station. They have tried to provide other competition, but this has not worked particularly well. It is interesting to note in the Canberra sub-region that Prime, which was showing news at a quarter to six, has changed it to six o'clock to compete with the other networks. There is pretty strong evidence that it is catering for local news on all the channels for aggregation. There is also strong evidence that we cannot put undue pressure on them to spend money without its returning a dividend of some sort. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we have to look at aggregation and how it will work in the rest of the country. We intend to provide people throughout the nation with as many alternatives as possible but we must make sure that people have not only variety but also quality. We have to draw a balance somewhere. The honourable member for Menzies has drawn the line differently from the way we would, taking the view that we must provide some incentive for the networks to work towards aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA> In this region aggregation generally has been extremely well received, for instance, in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. There are people who have been able to gain not only new television stations but also a variety in what they watch. For instance, local television stations-let us say WIN-are giving time to towns such as Queanbeyan. It does not have the audience in Canberra, but it will go to Queanbeyan and do a lot more there than perhaps the others, and then people think that WIN is giving them a fair go. Prime was quite well watched in the Bombala area. It may well be that Prime took the trouble to go there because it was interested in Bombala and Jindabyne. It was, to some extent, a commercial decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital has tried to meet that competition. On the coast the regional network which links with the Nine network still has some advantage at the moment. There has to be an acknowledgment that the Nine network is generally a popular network throughout Australia. Along the south-east coast there is a fairly strong identification with Nine. There have been some problems, particularly for Capital and Prime, in getting into those pockets with UHF television. It is much easier for VHF television to reach those areas. That is not because there is any problem with the strength of the signal, but if there is not line of sight-in other words, contact-between the receiver and the transmitting area there are more problems with UHF than with VHF. There are pockets throughout the south-eastern coast where residential areas, because of all the hills, are out of sight of the transmitter. </PARA>
<PARA> Both WIN and Prime are trying to deal with that by providing better services. Both have tried to strengthen their signals through the establishment of a transmitter at Little Forest Trig which is near Milton. This transmitter means that they can strengthen the signals from Mount Wandera and perhaps Brown Mountain, which is between Bega and Cooma. With that link, Prime and Capital will be better competition down the south-east coast. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, most of the popular programs in the Canberra-Dubbo areas are those on the Nine network, although it must be said that every one of the networks has popular programs. Nine just seems to have a predominance of them.</PARA>
<PARA> If we are to maintain choice we must ensure-using our own example-that Prime is economically viable, able to sell advertising and show it has the viewers, and that Capital is economically viable, able to show it has the viewers and can gain advertising-the same as WIN does. This is extremely important because it means that people will continue getting quality television with a maximum of local input, whether sport, news or other programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, once aggregation occurred Capital stopped screening what it called the Local Member segment when five or six members of parliament were able to have a five-minute session at 11.30 or midnight on a Saturday night. </PARA>

<PARA> I wonder whether the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A.

What this Bill does is remove the legal doubt that prior approval could be required while retaining the ABT's power to take remedial action should it be so required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's amendment would require this prior ABT approval, which at present is not required, of all program supply agreements, as well as copyright agency agreements. Obviously this would represent a massive and futile administrative burden on the ABT and the affected licensees. I do not think that it would add greatly to the efficiency of the Tribunal or indeed the various broadcasters who might be before the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of whether or not documents laid before the Tribunal would be public, I might be able to clarify the matter for the honourable member for Menzies. Obviously, if a document is presented to the Tribunal, it is a Tribunal document. If the Tribunal holds a public inquiry over concerns over a networking agreement, those documents will be placed in a public inquiry file and be open for public inspection; the proviso being that no confidentiality orders are made-for example, on the basis of commercial and confidential information. </PARA>

<PARA>That was, if you like, step one. Step two was when the Solicitor-General gave his opinion to the effect that the networking agreements that he had seen led him to the conclusion that they did admit another person to participate in any of the benefits of the licence. Indeed, that was, in fact, the reality. This is all set out in the explanatory memorandum which is worth reading. </PARA>
<PARA> The second step was that the Solicitor-General concluded that the networking agreements, in fact, did come within that description. Therefore, we are left with the situation that consent had to be given by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). We ask the question: What is wrong with that? What is wrong with requiring the Tribunal to give that consent? I cannot believe that the reason is that the Government wants to remove red tape and bureaucratic control, because we have just passed a Bill which gave another wheelbarrow load of red tape and bureaucratic control to the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that a lot of people find that these things are difficult to get their minds around; but, if one can get the argument up to the stage where the Solicitor-General's opinion is that when one looks at these networking agreements they do seem to give benefits to people and seem to admit people to the benefits of a licence and-although he did not say this-therefore, one can conclude that they should require the consent of the Tribunal, is that such a disastrous situation? There cannot be that many cases. It is not as though the Tribunal will be overburdened with work in approving them although there are, of course, a reasonable number of them. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is any doubt about it, is it not better to have a supervisory role given to the Tribunal to make sure that the regionals are allowed to remain viable? It is very important. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) has just been telling us-from what I know of it, quite rightly-of some of the attractive results of aggregation. Surely the Government would want to keep it that way? Surely the Government would want to keep it in such a way that the regional station does not become chained to the chariot wheels of the network. In effect, the double-sided balancing argument that the honourable member rightly put is really what is said in the advice that, I understand, was given to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). An additional part of that advice stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty is in ensuring equity for both parties to the agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then makes the first point, which is the honourable member's point as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>networks should be entitled to reasonable returns for supplying relatively low-cost programming to regional markets . . . whilst there should be scope and incentive for regional operators to sustain and develop local content. </PARA>
<PARA>That is also important. We would have thought that, if the Government goes ahead with this proposal, allowing these sorts of agreements without having some supervisory responsibility vested in the Broadcasting Tribunal, at the very least it is taking a risk in so far as the regionals are concerned that they may be dominated to an excessive extent by the networks. On the surface that would seem to be undesirable and something that we should try to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution, as this advice to the Minister also said, is that the current requirement for ABT approval for participation in the benefits of a licence could be retained. That advice is saying it could be retained whereas, in fact, what the Government is doing in this Bill is taking it out. The Government is negating that because this Bill is saying that section 89a does not apply if there is a networking agreement by definition. The definition in the Bill states that this does not apply if the regional is admitted to the benefits of the licence because of the terms of the agreement, because of a business relationship created by the terms or because of the dependence of the holder on that supply for the provisions of the service under the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill states that if the situation comes within that description it is not a section 89a case and does not require the approval of the Broadcasting Tribunal. I ask the question again: does the Government want to turn the regional stations into complete slaves, chained to the networks? That would seem to be an undesirable thing to do and, if there is that danger, we suggest that the Minister thinks again about it. I think that is all that need be said about that, but we will be proceeding with our amendment on that proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not move any amendments to clause 8. We did not oppose it; it was simply put as a question and remains a clause of the Bill. The principle concerning clauses 7 and 9 was the same as that concerned in clause 6 and, as I had spoken at some length about it, there was not much point in repeating it. But if the honourable member for the Northern Territory would like it repeated let me say that, with respect to supplementary radio licences referred to in clause 7 and remote licences referred to in clause 9, the Government is once again using this networking agreement, which is an agreement lodged with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, but not necessarily one approved by the Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is then saying that the party in the case of a supplementary radio licence or a remote licence is not taken to be admitted to any of the benefits of the principal licence-if I can put it that way-simply because of that networking agreement and the terms of that agreement or a business relationship created by those terms or the dependence of the holder on that supply for the provision of the services under the licence. The Government is simply consistently amending the Act in line with what it wants to do with respect to commercial licences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the point has been made that it is not appropriate to rely on the advice that was given by the Department of Transport and Communications to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) because it is really an opinion of the Solicitor-General, who says this is what should be done. That is not the case. The Solicitor-General gave advice that the networking agreements that he had seen would seem to come within section 89a of the Act and he also gave advice to the effect that they would seem to break the 60 per cent audience reach rules and one other provision that I have forgotten for the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the Solicitor-General did what he was asked to do-he gave an opinion to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal about the consequences of having these networking agreements. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications that the reality is that governments make decisions about what laws are passed in this place, not Solicitors-General. In fact, from what we have seen over the last couple of days there seems to be a lot of doubt about who decides what laws will be promoted here, and the Government gets them wrong on occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> But the point is that this advice that was given to the Department by the Minister was prepared after the Solicitor-General's opinion was given. We know that is true because the advice to the Minister refers to the Solicitor-General's opinion. The advice states:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time it is the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice--</PARA>
<PARA>The Government was faced with this situation and the Department, in effect, to put it very bluntly and concisely, said to the Minister, `This is the problem, this is the way you can solve it; but you have to be very careful that you don't chain these regional stations up to the chariot wheels of the networks and make them slaves'. That is what the Department said, with the knowledge of what the Solicitor-General has said, in his opinion. The wretched advice refers to the Solicitor-General's opinion, so the advice was obviously written after that opinion was given. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Government that the document states that some steps could be taken to ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power. The Government's position, apparently, judging from this memorandum, is that there should be a degree of affiliate bargaining power that could be put into the Act. Where in this Bill is there any degree of affiliate bargaining power? The document goes on to say that another step that could be taken is to give some local autonomy to regional channels. I ask: Where is the part in this Bill that gives local autonomy to regional channels? It is not there. The document goes on to mention program relevance. Where is that in the Bill? It is not there. The document states that the current requirements for ABT approval, for participation in the benefits of a licence, could be retained. The advice was that the requirement for Broadcasting Tribunal consent could be retained. The Government has not followed through on that advice. It is as plain as a pikestaff. It has done the opposite. It has not kept that power; it has taken it out. That is the purpose of this Bill-to take it out. It would seem on the surface that the Government-the Parliamentary Secretary has had 10 chances so far to rectify this-has acted contrary to the advice that the Department gave to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not here to be cross-examined about why that is being done-it is a Government Bill. I am simply asking why it is being done and I am simply making the point that, on the surface, it would seem not to be in the interests of regional stations. Therefore, I think there is a hint, a suggestion or a possibility that it may not be in the interests of regional viewers. The Government is rather inclined to identify the one with the other-the station and the viewers-because they are local people. It would seem that, on the surface, the Government is not promoting the interests of people in regional and rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice to the Minister goes on to say that some powers could be given to the Tribunal to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network services. The Government has not given additional power to the Tribunal in this part of the Bill to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network service. There is, therefore, a risk that affiliates will be exploited. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not imagine that the three networks and their executives spend their entire day thinking how they can exploit the regional television stations: but they are commercially driven by the interests of their shareholders or, in one case, the interests of the receiver, and they will have that uppermost in their minds. They will say, `We don't have at the top of our popularity parade the interests of the regional stations which we don't own. We have at the top of our hit parade our own interests'. They will say that because, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said on one occasion, one should always back self-interest because one knows it is trying. This is the commercial reality and if the Government wants to keep some balance in the situation it should really take a bit more care with the interests of regional stations and viewers and listeners whom the stations are there to serve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder why the Opposition has taken as holy writ one piece of advice which the Government has received. The Government has the ability to use advice as it seems appropriate. As the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) would know, the advice which has been given to the Department of Transport and Communications raised a number of options. It is appropriate, therefore, for the Government to make its own judgments about the advice which it receives. It has chosen to accept, as it has seen fit, the advice from the Solicitor-General and has acted accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question still remains. Whilst the Opposition shadow Minister for communications has said that he is concerned that the Government has not taken up certain aspects of the advice which has been provided by the Department, he has not yet told the Committee whether or not he believes that the advice which the Solicitor-General gave to the Government was appropriate. If it is appropriate, then the Government has acted as it ought to have acted. </PARA>
<PARA> The advice which has been provided by the Department gave a series of options. The honourable member said that that advice referred to the Solicitor-General's opinion. There is no question that the Department will have views and individuals will have views within other areas about what action should be taken as a result of the advice given by the Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has chosen this particular course. I do not believe, as the Opposition shadow spokesman has suggested, that this is going to cause difficulties for networks and regional stations. In fact, it will clarify the already existing situation, as I have said previously. The Opposition's amendments are in themselves internally inconsistent. Some of the amendments remove the exemption for copyright agreements. Other exemptions from copyright agreements are retained in clauses relating to the transfer of public licences and limited licences. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies might like to answer the question: why does the Opposition want the Tribunal for consent for any copyright agreements of commercial, supplementary and remote licences but not all public and limited licences?</PARA>

<PARA> The explanatory memorandum tells us something about the Government's reasoning behind this clause. As is often the case, it starts off with the Solicitor-General's opinion which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) seems to be mesmerised by, as if the whole world revolved around an opinion of the Solicitor-General. He might be the Solicitor-General, but that does not mean he is always right. On this occasion I think he is; but the Government should not, unless it is crazy, go wandering into an endless cavern as I think it is in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> This will not win it too many friends in country districts. It will certainly not win friends amongst the regional television stations. If the Government would rather just pick holes at our amendments rather than take them away and change them so that they are consistent with the thrust of what we are very clearly putting, then be it on its own head. It is not our responsibility to get the Government out of trouble. All we can do is alert it to a very reasonably held concern, which is held by regional television stations, by others and by the Opposition, because we would not be putting this up simply to fill in time. The Opposition is putting it up because it is a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is so dumb-I say `Government' collectively; I am not talking about any individual-that it is going to blunder ahead with this and probably lose the case in court, it will have egg all over its face as usual, as it did after the postage allowance case. It will probably have to pay the costs and get a long list of enemies in rural districts including every regional television station either involved in or sympathetic with this litigation. If this is what the Government wants then good luck to it. I could not care less if this is the result. I do not know why I am proposing these amendments.

It is possibly costing the Government less than the Solicitor-General's opinion cost, I should think, because he is getting paid a much higher salary than we are. I would urge the Government to give some further consideration to this before it ends up completely discredited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can read the explanatory memorandum. I am not going to read it into Hansard. It is all set out. The Solicitor-General reached the view, which I think is probably right, that these networking arrangements probably breached the 60 per cent rule. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Parliamentary Secretary was replying in the second reading debate, he said, in effect, how silly we were for raising this question. I asked, `What is the point of having the 60 per cent audience reach rule if it is going to be negated in effect by legislation as it is being negated here today?'. The Parliamentary Secretary came back with the reply that it is not a blanket exemption because the 60 per cent audience reach rule will still apply in metropolitan areas. Is that not clever? Do not tell me that audience reach rules were originally to apply only in metropolitan areas. I just do not believe that. I believe that they were devised with regional television stations in mind as much as metropolitan ones-unless we are being asked to believe that when the Government was calculating the population of Australia it excluded the population of all metropolitan areas. I cannot believe that. </PARA>
<PARA> The audience reach rule was never intended to be one that was limited only to metropolitan areas. So we will still persist with the question: why does the Government have a 60 per cent audience reach rule? Why not have a 100 per cent audience reach rule? Why have a 60 per cent rule if the Government comes along with these footling Bills and negates what it held out a couple of years ago as a great reform?</PARA>
<PARA> It would assist us and ease my passions about this if it could say `the cat sat on the mat' and tell us why it is doing it, preferably in words of one syllable so everyone will understand. As often is the case, these things defy any rational explanation. It seems to be motivated solely by a desire to make the Broadcasting Act even more complicated than it is. We heard the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) saying that he was confused. I can understand why he was confused; but the Government should make the position clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision that we have here has nonsense in it. We think it is an unwise thing that the Government is doing. It is contrary to advice that the Department apparently gave to the Minister. The Government is negating the law simply to keep the aggregation process going at its present pace. </PARA>
<PARA> There are arguments about aggregation on both sides. On balance, one would have to say, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) said, that there are identifiable benefits which viewers have from aggregation. So there is a lot to be said for advancing those. The Government is now just putting an axe through some very important provisions of the Act because it has got itself into another difficult court case. I see an honourable member opposite looking at his watch. I am anxious to conclude this as soon as possible. I am being urged on. I do not know why I am doing it because we are trying to keep the Government out of trouble and it does not welcome assistance. The point about it all is that there are problems with aggregation. We have said that we will review it. There is a strong case for having an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal review of aggregation. That is something the Government should give consideration to. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems are problems which are not going to be resolved simply by passing a piece of legislation like this to stop people pursuing their claims in the Federal Court, which they are doing. The plaintiffs in this case in the Federal Court have made the same point in substance as the Solicitor-General. He is virtually saying that they are right, because he is making the point that these networking agreements fairly clearly would run foul of the 60 per cent audience reach rule, and the probability is that the plaintiffs in this case have a fairly strong argument. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government just comes along and says, `We will just stop this action from succeeding by passing a law about it'. As I have said before, it may not even succeed now because this Bill probably will not go through the Senate and the case might be over before the Bill is passed. I suppose the Government will then say, `Another tricky thing we can do is legislate retrospectively'. I suppose that will be the next instalment. </PARA>
<PARA> While this is the way in which the Government conducts its business, we take a stand on principle, and we would urge the Government not to do it. The way to resolve this sort of problem is to have an inquiry into aggregation to try to address some of these problems. As I understand it, the Government has not spoken to the regional stations about these provisions. There should be consultation with them to try to resolve these problems about aggregation. We would have thought that was the better course for the Government to follow. But instead of that the Government will not listen to reason. The Government simply comes along and tries to change the law in time, if the Bill is passed, and retrospectively if the Bill is not passed in time, and tries to deny people from pursuing their rights. That is very wrong, and once the Government starts doing that it is going down a very rocky road indeed. So for those reasons the Opposition takes the view that clause 12 should be defeated. </PARA>

Let me just clarify for him what I said in my contribution to the debate earlier today. I emphasise that the amendments are needed to remove serious legal doubt about existing networking arrangements to metropolitan areas and the extension of commercial television services to regional areas under the equalisation program. I am sure that the honourable member for Menzies understands that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 60 per cent reach limit prevents common ownership or control of commercial television licences in each metropolitan area of Australia. This is because the metropolitan stations have an audience reach above 60 per cent. Unlike the Opposition, the Government is not prepared to jeopardise the continuance of existing networking arrangements to affiliates in metropolitan areas such as Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide; nor is the Government prepared to jeopardise the continuing extension of regional television services under the aggregation program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has argued that the networking arrangements have made the 60 per cent limit obsolete. However, the provisions do not provide a blanket exemption to networking licensees in terms of any control which can be exercised otherwise than as an incidental result of the supply of programs to a metropolitan regional licensee. The provisions also do not allow networking licensees to own additional metropolitan or regional stations in excess of the 60 per cent limit. I think that should clarify the position for the honourable member for Menzies. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the general comments made by the honourable member for Menzies about aggregation, the Government's position is very clear. We do not accept the propositions which have been put by him. We do not believe that this will jeopardise the aggregation arrangements which have been put in place or the regional television stations, and I think to suggest otherwise is misreading the Government's intentions. </PARA>

It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>These draft agreements provided for the supply of programs between companies representing commercial television networks and regional licensees in approved markets proceeding to direct aggregation of existing regional commercial television service areas. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum then goes on to say that the substance of the Solicitor-General's opinion was that the draft affiliation agreement would, if implemented, result in a breach-and I refer only to one of the consequences-of the 60 per cent reach limit. It is true that the Solicitor-General was there highlighting the consequence of having both the audience reach limits, which the Government put into the Act some time ago, and the networking agreements, which came about as a direct result of aggregation. Those networking agreements are, of course, agreements designed to regularise the relationship between the networks and the regional stations. Of course, the two, when one thinks about them, are inconsistent, and it was not surprising that sooner or later a clash would be identified between the two of them, and the Solicitor-General highlighted this clash. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach that the Government has taken is to say, `Well, therefore, you must change the law; therefore, you must negate the 60 per cent audience reach rule', and that seems to me to be a very curious way of approaching life. One would have thought that we should have a look at the aggregation system itself. It is just as well that I come from a profession that has regard to the time that it takes to say things rather than simply saying them, and I trust this will be borne in mind in the future. The reality is that, no matter how long it takes to say it and how many times one has to say it, the simple point is that it is unnecessary to follow the course that the Government has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Government should do is approach aggregation itself and say, `Let us have a review of that. Let us look at aggregation. Let us look at where the problems are. Let us look at why it is that some regional television stations do not want to proceed with aggregation'. I cannot believe that the stations are so perverse that they want to put up the shutters against the opportunity of having a wider market and possibly making money out of it. I think they probably do in their heart of hearts want to take a more active and vigorous role in television throughout a bigger area of Australia. But they see obvious problems with it, mainly because of the cost, and they have committed themselves, as I understand it, to vast sums of money to put aggregation into operation. That is the situation they are faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, the logical thing to do would be to have an examination of aggregation itself. This has been the Opposition policy for some time, and the fact that we were not elected at the last election should not be taken as a rejection of this position, because our audience reach was in fact larger than the Government's audience reach, and the proper way to go is to implement that policy. One way of doing it-and it is only one way-is to have an inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal itself, and there is power to have that done. From some of the correspondence that I have seen, it would seem that really the Government has not been following the proper course. It really should have looked seriously at this question of a specific inquiry directed to looking at aggregation itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Up until today the Government's argument has been along the lines that there is a licence renewal coming up in the Australian Capital Territory and therefore that is an opportunity to look at aggregation. In fact, more than that is needed; there must be a wider opportunity given for a further examination of aggregation. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). This is the fourth time I have praised him in this debate, and there has to be a limit to it. But the reality is that he rightly drew attention to some of the benefits-and there are benefits-for viewers of having a wider range of choices, a greater choice. We support that on the Opposition side. It is in the interest of viewers to have a wider choice and that is the reason we have been speaking in favour of pay television. We know that for whatever reason these days many people find that they are not being provided with services on television of the type that they want to watch. They having presented to them programs that the television stations want to show-that is true-and in some cases the programs are popular, but there are many sorts of areas that can be presented on television which are not presently provided by the free to air system and which could be provided by pay television. We say, `Choice, yes, you are right about that'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is right when he says that aggregation provides a wider choice for viewers, but the point remains that, despite that, there are problems with the implementation of it-with the cost, the timetable, the speed of the introduction, all of which are giving rise to anguish, and that anguish should be addressed properly. It can be addressed by an inquiry by the Broadcasting Tribunal; that is a proper way to go about it. But there is no point in simply coming along, as the Government has-and the present Government is not unique in this, I must admit-and saying, `Well, there are proceedings in the courts that are inconvenient to us. It does not fit in with our structure of the world so we will simply pass a law negating the law and we will say, ``Well, you can go and whistle for your proceedings in the Federal Court''.' That is what the Government is doing here. It is a very bad principle, no matter what government does it. I would think that it probably will not work in this case, but it is a bad principle anyway and not one the Government should embark on and not one that any government should embark upon. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other and better ways of solving the problems, as I have said, although we do not deny that there is a problem there that has to be dealt with and addressed properly. One cannot help observing that the Government must be smarting under this because a decision was given in the Federal Court yesterday in these proceedings which the Government lost. It was trying to strike out the statement of claim of the regional stations which are suing the Government. I am sorry to tell the Government that it lost again-I hope with costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to frustrate this action and trying to deny people their proper legal rights and I do not believe the Government will succeed. The Government should not even try-that is the point-because it will end up with egg on its face, even more than is usually there. We strongly advise the Government, if it wants advice, to desist from this course and start to act responsibly and properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point has to be made to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) that regional television has come down from a pretty good position. It is not so long ago when regional television was telling the networks how much they would pay for their movies and how much they would pay for good prime time viewing. That is what is happening. They were not paying very much at all. Now, admittedly, the networks are in a better position as far as dictating price is concerned but, at the same time, I think it can be said that the networks are not in a much better position financially. So regional television has come down from a fairly high position in the hierarchy of Australian television, especially the financial status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that another thing that needs to happen along with aggregation is the development of some community television. I think that in the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), there has been some community television work going on. I know that there are people in this region also who are interested, particularly Graham and Sandra Dyson down at Merimbula, who are looking into the possibility of combining community television with radio. They have gathered together a wide range of people with a wide variety of interests and they will come to the Government and say, `We would like to have our own community television service. We don't particularly want to set up in competition with other networks. What we want to do is perhaps for two or three hours a day present our own local news program'. None of the commercial stations are at all interested in showing a church service, a local football match or a local swimming competition. This is what the community television stations will do. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies has been extremely kind to me. I fully agree with what he has said about the need for balance and about the advantages and the questions concerning aggregation, but I think it also needs to be said that if we allow community television to proceed and develop then we are going to be able to have local input, so there will be less pressure on the commercial stations to have purely local input. I believe that for one or two hours a day local areas will have a television service which will present local news and events. When something is happening that is special in the local area people will know that they only have to turn over to that local service to get the benefit of it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely important that Australia, a large country with a relatively small population covering a wide area, provide communications, including broadcasting services, as quickly as possible and with the best quality possible. That is why in the last couple of years the Government has not only provided new television stations but also new radio stations. That is why people throughout Australia will be able to receive Radio National as well as regional radio stations. That is extremely important because it is recognising the fact that in country Australia we have people who are prepared to have a little more difficulty in living with the production of commodities which take up round about 50 per cent of our total exports. These people are entitled to good broadcasting services, good telecommunication services, good postal services, and good transport services. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadcasting is a very important facet. We have said to the Australian people in the country, `You can have a variety of television and radio services far bigger than you have ever had before'. We know that we have to draw the line somewhere and make sure that there is quality and yet, at the same time, maximise the financial benefits for the stations so that they can remain viable. I agree with the honourable member for Menzies: the regional stations have to remain viable, as well as the networks. The whole industry is having problems at the moment, not least people such as Bond, Skase and Crosser-particularly Bond and Skase, who paid too much for their networks and are now reaping the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the Government's fault or the taxpayers' fault that those people paid too much or borrowed heavily. They took that chance. We are now reaping a few problems from that. It is very evident that the financial establishment, the financial world in Australia, is coming to grips with the fact that we cannot afford to have huge firms hurting a whole lot of ordinary people. It is very important that we recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition's amendments are not warranted. The advice of the Solicitor-General, as has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, needs to be heeded and we ought to support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) a concern with the amendment. I think it really negates advice that has been duly given and which I think deserves to be followed. Aggregation is the issue that has been raised in this context. I frankly think that aggregation has been shown to be one of the better developments affecting much of provincial Australia, from my understanding of the issues. It was suggested by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) earlier in the discussion that many of the other problems associated with the total structure of broadcasting in Australia largely can be put at the foot of the Government, that they are due to Government action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro pointed out quite clearly that, on any sober reflection of broadcasting issues in Australia in the last decade, one would say that over the last five years in particular, and even over the last two or three years, the confusion and chaos that has been created has almost always been driven by some sort of entrepreneurial interest, with people paying excessive and exorbitant prices for commodities to feed all sorts of ego-driven concerns. I cannot see any justification at all for not seeking to try to balance that process out. Having seen some of the correspondence from some of the provincial related agencies I really do not think that their actions stand up to a terrible lot of scrutiny at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than take the approach that the honourable member for Menzies outlined of castigating the Government in this sort of fashion, I think this review of the Broadcasting Act provisions should be seen as part of a total process of refinement. As was outlined earlier in the second reading speech, we really have a chance with these particular provisions, and also the general review of the Broadcasting Act that is being planned by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), to ensure that our broadcasting industry is set on a solid, viable financial base not only from the point of view of the people who may be owners and players in that field but, just as importantly, in terms of the viability of all those communities which have a vital interest in this field, not only in terms of the dissemination of information but in terms of the diversity of choice that is so vital in both rural and provincial Australia and in areas such as the regions of Sydney that I represent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the main thrust of what I want to say is that the amendment is unnecessary. The legislation, as proposed by the Government, goes right to the hub of what is required and needed to start the whole process going of this general review of the broadcasting industry. Only in the last few days have I had people come to see me from various arms of the television industry, in particular, looking for stability and certainty and looking to the Government to create an environment in which their futures and the careers that they pursue in those industries can be secured. All of those things are best achieved by trying to achieve that sort of balance, that sort of rational viability and a return to soundness. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot see that just going off, basically taking up an amendment from one sectional group of the industry for economic reasons, is the way to go. It seems to me to be counterproductive in the extreme. I certainly support the provision as originally proposed in the Bill. I think that it is the fair and reasonable way of maintaining the issue. I trust that that will be the procedure ultimately adopted not only by this House but by the Parliament as a whole. I do believe that the framework is starting to work to ensure the viability of our broadcast industry and that it is set on the sort of footing that we would all like to see. I believe that the amendment moved by the Opposition should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) for his noteworthy contribution to this afternoon's debate. It has been a stimulating afternoon. We have had contributions from all sections of the Parliament. Not the least has been the contribution by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). It has been stimulating by example in one sense because of his erudite knowledge of the law and the way in which, as a learned friend might put it, he is someone who remonstrates with the Government on points of practice as well as points of law. It was good to see that he at least accepted the validity of the Solicitor-General's advice to the Government this afternoon and has not taken a course of action which has hitherto been taken on previous occasions by our opponents when they have condemned actions taken by this Government on the basis of the advice which has been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member did seek, however, to try to suggest that the Government was unwise not to take one portion of the advice which was provided to it by the Department of Transport and Communications. I reiterate that the Government may use its judgment as to whether or not it takes all the advice that it receives, and what advice it does take. In the context of this Bill before the House this afternoon, as I have said previously, it chose to take its interpretation of the Solicitor-General's advice. The result of that is the legislation before us this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Menzies made some comments about the issue of aggregation and the impact of this legislation on regional stations. If it is true that there is a negative impact upon some regional stations, there is the capacity for them to raise those concerns with the Government. As you well know, Mr Deputy Chairman-I am sure the honourable member for Menzies appreciates this-the Government is conscious of the need for the ongoing review process which is currently under way. This forms part of that review process. The package which has been provided to the House this afternoon has as its objective the provision of more efficient and effective regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to go back to the original statement from the honourable member for Menzies, in the context of his speech on this legislation, when he supported the thrust of much of what the Government has been doing. I am a little concerned that there seems to be some ambiguity between the approach taken to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the approach taken to the ABT by the honourable member for Menzies. It is clear that the right honourable member for New England regards the ABT as a bit of an anathema, whereas our friend the honourable member for Menzies, like the Government, believes that the ABT is a significant body which has a valuable contribution to play in broadcasting in Australia. It is within that framework that I understood that the honourable member for Menzies was indicating that he believed that as a result of the amendments proposed by the Opposition the ABT should be given further regulatory powers over broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a position which we accept. As I have reiterated previously in this debate, the Government is firmly of the view that the amendments which are proposed to the legislation will provide for addressing problems which have been highlighted by previous practice and will clarify the situation in relation to the advice given to us by the Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the legislation to the House. I ask the honourable member for Menzies to reconsider his proposals in the context of the discussions that we have had this afternoon, advice he received from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), and the contributions that have been made by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe); these should have highlighted for the honourable member for Menzies the need for him to reconsider his proposals, and indeed the Opposition's proposals, in the context of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> It was good to hear him say earlier on that one of these amendments is redundant because the previous one was lost. It is a foregone conclusion of the outcome of the debate, but the Opposition perhaps could have saved us some trouble in terms of that discussion. I understand that we are paying for his time and I appreciate his contribution in that regard. I have to say I am not a legal practitioner. I understand his comments about the cheapness of his advice, but I do not regard it as cheap. I think he has made a valuable contribution to proceedings this afternoon, and I believe that he has added quite a bit to the discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good to see that the debate which we have had this afternoon in the context of these amendments has been taken in the spirit of fair play which we like to see as part of the ongoing practice of the House. I am sure that I can prevail upon the honourable member for Menzies to reconsider his views and his Party's views about this legislation and to withdraw his amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to take the opportunity of making doubly sure that the general thrust of our propositions is firmly on the record. The first point to make is that there are a number of regional television stations which are concerned about what is being done here. I make the additional point that I certainly do not have any brief to stand here and appear for them. Nevertheless, it is significant and important that their point of view should be expressed for two reasons. First of all, they have a major role to play in television presentation in regional and rural areas. Secondly, there has always been assumed to have been an identity of interest almost between the viewers in those areas and the stations themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point that when the regional stations express a view, it is not simply a view motivated by their commercial interest, although that is obviously something they take into account, but it is also a view which they present because they identify themselves with people who live in those areas. It is important to understand that when these views are being expressed they are views being expressed with the interests of the viewing public in those areas very much in mind. That must be very clearly understood. Some of those who are concerned about it are the stations known as BCV, GLV, TNT, DDQ, SDQ, NRN, RTN, WIN, RTQ, NBN and Capital. They are concerned, as a number of us are, about what is being done here. In a nutshell, the concern arises, as I have said, because the Government is seeking to insert into the Broadcasting Act a new section 89ea, which I have already referred to, and new subsections 89a (14) and (15). </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to go over these in detail again because I have already done that, but the substance of the amendments that the Government is making to the Broadcasting Act should be understood. One could summarise it by saying that the substance of those amendments is to exempt-that is, to take away from the operation of the relevant ownership and control provisions-control of an otherwise independent licensee arising out of program supply arrangements. As we know, these program supply arrangements are embodied in what are known as networking agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> There is concern also about what is in substance-and I do not think the debate we have had has disproved this proposition-the removal of the role and the province of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for its consent to be given to those networking agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) has perhaps been engaging-and I do not say this in any critical sense-in a bit of hair splitting, the reality is that section 89a of the Act does in fact require consent. It is not very often that an Act says that consent must be given and then go on to say if it is not given then the Tribunal is not to do something. That is not often found in an Act. Presumably, in so far as this Parliament concentrated on what it was doing when it passed the Broadcasting Act, it really meant it. It was a double assurance that the Tribunal would be required to give consent to those sorts of arrangements. That is being negated here, and that must be clearly understood. </PARA>
<PARA> Those stations that I have referred to-and others which have an interest in this matter-recognise that there are defects in the present legislation. Some of them have been highlighted by the opinion of the Solicitor-General. The point must be made-and I say this again without any critical sentiment behind it at all-that the Parliamentary Secretary is quite wrong when he says that there is no need to change the law at all. That is not the case; it is very clear that there have to be some changes here. But the burden of our complaint is that there is no need to make the sorts of changes that are being made here. There is no need to use a sledgehammer because the concentration should be on what the problem is. The problem is the concern that people have about the way in which aggregation is being implemented and the costs that are involved in it, not its end objective. That should be clearly understood. What we say is not that there is no need to change the law, but that it is not being changed in the right way. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation has been raised by the Department itself. I come back to the point that this is not simply us just scratching around to find ammunition to hurl over the benches at Government members; it comes from the Department itself where there are some very intelligent, perceptive people at work. What we are saying is that the Government really should be listening to its advice.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to understand what its advice was. Only as recently as 2 February, the Department informed the Minister in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued that the dominant supply position of each network, viz-a-viz its affiliates, may threaten those affiliates' ability to retain sufficient revenue to provide programming adapted to local needs. At the same time it is the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice that such arrangements give the networks `legal control' of the affiliates for the purposes of the Broadcasting Act, thus creating various breaches of the Act's ownership and control provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>So the advice was given, and the Department recognised when it was giving that advice, that there was a need to improve the regional stations' bargaining power. That is what this is all about-bargaining power. What the Government is really doing by these amendments is committing the regional stations to a slave state. They are being bound to the chariot wheels of the networks and tying them up. They will end up having to show `Spartacus' every night if we go on like this. They really are being put in an inferior position. It would seem to me that it is very undesirable to do that. It is not just the Opposition making this point; the Department has told the Government about it and given advice to the Minister to the effect that something should be done. I will elaborate on the point of what the Department said it should do. </PARA>
<PARA>Some steps could be taken to ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power. </PARA>
<PARA>I just ask: has the Government put anything in this Bill which will ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power for the regionals? (Quorum formed) Before the quorum was called I was drawing the attention of the Committee to the fact-(Extension of time granted). I was making the point that the advice given by the Department to the Minister was that some steps could be taken to ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power. I ask the rhetorical question: is there anything in this Bill which does ensure a degree of affiliate bargaining power? It is clear that what was in the Act with regard to the extent of any power for affiliates is still there. </PARA>
<PARA> It is equally clear that there has been no improvement in the affiliates' bargaining position. There is no increase in that power being written into the Act. So it would seem that the answer to the question that I asked is no. Again I ask: when one sees the advice to the Minister was that some steps could be taken to ensure a degree of local autonomy, is there anything in this Bill which gives a degree of autonomy to the regional channels? No, there is not; there is nothing at all. There is nothing new in this legislation that enhances the autonomy of the regional stations. The advice was that some steps could be taken to ensure programming relevance. Is there anything which is being written into the Bill to enhance program relevance? The answer to that must be no, there is not. </PARA>
<PARA> The point remains-it has now been made several times; I am sure that even Government members will understand it-that the advice given by the Department to the Minister has been ignored in this legislation. I gather that the answer to this is, `Well, it is just one piece of advice. There is other advice'. Perhaps we ought to have a look at that, too. That might take up another half hour. We will see whether that advice has been followed. Indeed, there might be contrary advice. In fact, this argument of the Parliamentary Secretary reminds me of Churchill, who said once that he read only every second paragraph of a memorandum from the Foreign Office because every second paragraph started off with `On the other hand'. It seems that the advice given by this Department to the Minister-if we accept what the Parliamentary Secretary has said-may be fashioned on the same principle. Perhaps there is some inconsistent advice. If there is inconsistent advice that says, `No, you really should screw the regional television stations into the dirt', I would like to see that, too. We might have quite a lot to say about that. The point is that the advice goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Some powers could be given to the Tribunal-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the essential point-</PARA>
<PARA>to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network stations. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that could happen. We make two points about that: one is that, because of the requirement to consent that is in the Act already, that power is there for the Tribunal to prevent exploitation of the regionals. But the Government is diluting it, negating it, and taking it out of the legislation. So the Government is putting regional television stations at risk of being put into a subservient position. That would seem to be a very unhealthy and nonsensical thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point we make about it is that the Government has not put any new power into the Act for the Broadcasting Tribunal to prevent exploitation of affiliates by the network services. It is worth repeating the difficulties expressed in the advice from the Department. Again, I have to praise the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), but it is the last time I will do it-it is the tenth time I have done so-for his contribution, when he said that one of the concerns about aggregation is that the network has to be given some incentive to go into a region and incentives have to be given to the regional stations to spread out and expand their broadcasting into the new areas of aggregation. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro rightly made that point. The Department's advice rightly makes that point. But the Department's advice makes another countervailing point, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>Networks should be entitled to reasonable returns for supplying relatively low cost programming to regional markets-</PARA>
<PARA>this is the point that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro so adequately made-</PARA>
<PARA>whilst there should be scope and incentive for regional operators to sustain and develop local content. </PARA>
<PARA>Another paragraph follows on from that one. I will not take up time by reading out additional parts of the advice, but the point must be made that there is nothing at all in this Bill which will give any incentive or scope for regional operators to sustain and develop local content. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night we had a lot of heroic speeches, not only from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro-whom I have praised on this matter-but also from the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who made the same point. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), believe it or not, also made a powerful point. They were emphasising what an important part of the broadcasting infrastructure was comprised by regional stations. They were right about that. I ask the question again: If regional broadcasters are so significant, which they clearly are, why is the Government negating them? Why is the Government chopping them off at the feet in this piece of legislation? Why is the Government doing it?</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before in this debate, I wonder why I am trying to persuade the Government to stop committing suicide, which is what the Government is doing. It is alienating a lot of people associated with the regional stations and thereby alienating a lot of their viewers and listeners. The Government is also probably alienating the readers of Hansard at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the basic point is that the Government is right, absolutely right, when it emphasises the importance of regionalism. But here the Government is not only not advancing the interests of regional stations and their viewers but is also going contrary to their interests. The Government has already been warned that what it is doing here is running the risk of putting regional stations in a subservient position, turning them into slaves, chaining them up to the chariot wheels of the networks. That is the great danger of what the Government is doing. We believe very strongly that that is not a course that the Government should follow. It is not in the interests of broadcasting as a whole. It is not in the interests of regional broadcasting. It is certainly not in the interests of the stations themselves, and it is not in the interests of viewers, because the Government is running a risk of destroying the local content element of regional broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> The example that I gave before was probably too extreme but it seemed to get people's attention, which was that there could be a networking agreement that said, `There will not be any local news at all. We will provide the news for you'. It is hard to imagine the networks doing that, but the reality is that they will be driven by commercial interests and who can blame them for that? In one case, they are acting in the interests of a receiver of the company and, in the other, the interests of their shareholders. Of course, they will be motivated by commercial interest and fair commercial interest will always be paramount over and above the commercial interests of a regional station. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite clearly, as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has said, one should always back self-interest because one knows it is trying. No doubt the networks will be motivated, among other lofty motives, by that principle. Obviously they will not be writing into the network agreements clause after clause to benefit the regional stations: they will be writing clauses in to benefit themselves, and who can blame them for doing that? There must be an umpire, someone to stand, in effect, between these quite disparate commercial interests of the networks on the one hand and the regionals on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is denying that: it is preventing that from happening. It is not just bad legislation; it is not in the interests of the stations, their viewers and, as I have said one or twice before, it is not in the Government's own interests. I do not know why it is doing this. We seek to persuade the Government from that course and urge it to think again about what it is doing in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> What all this comes down to is a spotlight being put on this problem in the law by the Solicitor-General who, on this occasion, was right. He is not always right, but who is? But on this occasion I think the Solicitor-General was right. I agree with him. If the Government went along to the Solicitor-General today and said, `Thanks for your advice. What we are going to do to implement the advice is to pass a law that stops people from going to the Federal Court to promote their legitimate interests in a case which they have already started', the Solicitor-General would say, `I didn't give you advice to that effect. I didn't tell you to do that. That's not the advice I gave you'. So the Government cannot rely as far as it has on the Solicitor-General's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> We urge the Government to think again about this because what it is doing is not in the interests of any of the parties involved. It is not in the interests of the stations, their viewers and listeners and, as I have said, it is not even in the Government's own interests because sooner or later it will come unstuck on this. The course that the Government is following is quite undesirable in many respects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). I must say that from my office and the chamber the language that he used was most persuasive to me and I have been forced in fact to come from my office to the chamber to see this performance of persuasion at first hand and to rehearse in my mind the arguments that are being used by the honourable member. I know that his choice of language has been superb and that has served to illustrate even more extensively the points he seeks to make. I thank him for the opportunity of seeing his persuasive powers both in my room and in the chamber. I am completely persuaded and I cannot understand why members of the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) are not also persuaded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Maybe it is the repetition of the salient points that has persuaded me. Maybe it is the expanded arguments that have been injected on each occasion that have persuaded me. However, the principle of what the honourable member for Menzies has been saying is really at the nub of the Bills we are considering today. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member has used language such as `chaining the regional stations to the wheels of the chariots of the network'. I think that is a proper description of what has occurred. He has spoken of putting them into slavery. What he is saying in wonderfully descriptive language is, `Put your shackles on my wrists and take me away into slavery because I am no longer able to control the programs that are so earnestly wanted by the people that I serve as a regional television station'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is in the chamber. I know that his network system in the north of Queensland is critical to the people in his State and to that great area of tourism and commerce that he serves. The honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) is also in the chamber. I know that he would love to have a regional station unshackled, not chained to the chariot wheel, serving the western part of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> But no, the Government has chosen not to take that path. It has chosen to say that through the process of having the programs nominated by the networks these regional stations will not be their own people: they will not be able to serve the people of Fowler, northern Queensland or even Parramatta. I see that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) is in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> What could be better than a regional station working perhaps from western Sydney? A proposition has been put by 2WS, and I think it is a good one, that there should be a western regional station. How can that station effectively serve the people of Sydney unless it is unmanacled, unchained and free from slavery? I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his persuasive arguments. I know that the Government must agree. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill makes provision to enable the Remuneration Tribunal to make determinations in respect of those matters covered by the provisions of the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990 passed by the Parliament today, except for the basic salary of members of parliament which is linked to movements in the Senior Executive Service band 1. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, in the context of amendments made to that Bill in the Senate relating to the levels of remuneration of Whips and other office holders from all parties the Remuneration Tribunal should be asked to review the relativities of a number of offices. All parties supported that approach. The Bill provides that such determinations can be made, operative from 2 June 1990. In addition, amendments made by this Bill will ensure that nothing in the Bill overrides the operation of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 which gained the royal assent last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments are made to preserve the operation and effect of previous determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal which relate to parliamentary secretaries, travelling allowance for parliamentarians and other office holders and other matters which are not replaced by the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear on behalf of the Opposition at the outset that the Opposition understands why the Remuneration and Allowances (Amendment) Bill 1990 is necessary, but let me say to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that the speech that he has just delivered has characterised the Government's handling of this issue over the last 48 hours. What the Minister did not tell the Parliament is that this Bill is necessary because the Government has advice from Parliamentary Counsel that the effect of the legislation passed through this Parliament in the last 24 hours has been to repeal the provisions of the Parliamentary Allowances Act which, of course, was made necessary by the ultra vires conduct of the third Hawke Government in helping itself to the public exchequer in relation to postage stamps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it clear that, although the Opposition has supported the direction of this Bill, we would be failing in our obligation to the Parliament-and I suggest the Government is failing in this itself-in not having something to say about the extraordinary incompetence which has characterised the Government's handling of this issue. After all, it claims to be the greatest Ministry since World War II. It claims to have on the front bench a luxurious array of talent. It claims to have available to it the best and brightest minds in the nation to give it advice. It claims to attract people like a magnet in terms of its administration and its discharge of its ministerial responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> True it is that the Minister at the table will say to us, `You had the Bill, why didn't you spot the problem?'. There is a bit of a difference when the Opposition has only 10 minutes, and does not have the resources of government at its disposal. It might be a valid argument if the normal rules obtained but, of course, the normal rules did not obtain. He might also say that it has long been a convention in this Parliament that when matters relating to salaries and allowances are dealt with it is all done in a great hurry. </PARA>
<PARA> It used to be done by the Leader of the Opposition asking the Prime Minister a question about how members' emoluments had lagged behind. That process was always proceeded with because people assumed that there was competence on the part of the government and that it could get it right. But it has taken this Government not one, not two, not three but four bites of the cherry-and even now I cannot say, on behalf of the Opposition, that I am satisfied that this is okay. I do not have the resources to say that. I said to my colleagues this afternoon in a shadow ministry meeting that I cannot guarantee them, in the short time that is available, that there is not some other legal or administrative flaw in this particular piece of legislation. Yet we are told that this is the greatest Ministry since World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> I know there are a lot of people who want to go home, but occasionally reverence and concern for this place transcends travel convenience. It has been a characteristic of the fourth Hawke Government, in the two weeks and two days that this Parliament has met, to treat this institution with contempt. It started with the address of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to the National Press Club on the consumption tax. It has been continued with the attitude taken by the Government towards the televising of Parliament. After this `Fawlty Towers' performance, one really knows why the Government does not want to televise the House of Representatives. How would it look-the fourth Hawke Government, in all its resplendent, brilliant glory, looking monumentally incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that this is what happens when a government is in bondage to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The reality of this whole remuneration saga is that, if the Government were not in bondage to the ACTU and did not have to get the permission of Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty to deal with parliamentary and other matters, it would not be in this particular predicament. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is not the view of the Opposition that this Bill should be denied a second reading because it purports, as it were, to affirm what people thought they were doing last night, I move the following amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add: That whilst not denying this Bill a second reading, this House is of the opinion that the Government's handling of this and related legislation displays extraordinary administrative and ministerial incompetence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. The farce surrounding the Remuneration and Allowances (Amendment) Bill was seen last night when the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was found to be totally out of control of the Parliament and had no comprehension as to what this legislative action was to be, let alone what his motions to be moved were. I observed him last night as he mouthed the words of the Clerk at every turn, and saw that he was totally bereft as to what was transpiring at that point of time in this House. That, in a way, crystallised the Government's attitude to the legislation itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has been-I will use a delicate term-a monumental stuff-up from the beginning. It goes back to stamps, when the Government was caught with its fingers in the till and my predecessor, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), as the shadow Attorney-General, called the Government's bluff when it tried to jack up the stamp allowance from $9,000 to $30,000. He took the Government to the High Court of Australia. The High Court found five-love-five-nil-in favour of the honourable member for Menzies. It brought the Government to the point where, despite that decision of the High Court, its then Minister told its parliamentarians and others in the Senate to keep spending-to spend, spend, spend. It mattered not what the High Court had done. The Government brought in legislation to try to validate the whole thing; we moved sensible amendments; the Senate supported us; the legislation went through and became the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the elements of this remunerations Bill, of course, has been to try to sneak through the back door again a discretion to vest in the Minister the right to overrule the Remuneration Tribunal and, as a consequence, the Government is invalidating-with the legislation that has gone through Parliament-that Parliamentary Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It takes a touch of exquisite genius to stuff it up like this but, boy, the Government did it. In the words of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), this claims to be the greatest Ministry since Federation and it cannot even get its stamps right, let alone the entitlements that it perceives to be necessary and the way in which they ought to be paid, despite what the Tribunal has said. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of the Remuneration and Allowances Bill has, allegedly, inadvertently repealed the substance of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act in that the former purports to reinstate the discretion of the Minister for Administrative Services to allocate benefits, which discretion had been limited by the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. Fair dinkum, I have never seen a performance like it and I do not think too many of those who have served in this Parliament for a long time on the Government's side of the House have seen it either. It is unique. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the Government sought to defy the law in the past, not only has it been aberrant morally in terms of the expenditure in the election campaign; but when the Government seeks to try to validate a proposition, it also invalidates the legislation that has hitherto been passed by the Parliament. As I say, a touch of exquisite genius. There is much that I could say on this matter-for instance, I could reiterate the provisions of the Bill-but I will not do so. The honourable member for Bennelong has pointed out just what the Government has reduced this Parliament to. No wonder it is held in disfavour and discredit. I will not detain honourable members any longer. I strongly support the amendment of the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No it is not, because the problem that the Government is faced with now-the shambles that has been visited upon it-comes from its attempt to deceive the Australian people from the very beginning. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has made it perfectly plain. He was absolutely right when he said that this whole saga began when the Government was not prepared to accept the lawful decision of the Remuneration Tribunal on postage allowances. It was the proper role of the Remuneration Tribunal to examine that matter. It was within the law. But the Government decided, for the basest of political reasons, to seize that decision from the Remuneration Tribunal, and said, `No, there is an election coming up and we want more in postage allowances so we will, illegally, take it away from the Remuneration Tribunal and do it ourselves', and the Government increased the $9,000 postage allowance to $30,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was an illegal act. The Government was told that it was an illegal act. A number of honourable members on this side of the Parliament told the Government that it was an illegal act, and, instead of doing the reasonable and sensible thing, instead of looking at it rationally and calming the situation down, the Government's response was simply to ridicule us. The Government said that it was nonsense and the then Minister advised Government members to go ahead and spend, spend, spend-spend the $30,000. The matter went to the High Court of Australia and the Government got its comeuppance. It was put firmly back in its place and it was told that it had acted illegally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Kooyong reminds us, not only did the Government lose five-love, not only did the court deliver one judgment, but, also, an order for costs was made against the Government which have not been paid. Not only was there one very glaring illegality where the Government was utterly exposed and defeated, but it has also compounded the whole thing because it now says to those honourable members who have overspent illegally, `Well, we will twist and contort the discretion that the Minister for Finance has so that those illegally paid moneys will not be paid back'. That is the course that the Government has now embarked upon-to twist and contort the discretion of the Minister for Finance-and that is equally reprehensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the course that the Government started on. That is the road it decided to go down and from that original deception has come this utter and complete shambles. The Government needed legislation to undo what it had done illegally in the first place-it tried to do that illegally and retrospectively-and this is what it is faced with today. The whole thing is a disgrace and the Government should be utterly ashamed of itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well. I should take the time of the House. The events of the last few hours in this place have been like a comic opera. The Government, in disarray, cannot get its legislation right and, when it gets the legislation, it cannot properly handle it in the House. It does not know whether it is going to sit for part of the day or the whole of the day. We were led to believe early this morning that the House would rise at around three o'clock this afternoon. I sought from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) an opportunity for the Opposition, and indeed for Government members, to question the Government in an ordinary way at Question Time, and that was refused because the House had to get up at three o'clock. We are here now at a quarter past six having stitched up legislation, as I think the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pointed out, for the fourth time. These are signs of an incompetent government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said that I would not take the time of honourable members in the House by going over what I have said on previous occasions during this present session of Parliament, but I repeat one thing: it is a disgrace that the Commonwealth Parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate, will sit for such a short period during 1990. It will be the shortest sitting period for 50 years and the second shortest sitting period since Federation. As several members on this side of the House have pointed out today during the course of debates, the Parliament is being treated with contempt by this Government and, through the House, the Government is treating the people of Australia with contempt. I would ask, as I close, that the Leader of the House give further consideration to the Budget sittings pattern with a view to increasing it by at least three weeks. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 73a of the Crimes Act 1914 makes it an offence:</PARA>
<PARA>for a Member of Parliament to receive, ask for, or offer a bribe to exercise his/her authority in a particular way, and</PARA>
<PARA>for another person to offer a bribe to a Member of Parliament for such a purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 88 of that Act may also be relevant in some cases. It creates an offence of buying or selling offices. It relates to the obtaining of employment in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The maximum penalty prescribed by both sections of the Crimes Act 1914 referred to above is imprisonment for 2 years. Pursuant to sub-section 4b (2) of the Crimes Act 1914 a pecuniary penalty of up to $12,000 may be imposed in addition to, or in substitution for, the term of imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA> These are indictable offences and therefore subject to the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 which would empower a court to order the confiscation of any benefit received. The provisions of the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act 1989 also apply to Members of Parliament who are charged with an offence involving an abuse of office, or committed for a purpose involving corruption or to pervert the course of justice.</PARA>
<PARA> This empowers a court to order that the offender is not entitled to any superannuation benefits, paid or payable by the Commonwealth, other than his/her employee contributions and interest accrued on those contributions.</PARA>
