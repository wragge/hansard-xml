<PARA> This petition of Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House that they are concerned at the threat to the environment which may result from an acceleration of the Greenhouse Effect. Your petitioners believe that urgent legislative action is necessary to protect the environment and reverse the damage already inflicted upon it. In particular, action is required to:</PARA>
<PARA> recycle products that save our trees and assist to eliminate waste;</PARA>
<PARA> stop deforestation of rain forests and provide funding to encourage tree planting;</PARA>
<PARA> ban the exporting and importing of chlorofluorocarbons with the same exceptions as those specified in the Ozone Protection Act;</PARA>
<PARA> ban all harmful chemicals, especially toxic bleaching chemicals used in paper mills throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> monitor the disposal of waste chemicals and products by Australian firms;</PARA>
<PARA> punish illegal dumping of chemical waste products and accidental spillages;</PARA>
<PARA> introduce tax incentives for research, development, manufacturing and marketing of renewable energy alternatives and development of technology to reduce or avoid the use of chemical pollutants; and</PARA>
<PARA> recycle all household wastes.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to take the necessary legislative action to promote all aspects of conservation and preserve our precious environment.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

Australia is and always will be a Christian majority country.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore pray that the House will ban this film and subsequent videos of The Last Temptation of Christ, because a country that denounces God, or God in His Son Jesus Christ, is a country doomed.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with my colleague: it is blatant theft. It was illegal and immoral, as was subsequently proved by the challenge taken to the High Court of Australia, because the Government had neither the backing of the Remuneration Tribunal nor appropriation available to it to increase the stamp allowance available for members of parliament from $9,000 to $30,000. The only reason that this grubby affair was attempted by the Government was to give the ALP a free kick for its re-election campaign to the tune of over half a million dollars, at taxpayers' expense. The Government was caught out by my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), who was astute enough at law to know that what the Government was doing was not only immoral but also illegal and, with his subsequent challenge to the High Court, he proved the illegality of its actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill before us today is nothing more than an attempt to get the Government off the hook. Not one member of parliament now has any facility legitimately available to that member. The stamp allowance and every other facility that we have or are using at the moment are illegal and have been held to be so by the High Court. This legislation is designed for no other purpose than to get the Government off the hook. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that when the Parliament opened on Tuesday it was the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who said that parliamentary practices should reach a higher standard than has been the case in the past. I do not think any of us would disagree with the Prime Minister's comment. But it is a sad irony that, under the new approach being adopted by the Government, the very first piece of legislation being considered is grubby, shabby and has no integrity. It will only add to the cynicism that the public has towards the parliamentary institution. It is a sad irony but perhaps an accurate reflection of the way in which this Government treats the Parliament and the provisions available to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of my remarks last night I was about to comment on one of the worst features that the Government has embarked upon, which is to remove the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. My colleague the honourable member for Menzies explained in some detail exactly how it will work. It is a sad irony that this whole grubby affair will take away the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind those new members of parliament who are joining us for the first time that it was the Whitlam Government in 1973 that set up the Remuneration Tribunal to be an independent body to look at the salaries and provisions available to members of parliament and to make an independent assessment of what facilities could be made available. That is what it should be. Members of parliament should not be judges of their own worth to the community. It should be done correctly and independently-and that is precisely what the Remuneration Tribunal was set up to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is now totally undermining the independence and the integrity of the Remuneration Tribunal. It has established an umpire but, because the umpire did not give the Government the decision it wanted, the Government said, `We're going to toss the umpire out and overrule him'. </PARA>
<PARA> I put a proposition to our new colleague the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) in his former role with the Australian Council of Trade Unions: if the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission had made a decision that the Government did not like, what would have been the reaction of the trade union movement if the government of the day had said, `No. We don't like that decision. We're going to legislate to overrule the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission'? All hell would have broken loose not only in the trade union movement but in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> That is precisely what the Government has done in this case: it has overruled the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal; it has established its own authority. It has not accepted the umpire's decision and it wants to take away the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. This is not only an immoral act but also an illegal act. It has been done without appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable members opposite that, if we are to have a proper, legitimate review of the salary and facilities available to members of parliament, it must be done by an independent body of people, and the most appropriate body to do that is the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members would be well aware the Remuneration Tribunal brings out regular reports that make recommendations as to the salaries and facilities that should be made available to members of parliament. It has been the sad practice of governments, starting with the Fraser Government and certainly continuing with the Hawke Government, to overrule recommendations made by the Remuneration Tribunal which were not to their satisfaction or did not fit in with the policies of the government of the day. They have had no compunction in overruling the recommendations made by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to some of our new colleagues that in the 10 years from 1978 the government of the day-both Liberal and Labor-overruled the Remuneration Tribunal on seven separate occasions. We are saying that we will set up this independent body to tell us the facilities that should be available to members of parliament but if we do not get the right answer, we will not accept its recommend-ation; we will overrule it anyway. That is precisely what the Government has done this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there should be a resolution by both of the major parties in this place that we accept the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal without question and without comment. Every time political parties or politicians, and more particularly governments, become involved in trying to determine the salary, the facilities and other provisions available to members of parliament, they make a hell of a mess of it. That is precisely what the Government has done on this occasion. It was trying to give its Labor colleagues throughout Australia a free kick at the taxpayers' expense to help with its re-election campaign. That was wrong. It has been proven to be wrong. It has been proven to be illegal, and the Parliament, rather than questioning the honourable member for Menzies for his astuteness, ought to be congratulating him for playing out his role quite properly.

It has undermined the credibility of all members of parliament in the community. Thanks only to the astuteness of the honourable member for Menzies is the real shabbiness of this affair being exposed to the public. I hope that this is a lesson not only to this Government but also to any future governments that if they are thinking about using the public facilities available to members of parliament for partisan political purposes they should dismiss such thoughts before those matters go as far as this particular episode has gone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been motivated to rise by the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). I want to put on record that during last year and this year the Government acted with the utmost perspicacity, responsibility and integrity on this matter. The first thing that I want to say is that during the Budget deliberations last year all of the legal and departmental advice to me was that it was open for the Government to make the decisions that it did with regard to increasing the postal allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that what we did on that occasion was to increase the amount of the postal allowance to some $30,900, which would include the amount necessary to enable each member of the House of Representatives to write once per year to each constituent. There were ample-I repeat, ample-examples overseas, particularly in the United States of America and Canada, for that action. For instance, I understand that in the United States members of the House of Representatives can write five times per year to their constituents at public expense. Last year it seemed to me and to the Government that what we were doing by giving each member of the House of Representatives the right to communicate once per year by increasing their postal entitlement by that amount was quite a reasonable and rational thing to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were advised of the result of the High Court case and I immediately on that day sought advice from my Department and the Attorney-General's Department as to the course of action that we should follow. We received advice on that day and that advice was encapsulated in a press release that I issued on that day on behalf of the Government. Subsequently, within several days, I received legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, which I am quite prepared to table in this House. I quote briefly from that advice, which concluded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pending any further challenge we think it open to the Government of the day to proceed on the basis that the executive power extends to providing postal facilities to Members of Parliament to enable them to carry out their parliamentary duties. A statutory basis for the Minister's decision to allow members the use of postal facilities since 16 November 1989 may be found in clause 10.2 of Determination No. 17 of 1989 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the summary of the decision is that the High Court decision was relevant until the date that the Remuneration Tribunal's report was delivered and that, after that date, given that the Tribunal did not mention the matter of postage in its report, it was open for the Government's decision to increase the amount to $30,900 to prevail. That is the basis on which I continued to operate and through the press release authorised the use of money for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no basis whatever for the previous Opposition speaker to say that this was some sort of grubby exercise by which we tried to put our hands in the till and so on. I am telling honourable members that we proceeded on the basis of the Attorney-General's advice at that time as to the effects of the High Court decision. That is encapsulated in the document from which I have read. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, after that, it was suggested to me by the Department that I should send out a circular to all members and senators advising them of this legal advice from the Attorney-General. I have in front of me here a copy of the proposed circular, which I am quite prepared to table in this House. It concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's decision as notified in my circular memorandum of 18 August 1989, the amounts available to Senators and Members for expenditure on their postage entitlement during the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Senators-$9,482</PARA>
<PARA> Members-$30,982</PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of the Attorney-General's advice, my Department came to me and said, `Send out this circular'. I said, `Wait a minute. Let's just make absolutely sure of this'. That is why I am making this contribution today. I want to assure the House, the nation, and indeed the Senate, when this Bill goes there, of the absolute purity of our intentions and the integrity of the Government and me. I was advised to send the circular out. I said, `No, we have already put the press release out. Let's stay with that pending advice from counsel'. I am quite prepared to table this minute which was sent to me on 2 March. I said that I noted the minute, but I did not sign the circular at this stage. I wrote on the paper, `I note the AG's advice that is set out in the attachments and marked A and B by me in this minute'-that is the relevant advice that I have just informed the House of which was given to me at the time. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Before the proposed circular is signed and posted to members and senators, please have counsel check the AG advice. </PARA>
<PARA>I also stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I note that MPs and senators can proceed on the basis of the press release of 1 March which was cleared by the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>So I said, `We will wait; we won't send the circular out. I accept the preliminary advice'-which was all I could do in early March-`but I will seek counsel's opinion on this matter'. So I rejected the advice of the Attorney-General's Department and I rejected the advice of the Department to send out the circular at that time, but I sought counsel's advice. </PARA>
<PARA> I was then informed that counsel may have had some views that perhaps the early advice of the Attorney-General may not be as firm as it seemed and that, furthermore, the decision of the High Court could draw all of these other entitlements that had not been approved by the Parliament or the Tribunal, such as the entitlements of Opposition office-holders and all the rest of it that is listed in this Bill. I can table this letter too. </PARA>
<PARA> We said to my Department, `Can you please now ask counsel to check the whole position and if he has any doubts about the interim Attorney-General advice, then to come back to me as to what should be done on this matter and how it might affect all of these other entitlements that have not been approved by the Tribunal or the Parliament?'. That is exactly what happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying that after the initial request to counsel at the time I said that it was premature to sign the circular, that we would take the preliminary advice from the Attorney-General and proceed, but that on my initiative we would seek counsel's advice on the matter of postage. Several days later it was drawn to my attention that perhaps other matters, such as honourable members' entitlements, might be affected at that particular time. I said, `Refer that to counsel too so that we can get the full picture, and then when Parliament resumes it can take its decisions based upon the advice of counsel'. That is exactly what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that all of these documents are here and open to perusal; that is right through from the High Court decision when we received the interim Attorney-General's advice, decided to go to counsel, and extended the terms of reference to the counsel. In my view, this Bill is the result of what the counsel said to the Government. In bringing it to this place, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has acted with a great deal of integrity and with the highest of probity as I and the Government did on this whole matter right through from the Budget deliberations of last year to the present moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I do not want to delay the House unnecessarily. I would like to address some of the issues raised and put on the record my thanks to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) for his contribution. He was the Minister at the time of carriage of the Government's decision. I want to address my remarks to the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who last night indicated that he thought the Government had acted illegally deliberately. As the honourable member for Cunningham has said, this is not the case. At all times the Government has acted on legal advice. To suggest anything otherwise is completely incorrect. As the former Minister has already said, he received advice from the Attorney-General's source, a source upon which he was entitled to rely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong suggested that the Government had sought to give advantage to members during the election, particularly to government members. He fails to recognise the fact that the same benefits were available to all Opposition members as well as Government members. Many Opposition members availed themselves of that despite the advice to them from their then leader. The legal advice that we acted on, as acknowledged by the honourable member for Kooyong, was that the decision of the High Court of Australia did not directly in theory determine all of the issues, even the issues such as postage that were before the Court. It was left in doubt regarding postage entitlements following the period covered by the previous Remuneration Tribunal determination. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to point out in this debate that we have to go back to the reference from the Government to the Remuneration Tribunal in 1989. When the Government referred certain matters to the Remuneration Tribunal, on 20 July 1989 from my understanding, postage was not part of the referral. Therefore, when the Remuneration Tribunal report came down on 16 November 1989 there was no postage entitlement in it. In essence, postage was then treated as many of the other items that now appear in the schedule are treated. The Government asserts that it acted at all times legally and has made a determination on postage similar to that which it has made to Opposition office-holders and members of parliament in items not covered in the Remuneration Tribunal's reports. That is the key point of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason this piece of legislation is before the House now is that many other items, other than postage, are now perceived to be not covered by legislation. Therefore, it is imperative that this legislation be carried because of all the things that have now been laid bare. Schedule 1, which covers members, and schedule 2, which covers office-holders, are quite detailed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not want to delay this debate for too long. I thank the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) for his contribution. He has been consistent in his view that all governments, be they Labor or Liberal should always uphold Remuneration Tribunal reports. He has been vexatious in that view, particularly in relation to salaries. He has always been consistent on that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address a few of my remarks briefly to the propositions put forward by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) last night. Not being of the legal profession I found the contribution quite enthralling. I think the proposition that the honourable member for Menzies put forward was that in essence we should dispense with most legal opinion and just appeal to the honourable member for Menzies. He would be the fount of all legal wisdom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have the carriage of paying his costs. The honourable member for Menzies in his contribution asked honourable members to be cautious about allowing the Government to set items of entitlements because governments would never be generous. The point of this debate is that the Government has determined an entitlement that is more generous than was previously available. The Government believes that it is the right of members to communicate with their constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the member for Cunningham has said, it is not an uncommon practice in similar parliaments. The United States of America allows members of its House of Representatives to communicate five or six times per annum with their constituents. In the Canadian lower House it is three times per annum. The Government allowed members of Parliament to communicate once per annum with each constituent at a discounted rate-not even at the full postage rate. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to point out, by way of introduction, after dealing with clauses 1 to 14, which we are taking as a whole, we will then deal with the proposed amendments to the two schedules. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the sensitivity which I can feel across the chamber from the former Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), in that he believes he acted properly; but he must understand our belief. Firstly, we believe that the Remuneration Tribunal handed down a determination and that it was illegal for the Government to interfere and significantly increase the postal allowance to $30,000. Through the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) we took action before the High Court on this issue and were adjudged to be correct. The High Court, by five to nil, decided in favour of the honourable member for Menzies' action and deemed the lifting of the postal allowance to $30,000 to be illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> After that decision was announced the then Minister nevertheless issued a press statement which said, `Notwithstanding that decision, spend, spend, spend'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr West" NAMEID="XJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr West</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the basis of the AG's advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that it was on the basis of the advice of the former Attorney-General, and that says as much about the former Attorney-General's advice as it does about the Minister's decision. The fact is the High Court said it was illegal and no matter what the advice of anybody else was, including the Attorney-General, the Minister said, `Spend'. He said, as he has confirmed today, that he had advice which allowed him to do that. Yet we have a Bill here today which is based on advice which says that so many other things are illegal. He cannot have it both ways-unless the Minister got a form of advice that suited him before the election campaign and then wanted another piece of advice later which was to the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that only one thing was determined to be illegal and that was the increase in the postage allowance. All these other elements in this Bill which the Government alleges are now possibly illegal have not been found to be illegal at all. Only the postal allowance has. That is all that had to be dealt with. Yet this smokescreen of a Bill has come in, very sloppily drafted in ways that I referred to last night, occasioning the sorts of amendments that we will seek to make here today. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go through them very quickly. I see the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) in the chamber and I would say to him that we look to him to assist us in carrying these amendments to reduce the postage allowance to $9,000. The first amendment which I have moved removes the definition of what is termed in the Bill `Parliamentary Officer' and replaces it with the term `Parliamentary Office Holder'. I seek to do this for the simple reason that the latter phrase is the one that is constantly used by the Remuneration Tribunal. It will therefore introduce certainty into the meaning of this phrase. It is a good example of how sloppily this Bill has been drafted that different terms are used. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment 2 seeks to delete clause 8 (2) as it is open to argument that it could have the effect of removing an obligation to repay moneys spent in excess of that lawfully determined by the Tribunal or by other legislative means. Its removal will not affect any obligation that the Finance Minister may have under the Audit Act. In other words, we are saying that if people have spent more than what the High Court has decided is the legitimate amount, then they will pay it back. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of amendment 3 is simply to reverse clause 10 (1) as it is presently drafted, so that in the event of any inconsistency between the Tribunal's determination and regulations introduced by the Government, the former will prevail. In other words, the Government is saying, `If we want to issue a regulation, that will override any Tribunal determination'. We believe that to be wrong, that the Tribunal, having been established, ought to be independent. If the Government wants to change something that the Tribunal determines it should do it by way of legislation through this Parliament rather than by a form of subordinate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment 4 complements amendment 3, and clause 10 (2), by reason of amendment 3, becomes redundant. Amendment 5 introduces a new section 7 (a) into the Remuneration Tribunal Act. It is alleged that if the Tribunal makes a determination in 1988, for example, and then it does not address the question in its determination in 1989, there is some doubt as to whether the 1988 determination continues. We are essentially saying that unless and until there is a change, a determination from the Tribunal runs on. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to amendment 6. The Government has attempted to retrospectively validate the increased allowance of approximately $30,000 for members and $9,500 for senators and these specific amounts are referred to in clause 14 (2) and in schedule 1, part 1, item 3. Those amounts are simply substituted by us in this amendment. It reinstates the amount of $9,000, the amount determined by the Tribunal in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Chair, I do not want to delay the house at any great length. I have just explained these amendments. Essentially, the crux of our argument in this committee stage is to say: take the postal allowance back to $9,000; that was the amount determined by the Tribunal. The Government's wish to increase it to $30,000 is at variance with the Tribunal's determination. Secondly, to not provide, as the Government has in this Bill, that any regulation made, if it is inconsistent with the Tribunal's determination, should override the Tribunal's determination. It should be the reverse. The Tribunal's determination should override any whim of the Executive. If the Government is seeking to change these things it should bring them into the Parliament by way of legislation. I would urge the House to see the wisdom, the sense and the honesty of these amendments, which are founded on principle and, in addition, seek to clarify some sloppy drafting at the same time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government will oppose all the Opposition's amendments. Opposition amendment No. 1 fails to recognise the legitimacy of the continuing functions of parliamentary offices-holders when they individually cease to be members. On a dissolution of the House of Representatives or the Senate a person ceases to be a member. That same person may, however, continue to undertake the function of a parliamentary office-holder. In doing so it is appropriate that the entitlement attaching to that position continue while the obligations continue. If the Opposition amendment were to be passed by this House, its own leader and deputy leader could cease to be eligible to receive the entitlements covered by this Bill during an election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, should a senator who is a parliamentary office-holder retire from the Senate in order to stand for election to this House all such entitlements would also cease. Clearly, the result of the Opposition amendment is inappropriate and cannot be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has proposed that clause 8 (2) of the Bill be deleted. The clause is a technical provision which is part and parcel of the validation provision. Accordingly, the Government opposes the Opposition amendment No. 2.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to cover Opposition amendments Nos 3, 4, and 5. The Opposition amendments would effectively delegate to the Remuneration Tribunal a far broader range of cover than it has traditionally exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> While the existing subsection 7 (4) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act provides the Tribunal with the power to initiate considerations of entitlements incidental to remuneration issues before it, the Bill before us encompasses a wide range of entitlements that have not previously been referred to or determined by the Tribunal. In addition to this, despite the existence of this power the Tribunal has in practice rarely used it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition seeks to go further than this. It proposes that the role of the Parliament as the ultimate scrutineer in the process be usurped by the Remuneration Tribunal. It proposes that, firstly, the Remuneration Tribunal have the power to initiate its own inquiries in relation to entitlements covered by this legislation and, secondly, that the Tribunal have the power to override entitlements determined by the Parliament by regulation. This represents an unacceptable delegation of the Parliament's responsibilities and powers in relation to its own functioning. This is an inappropriate reversal of the position and the role of the Parliament. It means that the Government must oppose Opposition amendments 3, 4 and 5. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1989 the Government decided that the postage entitlement of members of the House of Representatives should be substantially increased. The Government recognised that members were restricted in their capacity to communicate with their constituents. As I quoted before, for example, in the United States of America and Canada members of the lower House are provided with means to send mail to their constituents five and three times per year respectively. We also needed to have an enhanced electorate reach. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased entitlement provided by the Government merely gives members the capacity to send one letter each year to each constituent in an average sized electorate. The postage entitlement was calculated on the basis of Australia Post bulk rate mail discount, which substantially discounts the cost of mail-outs. The amount supplied in 1989-90 for members is $30,982 and for senators $9,462. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition proposes that the current entitlement available to members of the House should revert to $9,000. Over 70 members of the House of Representatives had exceeded that amount of $9,000. They exceeded that level because they considered that they had a right to communicate with their constituents on matters which were of mutual concern to them. Accordingly, the Government opposes the amendments moved by the Opposition which seek to restrict members' postage entitlement to levels which are inappropriate to the needs of many members of this House. The increased postage in Parliament is part of a package put in place by this Government to upgrade the electorate office facilities of members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(7) Schedule 1, page 6, Part 1, item 3, omit ``amount of $9,462 in the case of a Senator or $30,982 in the case of a Member of the House of Representatives'', substitute ``amount of $9,000''. </PARA>
<PARA>Albeit amendment (6) relates to the question of $9,000, which I referred to in my earlier address, schedule 1 is also linked in this regard. That is the reason for moving the amendment. We seek to amend schedule 1 by deleting the references to the annual amount of $9,462 in the case of a senator and $30,982 in the case of a member of the House of Representatives, this being the designated sum of postal allowance to be paid as determined by the Government. What we are seeking to do is simply substitute these sums with the sum of $9,000 which, I remind the Committee, is the sum that was determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to delay the Committee but, in speaking to the amendment, I must remind honourable members yet again that this Government was caught with its hands in the till. The Government sought to do something illegal by introducing a postal allowance of $30,000 instead of $9,000. It is not just the view of the Opposition that this was illegal: it was the decision of the High Court of Australia by a judgment of five to nil that the Government's action was illegal. To abide by that we are required to move an amendment to schedule 1, if the Tribunal's determination of $9,000 is to be the amount, as it is the view of the Opposition that it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a grubby exercise. There is no need for legislation if we are to abide by the Tribunal's determination. The legislation will go through this chamber on the numbers. Nevertheless we say to the Government that even if its arguments are correct and it is seeking to validate other measures that are brought down-and we do not believe that was necessary-at least it should hold to the Tribunal's determination of $9,000 and not increase it to $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that the only thing that was found to be illegal was the Government's action over postage allowance. Therefore, we seek to ensure that the Tribunal's determination remains. All the other elements in this sloppily drafted Bill are not necessary. The High Court did not address these issues. Indeed, after the High Court made its decision the then Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), issued a press release saying, `Spend, spend, spend. I have an advice from the Attorney-General that says, ``Notwithstanding this judgment of the High Court the old Lionel Bowen was right and he tells me that you can spend all you like''.'. Of course, after the election was over the ballpark was different. The Government said, `We have another legal opinion'-my dear friend over there, the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), will not give me a copy and I have not received a copy of it-`which calls into question all these other allowances'. I simply say to the Committee: Hold to the Tribunal's determination; regard it as correct, as did the High Court, and continue with the amount of $9,000 and not the profligate figure of $30,000. </PARA>

Schedule 2 amends the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, first by introducing a definition of allowance which may narrow the ambit of the Tribunal's inquiries into such matters and, secondly, by introducing the new subsection 7 (4a), which would remove the Tribunal's power to consider related matters on its own motion when considering--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In essence, this further limits the Tribunal's independence. This has been part of the endeavour to erode that body's capacity to make determinations other than as the Minister for Administrative Services determines. We are opposed to that. We have proffered arguments throughout this debate in support of the Tribunal's independence. This proposal further erodes it. It is the last step in this grubby exercise, which has been grubby from conception and appears to be grubby to conclusion. We do not believe the Minister should so circumscribe the Tribunal. Accordingly, we oppose the schedule. </PARA>

<PARA> That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General be agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA>May it please Your Excellency:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I am deeply honoured to move this motion on behalf of the Government and my Party, and I thank them for the privilege. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his election to the chair. </PARA>
<PARA> I take my place in this House as the member for Richmond, having been chosen by the people of Richmond in the recent election to replace Charles Blunt, the former Leader of the National Party of Australia. The electorate of Richmond which I represent is one of the most beautiful in Australia. It, or at least that part around Byron Bay, was once described by the Editor of the Northern Star as `a gem on the brow of New South Wales'. It has been a place of great dreams: dreams of what the area could become. In the last century the locals believed that if only politicians would come to see the place for themselves they would be overwhelmed by its beauty and potential and would give the townsfolk what they needed. </PARA>
<PARA> As most members of the House have probably not been to the Richmond, I have come to tell them myself. The Richmond has been represented by only seven members since Federation. All of my predecessors were non-Labor. Some of them have left their clear mark on Australian political life. However, I am the first member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) ever to be returned to the House of Representatives by the electors of Richmond. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to be a member of the Hawke Labor Government and I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on leading his government to a fourth term. I believe that Labor is the true and best representative of rural and provincial people. I base that assessment on personal experiences and observations dating from my youth. It was during those political and sociologically formative years that I was critically evaluating the political system and parties and that evaluation determined that conscience and compassion, so integral to family and society, were to be found most responsibly with the Labor Party. I am mindful that the National Party, and its predecessor the Country Party of Australia, has always regarded the Richmond electorate as one of its safest seats. It is its seat no longer and I want to explain why to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I claim a mandate to represent Richmond as a member of the fourth Hawke Labor Government on the basis of a massive swing against the National Party, almost amounting to a vote of no confidence in the National Party's leadership. It was such a large swing that its size took many by surprise. But we knew that the composition and mood of the electors had changed and we were quietly confident. Also very confident were my parents, Neville senior and Ena Mary, and I thank them for the support that they gave to me from my nomination, through my endorsement, during the campaign and after the campaign. I thank them very much. There are lots of other names that I can think of who worked for me during my campaign. However, I have only 20 minutes, or less now, so I cannot, unfortunately, go through all of those. </PARA>
<PARA> I must thank my branch of the ALP at Mullumbimby which provided the springboard for success. With apologies, I must also thank my scrutineers who worked after the election. They did such a professional job. I pay tribute to all of those who did help in my election. </PARA>
<PARA> I also claim a mandate as an anti-corruption member. Because of the hearings of the Queensland Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct, the Fitzgerald inquiry, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption, people see the potential for political corruption. They no longer trust that the political lobbying process is always fair and even-handed. They have had enough of the secretive arrangements between politicians and developers. They are sick of those who seek advantage through backdoor approaches because their schemes for private gain cannot stand the light of public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> The Richmond is now a highly educated electorate; it is no backwater. People are acutely aware of the problems that arise when there is a potential conflict of interest in people who have political power. I will do all I can in this House to support those who are disgusted with the prostitution of privilege for private gain. </PARA>
<PARA> I also claim a mandate as a pro-environment member. The open slather approach adopted by the Greiner-Murray Government in New South Wales must cease. The beautiful and unique features of the Richmond electorate must be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I also claim a mandate to represent those for whom the Richmond has become the Cinderella electorate of New South Wales because of lack of effective representation. Over and over again I have been told by people from the business sector that representation in the fourth Hawke Labor Government is the best thing that has ever happened to the electorate. I am forced to agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to do what I can to ensure that small business within the electorate is able to prosper. The electorate of Richmond which I represent is one which is experiencing enormous change and, as a result, it is an electorate which is facing a number of problems and experiencing competing pressures. But it is also an electorate with great potential. </PARA>
<PARA> People are voting with their feet. The Richmond is undergoing an extremely high growth rate, passing almost anything else seen in Australia. Many people who have retired have come to live in this lovely environment; so have thousands of young people. However, because of the low industry base, there is a far higher proportion of long term unemployment in the electorate than elsewhere in New South Wales. Among Aboriginal people, employment prospects are far worse and long term unemployment has reached through several generations. The rapidly growing population has placed enormous strains on what is already a debit in terms of job opportunities. His Excellency outlined the Government's intention with regard to job search skills and training. I will be working with my colleagues to be creative in providing a supportive infrastructure in terms of continuing work opportunities within the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the electorate a number of indigenous industries are emerging. It is my intention to consult with those involved in such industries, to explore how new markets might be found and, where appropriate, to investigate the potential for secondary processing within Australia in order to improve the industry base within the electorate. Such industries include tea-tree oil production. This is an example of an industry in which secondary processing is carried out overseas but which might readily be carried out in Australia. It is important that both State and Federal governments work together to ensure that industries with such potential are given the encouragement that they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> The tourism industry should continue to be encouraged. However, I think there should be increasing emphasis on development which does not desecrate and alienate the landscape but gives people access to what is free and natural. The Richmond electorate has much to offer the world in this regard. The people in the electorate have shown by a clear majority that large-scale noxious development is to be avoided because it spells death to the area. </PARA>
<PARA> One interesting development is the emergence of a more independent media within the region. Gone is the stranglehold which the Budd and Anthony families once had over newspapers within the electorate. Those newspapers have been sold over and over again. As well, a number of small but independent newspapers have been established. These, together with 2NCR FM, BAY FM and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and NRTV, have played a crucial role in bringing corruption to light and acting as a vehicle for the discussion of environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to pay tribute to the Labor Government and particularly to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and his predecessor, Susan Ryan, for what they have accomplished in university education within the region. The former Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education at Lismore languished for development funds until Labor came to government. For years the region had lobbied the conservative governments, through their local National Party representative, for capital works moneys. Those moneys did not flow until the Hawke Labor Government made them flow. Successive Labor governments have followed that college through and now on the East Lismore site, the University of New England, Northern Rivers, stands as a reminder of this Government's commitment to higher education and to opportunities for access to education for people of the region. I pay tribute to the Minister for making that happen. Of course, there is more to be done. But the foundations have been well and truly laid. Not only has the university provided access to career paths for young people who previously would have had to leave the region to obtain university education, but also it has had an enormous impact on the local economy, revitalising the city of Lismore. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, and in the view of many others, there is a need for a branch of the University of New England to be established in the Murwillumbah area in order to service the needs of the rapidly growing population of the Tweed. Without public transport between the centres, the unemployed, the poor, and the women are among those who select out from making the two-hour journey to Lismore. The journey and accommodation difficulties preclude them from enrolling in the university's program lest they become a financial burden on their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The good work commenced by the Minister should speed up cross-credentialling between the technical and further education and the university sectors. My own hope is that this will result in the creation of further career paths for people, both young and old, within the Richmond electorate. The question of how other community-based training would receive recognition is one worthy of investigation. Many people, particularly older people, baulk at the prospect of getting back on the education ladder if they have left school for some reason at an early stage. Many of those people have been working in the community for years, some as volunteers, undertaking training which no formal institution is prepared to recognise. It seems such a waste of talent. I would be glad to place some of my ideas in this area before the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Transport continues to be a major concern within the electorate. There is not a member sitting in this House who does not feel for those people whose families were decimated by the tragic bus accidents so recently reported. However, it seems an irony that the highway is becoming more and more choked with fast moving buses and trucks when at the same time the New South Wales Government is running down the railway system. The Northern Star in Lismore only yesterday expressed its concern. The editor stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A political patch-up job is being done on the railways of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The editor went on:</PARA>
<PARA> What does not seem to have seeped through to the State Government is that rail could have a great future, both as a freight and passenger service. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that road transport is cheaper is full of holes, chiefly because road transport companies do not pay the full cost of the carriageways on which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxpayers pay for the roads-at a considerable advantage to transport companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In rail, taxpayers have a huge investment. </PARA>
<PARA> But this investment has been turned by successive governments into an advantage for no-one. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of kilometres of this State's rail system are being under-used simply because few politicians have had the vision to know they can be used properly. </PARA>
<PARA> The cock-eyed thinking goes that if rail loses money, then it cannot be regarded as a going proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Never mind the massive capital investment which has been going on for more than a century. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that politicians don't really believe in the future of rail. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to place on record that I do. When the railway line was opened from Lismore to Murwillumbah in 1894, it was jokingly called `the line from nowhere to nowhere' by quite a number of members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. The present Greiner-Murray Government in New South Wales has cut back services to the extent that the line is the constant subject of rumours about its impending closure, followed by denials and then further rumours. Something must have escaped me because I am unable to comprehend the logic of a State government cutting railway services when at Lismore and Murwillumbah they have a railway network in place in an area which is one of the fastest growing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no effort to encourage trade to leave the highway and move onto the trail. I urge the Minister to use his best offices to attempt to influence the New South Wales Government to look at a better freight and passenger interchange at Murwillumbah. This would need to be accompanied by improvements in railway services and incentives for freight and passengers to leave the highway. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that considerable attention needs to be given to the Pacific Highway by State and Federal governments, together with other alternatives which might be considered. Nevertheless, it is unthinkable in the view of the overwhelming majority of people in the Richmond electorate that rail services should remain in their present run-down condition. I welcome the plan foreshadowed by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) to develop a national competitive railway freight system. </PARA>
<PARA> While speaking about the Greiner-Murray Government's strange logic, I feel compelled to refer to the appalling interference by the New South Wales Minister for Education and Youth Affairs, Dr Metherell, in education. I refer, in particular, to page 1 of yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald. The interference, as outlined by the State Education Minister, broadcasts to all the nature of the chasm between the philosophy of education held by the Minister and 60,000 State school teachers in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The attainment of social goals and technical and academic skills by our youth, our school students, is all part of enabling them to become complete people. It enables them to respond to life's challenges and changes and, indeed, enables them to respond to adversity. To remove social goals from education in any sphere is to challenge society at its grassroots-the individual and the family. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to conclude by paying tribute to the courage and fortitude of the people of Nyngan at this time when they are attempting to overcome the ravages of a disastrous flood. Perhaps no amount of flood-proofing or mitigation could have diverted such a volume of water in that situation. The people of Richmond electorate have a flood problem of a different magnitude. At Murwillumbah, levee banks erected have kept water from the central business district during flooding of the Tweed River on all except one occasion in the last 20 years. On the other hand, in Lismore the central business district has been inundated on a number of occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Minister to examine closely the study of the Wilson and Richmond rivers which is being carried out at present by a firm of consultant engineers. If it can be established that a flood mitigation scheme could give a measure of flood protection to Lismore without increasing flooding in the rest of the valley, then agreement might be able to be reached among the three tiers of government for implementing the plan. Briefly, these are some of the objectives which I propose to pursue in the interests of the people of Richmond and, in the light of my earlier discussion, in the interests of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I second the motion. I am honoured to second this motion moved so ably by my colleague the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). I may add that on top of his magnificent achievement of snatching the seat of Richmond, he almost reached the heights of being Prime Minister on his first day in this building. I remind colleagues of the first Caucus meeting where unfortunately, or should I say fortunately, the chairperson of Caucus did not accept the nomination. Such a meteoric rise would have made even the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) envious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join with the honourable member for Richmond and other members in congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your re-election as Speaker of this House. During my short time in this place I have observed that you discharge your duties fairly and with good grace. I know that you will continue to bring great respect to the high office you hold and I assure you of my continued cooperation during my time in this place. I also congratulate the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees on his re-election. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to my colleagues for allowing me to make my first speech so soon after my arrival and for the opportunity to second this motion. It is a privilege as a new member to enter the Parliament as part of a government with such a comprehensive and visionary package of proposals outlined on Tuesday by His Excellency. These will continue the work of building a fairer and more compassionate Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> I stand before the House today, like the honourable member for Richmond, as the seventh member to represent the seat of Moreton since its creation in the first Parliament of 1901 and as the first Labor member to represent this seat since 1906. I thank the people of Moreton for their trust and support and the opportunity to participate in the governance of this great nation of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable members will appreciate, to achieve such a task requires enormous hard work and dedication from a vast range of people, to whom I am indebted. I am only able to claim my seat in this Parliament because of the commitment of hundreds of party members and supporters and because of the love and support of my wife Ann, my parents and my children whom, I am pleased to add, are all here with us today. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate of Moreton is an inner city densely populated seat on the south side of Brisbane. It is almost exclusively residential with the relevant commercial and service facilities and a small segment of light industry. The composition of the constituency has been undergoing considerable change during the last five years, particularly with the encroachment of multiple dwellings and greater levels of rental accommodation. It has a higher than average older population with the associated need for greater care, support, housing and nursing programs and facilities to assist this most important sector of our community. The electorate is lacking in a range of community facilities, particularly in the area of recreational or leisure pursuits for young people and older residents. It is also in need of greater levels of public housing, child-care facilities and improved health facilities. It will be one of my major goals to significantly improve such vital community resources in Moreton. </PARA>
<PARA> My election as member for Moreton is the culmination of 18 years of work with the Labor movement through my party membership and union activities. I was drawn to this movement because of my deep philosophical commitment to genuine social justice and a desire to actively participate in the process of social reform. I look forward to my work in this Parliament in advancing that process, particularly in the light of the initiatives outlined in the speech by His Excellency. I am not naive enough, however, to believe that the Parliament or the Government can direct from above the process of social reform. It is vital for the success of any reformist approach that changes come from within the community. The Parliament's role is to enable and encourage the development of new ideas and attitudes and to respond to changing values and demands. </PARA>
<PARA> I am driven by a desire to see our country free from racism, discrimination and bigotry. My fervent hope is for a society where all its citizens enjoy real equality of opportunity, regardless of their race or sex, and where we all respect the rights and life choices of others. We do not have the right to impose our lifestyle on others. But we do have the responsibility to protect those in our midst who do not enjoy the same opportunities or circumstances as ourselves. Any reasonable assessment of the decade of the eighties will show that the Hawke Government has overseen many substantial achievements in social reform. I am proud to take my place in this House as a member of a government with that record. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been indicated by His Excellency in his Speech, there is more that can and will be done. I believe that all of us assembled here, as the citizens empowered with the leadership of our nation, have a number of important questions to face in the decade ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> We inhabit this planet for just a short time and during this brief period we have a duty to leave it a better place than we found it. Mankind is just one of thousands of life forms which share the ecosystem of planet Earth. All of our destinies are intertwined with the plants and animals and the physical environment around us. When we hurt one we ultimately hurt ourselves. Some would have the rest of us believe that we are the only creatures that have a say. They believe that mankind has the right to alter and recreate the physical environment to suit ourselves and that no harm will come of it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have acquired a mentality in this country that says we must continue to develop or our whole society will collapse. We insist on making and buying new things and throwing away good useable items simply because they are old. </PARA>
<PARA> We do the same to our people. Old is not fashionable. Pity the person who loses a job at age 50 for he or she shall be considered too old for re-employment. Yet we complain about the lack of skills that most young people suffer when first seeking to enter the work force. We have lost the practice of the older skilled practitioners passing on their expertise to the young apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other great contradictions in our society that need to be addressed if we are to fulfil our responsibilities to our current citizens and to future generations. I would like honourable members to ponder on just a few of these. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of violence in our society is of great concern to me, as I am sure it is to most members. The incidence of murder, rape, assault and injury in our towns and cities and inside the home increases each year. How we as a society respond to this is a great challenge. Community leaders decry these developments and demand action. Our citizens have the expectation that they should be able to live their own lives free from the threat of physical violence. Yet every day and every night we continue to provide further encouragement of the use of violence. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to develop a non-violent society we need to give our children positive images and models. That is certainly not happening at the moment. Television is the major educator and communicator for children. More than all other forms of communication put together television shapes the attitudes, values and knowledge that children develop. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Children's Television Foundation estimates that an average child views 15,000 hours of television during his or her school years, compared to receiving 11,000 hours of formal education. A pre-school child will have watched 4,500 hours of television before even starting school. They do not read newspapers. Unfortunately, few read books. Television, with its associated videos, is their almost exclusive communications medium. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of this television will be adult shows where the use of violence is often prevalent. Violence is on the news, in many sporting events, in films and television shows and even in cartoons. The theme is portrayed that violence is an acceptable part of society. Children seek role models with which they can identify. They learn by mimicry. Too often that mimicry is violent. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we need to take a very serious look at the way television is shaping the attitudes of our young and decide whether we can continue on the current path of ever increasing violence where I believe television is leading us. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, can we continue to be hypocritical in our own laws? Institutionalised violence such as corporal punishment, which is still in use in Queensland schools, is a form of legal violence against children which should not continue. It is ironic that the punishment for fighting in the school grounds is to hit the offenders a few times with a stick. </PARA>
<PARA> In sport violence amongst players is depicted as normal healthy behaviour and is sometimes lauded by commentators. A man punching a woman in the street is rightfully viewed as having committed a serious crime and deserving severe punishment but if the same man goes home and punches his wife people call it a domestic and do not wish to get involved. We express horror and anguish at a person going berserk, killing people in a public place with an automatic rifle, and we then queue up to pay $10 to watch an American movie star do the same thing on film. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not curb the increased incidence of illegal violence until we cease providing conflicting images and values to our children about the place of violence in our society. Simply increasing the range or type of punishments will not work. </PARA>
<PARA> The abuse of drugs is very much related to the increasing trend of violence. Yet, here again, our society adopts double standards which are very hard for our children to understand or accept. Any drug used to excess will lead to enormous physical and mental damage. Yet some drugs-alcohol and tobacco in particular-are quite legal to use, even to excess, while others are declared illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> Dependence on illegal drugs creates the necessity to engage in criminal activities, often involving the use of violence. I commend the continued action proposed by the Government to combat the drug trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Excessive use of alcohol also creates situations where violence often occurs. In fact, there is a far greater level of violence associated with alcohol than from the procurement or use of illegal substances, particularly in the case of domestic situations and the toll on our roads. Thousands of people die every year on the roads as a result of alcohol use. That is a massive waste in terms of suffering, loss of skills and other social costs. Yet the community at large views excessive alcohol consumption as reasonably normal and often humorous behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Tobacco usage kills more people than illegal drugs, or, in fact, almost all other causes of death. Figures from the Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health show that more than 18,000 deaths a year are caused by active smoking, which is one-sixth of all deaths in Australia. Yet we continue to tolerate its production, distribution and advertising. Smoking costs our community an enormous amount each year. If we were to add up all of the health costs, social security costs because of loss of earning capacity, productivity losses and other social costs I believe they would far outweigh the revenue earned by governments from this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to preach or pontificate with these comments. I merely wish to expose the contradictions which exist and which I feel we have a duty to redress in some way. There are no easy solutions. As a strong advocate for the fundamental principles of freedom and democracy I realise that we cannot succeed by censorship, by control or by force. </PARA>
<PARA> What is important to understand is that every member of our society has a stake in the process of responding to these challenges. It is everyone's problem. The Parliament's role is to provide a framework for the process of finding the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues of violence, drug and alcohol abuse, the road toll and community health costs are all intertwined with contradictory attitudes and rules. Above all, the protection of the physical environment around us is of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA> These questions deserve consideration and debate by all honourable members if we are serious about providing a better society for our children and grandchildren. This last decade of the century may well be our last opportunity. I thank honourable members for their attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. I start by adding my congratulations to you on your re-election to your high office and go a little further and offer you my thanks-and, I am sure, the thanks of the other new members-for the kindness you showed us all in running a seminar for the new members so that we were more easily inducted into this place. Also, I ask you to convey our thanks to the staff of the House for that event.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am delighted that the House has given me the opportunity to make my maiden speech on only my third day in this place. I am honoured to be here as the new member for Aston-indeed, as the first member for Aston from this side of the House. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the extraordinary efforts put in by many people who worked so hard to achieve that outcome. I want to place on record the fact that I particularly value their support. </PARA>
<PARA> Aston is an outer eastern suburban Melbourne electorate. It encompasses most of the city of Knox and the Vermont part of the city of Nunawading. The seat was created in 1984 and has an overwhelmingly young population. It can well be said to be the mortgage belt of Australia because we have more households in Aston paying mortgages than any other electorate in the country. No doubt that was a significant contributor to the large swing recorded in Aston on 24 March. </PARA>
<PARA> Aston is an electorate of hardworking people, often with both husband and wife out in the work force, and there are many hundreds of small businesses there. Aston, which has seen an explosive development of population in the last decade, is deficient in public transport. In the last five years the state of the roads has not kept pace with our needs. In fact, this year alone we have suffered a 48 per cent cutback in road funding. Further, the area lacks much of the infrastructure facilities that one would expect in an area such as that. Schools and child-care places are just not there, yet these things are so necessary for young families. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Aston is named after Tilly Aston, the blind writer and teacher. Mrs Aston was a founder of the library of Victoria's `Association of Braille Writers' in 1894. In the same way that Tilly Aston did some trailblazing in her particular field nearly 100 years ago, I believe that it is now necessary for this country to change its tune and indulge in some trailblazing of its own and come to grips with all of the problems that now surround us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people no longer accept the arrant nonsense and the interminable repetition that, `All will be well and things will come good if we wait', or, `Aren't the figures beautiful?'. The true numerical result of the 24 March election shows that the Government is out of touch, out of ideas and its policies, so doggedly clung to, are manifestly not working. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession that the rest of this country knows it is experiencing is actually homemade. We are now informed that the Government has discovered the virtues of structural reform. I seem to recall it claimed that it had made that discovery a couple of years ago, but not much was done about it in the last Parliament except for a lot of talk. Even now the attitude seems to be that we have plenty of time to continue at our leisure. We will have some committees, we will do some studies and we will think about it. Where is the sense of urgency? Where have the hard decisions been taken?</PARA>
<PARA> The apologists for our nation's present course have been active in recent weeks trying to pretend that inflation and the current account figures are less than terrible and that there is hope of an improvement without even changing the course of economic policy. While, obviously, on occasions it is sensible that one keeps one's nerve, it is obvious that, in the current dire situation, to continue down the track is sheer folly. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the very serious, indeed the appalling, state that this nation is now in I would like to comment on some particular aspects of the Government's agenda, and I will concentrate on just two of the areas where I believe that this Government is failing Australia-areas where I have personally had long and special interests. These are, firstly, the environment, where we need a more commonsense, more consistent approach and a lot less grandstanding; and, secondly, the support of technology which is badly needed to help pull the country back out of its present slide. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about the environment, let me make it quite clear that the environment is not the prerogative of extremists. It is the concern of middle Australia. The environment needs to be addressed in the context of action that is complementary to other activity, a necessity if this country is to survive. We have to address the real environmental problems and not just the symptoms. The vast bulk of our community, of course, most certainly rates the environment as a key issue. However, the people rank it below the economy by a significant factor. This is because most of them have the commonsense to understand that if we are broke we do not have the wherewithal to address the environmental issues properly. The costs of some environmental policies that have been suggested are prohibitive. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody now recognises, I think on all sides of politics, that people want a higher standard of environmental protection. So far, however, the debate has mostly been in the hands of groups who do not acknowledge costs. The real questions for environmental policy are: how much protection is desired, what are we going to pay for it and, critically, can we afford it? Before somebody says, `We cannot afford not to do it', let us define what it is that we actually need to do. I would suggest that most businesses, communities and planners in Australia today, when they are looking at policy in our current climate, will of course focus increasingly on environmental issues, on ways of reconciling our economic policies with sound environmental management. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a recognition in the community of a need for a balance in the environmental debate. I would suggest to the extreme environmentalists that they would be mistaken to underestimate the importance of this change that is now taking place in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we also need to be aware that regulation is not the answer, either. In fact a very strong case exists against environmental regulation as the sole, or even the primary, answer to managing the environment. The industrialised countries with the worst environmental record are those of eastern Europe. Centralised planning of the environment is as big a failure as centralised planning of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, there are real differences in how we can approach this problem. We all acknowledge our concern for the environment, but the green movement must understand that rejection of modern industrialised civilisation altogether is just not acceptable to the average Australian. There is a need to clean up the oceans; there is a need to clean up the air; and there is a need to clean up the rivers. Such a process takes time, and it has its costs. But that does not mean we should not do it and it does not mean that we should not start doing it now. The fact that we acknowledge the reality of the problem on this side, and we do not just adopt blanket bans, does not mean that we do not care. I would reject any suggestion that this side of the House is not serious about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to turn to the use of technology in this country. Everybody understands that we have to export more, we have to import less and we have to be more productive and more efficient in the way that we run our country. The only way out of our present malaise is for Australia to lift its game. We can no longer afford to embrace the status quo in the way that we do things. This means structural reform and dramatically greater support for the growth of local technology and for the everyday use of technology across the spectrum of our endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> We are backwards, as a nation, in our use of modern tools, and unfortunately it is often management that has been more luddite than the trade union movement. Benefits to be gained are often slow in coming, largely because industry in the past has all but turned its back on new technology. But now the electorate out there understands that we have to be more innovative. A great deal more has to be put into the development of successful technologies in Australia and I would suggest that the Government needs to put together a far more meaningful set of enabling conditions for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> At its most basic, this means having a careful look at the way that technology and technological funding are organised. I believe that the time for technology in Australia has to be now. But where are the plans? We heard little about the subject in the Government's program announced on Tuesday, despite the desperate need. There is no present circumstance in which planning is more important than in the development of research and technology. </PARA>
<PARA> May I remind honourable members that the five so-called `Asian tigers' are all countries in which international developers are jostling, yes jostling, to inject risk capital associated with technology. Why is this not happening in Australia? The reason does not lie in the capabilities of our scientists and our technologists; it lies with our failure to plan more than a few short weeks or a few short months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason for Australian industries' head in the sand attitude towards technology is that so many large organisations, of course, have just developed out of low-tech companies. The top people were not able to understand, to comprehend or to talk with technologists. They can talk finance, they can talk the legalities, but they have not been equipped to take the initiative and to look at what needs to be done with technology in their own industries. It is not government's role to do it for them. But government can and government must set the climate and offer incentives for the good of us all. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence for the nation of continuing to ignore, or failing to implement home-grown technology, will mean a future of continuing economic decline and a fall in our living standards. We will lose control of our own country if Australians cannot generate the products and the capital to sustain a healthy balance of payments. We will depend increasingly on foreign investment and foreign capital; on the sale of assets and resources. In other words, we will be selling off the farm. In the end Australia will not belong to Australians. We will plunge into a rapidly self-sustaining downward spiral.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has had much too short an horizon in terms of planning. It has failed to get behind new industries and to provide the conditions in which investors have a reasonable expectation that their investment will flourish. The Government, with its legislative jungle, has been a major impediment to the growth of many businesses and, of course, our multi-layered Federal-State regulations all too often inhibit company development. Companies have to waste far too much time, I regret to say, dealing with the Sir Humphreys of this world. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Asian neighbours who, of course, are our direct competitors in many areas, do not mess around with that sort of thing. They keep their eye on the product and they push and they push and they push that product out into the world. That is something that we have to learn to do. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I say that on 24 March the electors of Aston sent this Government a very clear message. Eighteen months earlier the electorate had accepted the Cain Government's line that it was going in the right direction. Within days of that State election the disastrous economic truth was disclosed. This time they were not prepared to be conned and, of course, what has happened is that since 24 March they have been proved correct. The economic truths in this country have started to come out. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia will not be forgiving of this Government at the next opportunity, and until that time comes it will be my intention to serve the constituents of Aston, but also to prod this Government as often as is required, in an attempt to start to do some of the things that are so necessary for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly conscious that this prodding has to be in many of the areas that daily affect the lives of ordinary Australians. These include the environment, small business, interest rates and taxation, immigration, support for the elderly and support for veterans, and facilities for children and for families, and we need to ensure that real action is taken on the road system. But above all, because so many of these things depend on gettingthe economy right in the first place, the key area of economic management is fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has yet to attend to the essential structural changes necessary to encourage exports and to being efficient in the way that we run our country. One of the most significant actions that it can take to change our situation radically is to improve our technological base and our technological implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> So finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I give the Government notice that I will prod it on this particular subject from now until the next election at every opportunity because not to do so would be negligent and an abuse of the responsibility that I have accepted in coming to this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, first of all may I congratulate the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) on an excellent maiden speech. On a number of occasions this week we have heard calls in this place for a greater measure of political bipartisanship, particularly when the Australian traditions of mateship and national defence are at issue. Before I move on to the specifics of my contribution to this debate today, I would like to add my support to what both the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)-and, indeed, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley)-had to say yesterday in this place about the professionalism, the integrity, the loyalty and the hard work and esprit de corps of our Australian Defence Force personnel, notably their contribution to the recent flood relief operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many forget that the men and women of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force are on call seven days a week, often putting their lives and limbs at risk outside their primary area of national responsibility. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to them here today for another job well done. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to pay particular tribute to one of their fallen comrades-someone who gave his life in the skies above Rabaul Harbour in November 1943; someone whose undoubted heroism remains unrecognised; and someone who became the scapegoat of bureaucratic intransigence and wartime political ineptitude. I speak of the late Squadron Leader Owen Price of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), whose life, whose death and whose Victoria Cross recommendation have been documented in great detail by his friend the late retired Wing Commander Roy Bettiens of Canberra in a report published late last year after 40 years of research. Without Roy's perseverance, his persistence and his sense of irreversible mateship, the facts would not have been documented to the extent that they have been. My only regret today is that Roy is no longer with us to hear his case put forward in this Parliament. I hope that his wife Collie is listening to the broadcast; she has every reason to be very proud of Roy's invaluable contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In this place this morning I presented a petition from several hundred constituents calling for a review of Owen Price's Victoria Cross recommendation and its posthumous presentation. It is also very appropriate that Owen's two sisters, Rosamond and Nancy-now in their seventies and eighties respectively-should be in the Speaker's gallery today, having travelled from Toowoomba to be with us. I welcome them both. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the facts of the late Squadron Leader Owen Price story are as follows: During 1943 Squadron Leader Price was transferred to New Guinea with No. 8 Squadron-a new, specially trained squadron of low-level Beaufort torpedo bombers stationed at Kiriwina under No. 9 Operational Group. Twelve Beauforts were to take off that fateful November night to attack more than 30 Japanese warships stationed at Rabaul Harbour. Ground fortifications and gun placements around the harbour were extreme. The mission required a low-level bombing run at 200 feet in the dead of night, without on-board computers and all the navigational aids available today. </PARA>
<PARA> Just prior to take off a weather plane reported atrocious flying conditions along the flight path and over the target-later said to be the worst ever experienced by the surviving crews. No. 8 squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Geoff Nicholl, elected to cancel the mission because of the extreme risks and relative inexperience of his men in night torpedo bombing. However Roy Bettiens reports that the No. 9 Operational Group's air officer commanding, Air Commodore Hewitt, insisted the mission go ahead and threatened relieving Nicholl of his command if it did not. </PARA>
<PARA> Nicholl, reportedly spurred by accusations amounting to cowardice, elected against better judgment to take three aircraft flown by himself and his two flight commanders-Squadron Leader Owen Price and Flight Lieutenant Noel Quinn-and then only if they volunteered. And they did. The mission was later labelled by RAAF pilots in New Guinea as `suicidal'. For their part in the mission Quinn and Nicholl were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. It was Air Commodore Hewitt himself, having observed the attack, who wrote the recommendation for Squadron Leader Price to be awarded the Victoria Cross. Hewitt wrote in part that Price `could not have behaved, in my opinion, with greater gallantry and honour'. But the recommendation was never acted on. Price was remembered only with a mention in dispatches. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was Price not awarded the VC or even remembered officially in history as ever having been recommended for one? Roy Bettiens claims the mission on which Price lost his life was backgrounded by `seething rivalry' and `animosity' among senior RAAF officers caused by the political appointment of Air Vice-Marshal George Jones to be Chief of the Air Staff above more senior men. Hewitt, pressured by Jones, arguably had a `burning desire' for immediate results to politically justify expense on the torpedo bombers and to dispel continuing United States criticism of their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Roy Bettiens was convinced that Price was robbed of his VC to avoid risk of journalists uncovering embarrassing flaws and deficiencies in the command, the control, the direction and the administration of the RAAF in the Pacific at the time. Bettiens says in his report:</PARA>
<PARA>In plain words, Squadron Leader Price has been most unfairly denied posthumous award of a VC for which he was entitled and recommended; all done in the interests of expedience, humbug and other forms of hypocrisy. Price's cause was also damaged by some who gave bad advice to others or gave unsatisfactory decisions on important aspects; often indicating there were serious deficiencies in personal qualities. The broadening of this involvement is justified by the indisputable fact that the decisions to deny Price a VC were taken by Australians charged with national responsibilities, so the righting of injustices they perpetrated becomes a national responsibility. Admittedly the responsibility for righting the wrong that was done to Price's memory, and for which there has been no attempt by other than this writer to put it right, rests most heavily on the elected parliamentarians; regardless of their political party affiliations, of their status in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>One should look for something of importance in the shadows extending away from the hoped-for approval of the posthumous award of a VC with a sense of sadness not related solely to the loss they sustained with Owen's death, but a subconscious awareness that somehow there was something not quite right-in fact mysteriously wrong-with the manner in which his outstanding heroism was denied the form of official recognition they could have reasonably expected. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, in my view, a favourable review and award of a posthumous VC, even at this extremely late stage, would bring a calming consolation to Owen's widow, Ethel; his sisters, Nancy and Rosamond; and his brother, Harvey. Their longstanding sense of uncertainty about the high honour which they reasonably and rightly, in my view, believed should have been publicly acknowledged for Owen's death in such heroic circumstances would be swept away. That well-deserved recognition would be recorded in terms they have always felt was only right and proper. With this dispersal of that cloud of mystery, which has so long enveloped all the strange-even seemingly improper-ways in which the Price VC recommendation was so unfairly dealt with, Owen Price's relatives could, at last, know that Owen died in such a gallant fashion that his name will now be accorded a well-deserved place among Australia's national heroes, and the Australian public will know of his bravery. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I have written to the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, seeking an urgent review of Owen Price's Victoria Cross recommendation. A posthumous mention in dispatches also would appear appropriate for Owen's brave crew members, Flying Officer Harrison and Flight Sergeants Allan and Hooper. I am hopeful, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the new spirit of bipartisanship and fair play I referred to earlier will in fact prevail. </PARA>

I amend my first statement: the biggest secret known to some men is that of their own stupidity. On the other hand, the greatest farce of all is the one that is perpetrated by a seemingly reasonable man knowingly setting out to confuse the rest. We have all known this type of man. In one way or another we have all encountered, suffered, shrugged off or cursed this oh so blameless person. But when this fool dares to spread confusion in my electorate by presuming to put words in my mouth, then I do not suffer, shrug or curse and I do not bite my tongue and hold my peace-I speak out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 8 March in the lead-up to the recent Federal election, the Biggenden Weekly printed two articles-one an interview with me on funds rip-offs in Queensland, the other an interview given by Councillor Alec McIntosh of Goomeri, a member of the State Grants Commission and Vice-President of the Queensland Local Government Association. At a local government conference Councillor McIntosh claimed that my exposure of National Party State rip-offs was misleading and short on facts. I may add, Mr Deputy Speaker, that his comments were supported by five other shire chairmen. I guess that if I were a more lenient man I might have accorded the good councillor credit for the way in which he so skilfully manipulated the facts. If I were a more lenient man I might even have ignored the deposed National Party State Government's skilful manipulation of Federal funds as well. But then again, I am just a farmer. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for niceties. Councillor McIntosh is either a liar or a fool. As a member of the State Grants Commission and Vice-President of the Local Government Association, Councillor McIntosh would be fully aware of the National Inquiry into Local Government Finance conducted by Professor Peter Self. The Self committee highlighted that:</PARA>
<PARA>There is evidence that not only has the Commonwealth general purpose assistance led to a reduction in the real level of assistance to local government by those States-</PARA>
<PARA>and he highlighted Queensland-</PARA>
<PARA>but, for their own budgetary reasons, by increasing the taxes, duties and so on, that impact on local government of these States have further diminished the real resources available to local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>These facts are not mine; they come from the recognised and respected Self inquiry. If one continues this analogy from the 1982-83 financial year to 2 December 1989, bearing in mind the figures originally go back to 1976-77, one can conservatively estimate that over $100m was ripped off local government in Queensland by the former National Party State Government in transfer charges. </PARA>
<PARA> On 22 February 1988 I raised this matter in Federal Parliament and yet Councillor McIntosh and other shire chairmen-Councillors White, Hockey, McIvor and Webster as well as Councillor Bill Roberts-pretend that they are unaware of this blatant rip-off of their own local government in Queensland by the former discredited and corrupt National Party State Government. It is no coincidence, though, that all these gentlemen are supporters and members of the same discredited and corrupt National Party and are prepared to both lie and neglect local government in order to protect their own political party to the detriment of their own ratepayers. If any of these men had any decency they would resign from their position because, in the Westminster tradition, this would be required of any member of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> However the saddest aspect of all in the road debate, one that I am very sad and appalled by, is the way in which the executive of the former respected organisation, the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ), has also been prepared to lie and misuse members' funds for their own biased National Party agenda during the Federal election campaign of 1990. For a formerly respected organisation that has as its patron His Excellency the Honourable Walter Campbell, Governor of Queensland, a man of high integrity, the actions of the RACQ executive officers have been nothing but shameful. Throwing all integrity and ethics aside, the President, Mr A. J. Love, the Senior Vice-President, Mr M. J. Sargent, the Junior Vice-President, Mr R. F. D. Ashton, the Treasurer, Mr D. R. Barnett and the sleaziest of all, the Secretary and Chief Executive Officer, Mr N. J. Mason, the man who authorised these advertisements, blatantly used RACQ membership funds to campaign against marginal Labor members and support the conservative parties in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be stretching credibility to the extreme to believe that these so-called learned and intelligent men would be unaware of the same rip-offs that the former National Party Government perpetrated on local government, as was highlighted in the Self report. After all, their job is roads and the funding of local government. Yet never once did they come out and criticise the former corrupt National Party of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Never once did they or the National Party shire chairmen so mentioned in this speech stand up and fight for the $100m plus that local government has lost-money, I may add, that could have been injected into the road system in Queensland. With self-righteous indignation these hypocrites that represent the RACQ in Queensland have used members' funds to support the corrupt National Party of Queensland and in so doing, very sadly, have denigrated a once great and respected organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my wife is a member of the RACQ and as such part of her moneys were used in a blatant political campaign against me. It would seem that the National Party and National Party supporters, regardless of whether they be chairmen of shire councils or executive members of organisations such as the RACQ, have no shame, no principles, no integrity or honour, and are prepared to lie or cheat or use whatever means are available to promote their own political ideologies. </PARA>
<PARA> One would hope that the destruction of communism in eastern Europe and the exposure of corruption in Queensland through the Fitzgerald Commission of Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police Misconduct would help in some way to change this mentality. They have not just slurred their own credibility and reputation; they have brought into question the very fabric and repute of leaders of local government and the once non-political, respectable and accountable RACQ. Were any company so blatantly used as the RACQ was during the Federal election, the shareholders would be demanding the removal of their directors. Until the RACQ sacks Messrs Love, Sargent, Ashton, Barnett and Mason, it will have no credibility and will be tainted as being a front for the scandal ridden National Party of Queensland. I call on all members of the RACQ to come forward and throw out the executive of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I also believe that a letter should be written to His Excellency the Governor of Queensland calling upon him to withdraw his patronage from the RACQ and thereby dissociate himself from an organisation that utilises its members' funds to further the aims of a political party whose actions in the past have been publicly shown to be less than admirable. Accordingly, I shall be doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this grievance debate about the forgotten people of this country-those who make a major contribution to our economy, who serve the needs of the community and who provide the very livelihood for a substantial number of Australians. I refer to the small businessman. For the information of the House, a small businessman is generally regarded as one who independently owns and manages his or her business; who has contributed most, if not all, of the business capital; who has the principal decision making responsibilities; and who employs up to 20 people or, in the case of a manufacturing firm, up to 100 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some 600,000 small businesses currently operating in Australia. However, if we include those small businesses operating in the agricultural sector this figure rises to around 750,000. Indeed, small businesses account for some 95 per cent of all firms operating today. Their economic contribution is great. They generate some $120 billion in revenue, or a third of the total revenue, and are responsible for around 40 per cent of all value added. In terms of employment, the small business sector accounts for just over one-half of the private sector employment and one-third of all total employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that this Government does not recognise the significant contribution made by the small business sector, and fundamental to this is its lack of understanding of the requirement to distinguish between the needs of small and large business-an understanding which we, on the coalition side, are fully conversant with. To the contrary, the Government lumbers small business with the same demands and burdens which it imposes on the large multinationals which have a greater capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the burdens of small business can all too readily be seen. Business bankruptcies are once again on the increase. In the March quarter alone bankruptcies rose by a huge 27 per cent compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. In Western Australia, my home State, bankruptcies have increased more dramatically-by a massive 75 per cent over the same corresponding period. In Tasmania the increase was 52 per cent, Queensland 36 per cent and Victoria 33 per cent. This is an appalling indictment of the Government's economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The bankruptcy figures I have just quoted do not include small business failures and voluntary closures. While the Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect this information, anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of businesses voluntarily closing before bankruptcy is reached is as high as 47 per cent. A. J. Williams is his study, The Characteristics and Performance of Small Business in Australia, found that of his sample of some 10,750 small businesses, 47 per cent failed and closed within three years of establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> The cause of the problems and subsequent closure of small business can primarily be attributed to the policies of this Government. The Government's deliberate high business interests rates policies are bleeding small businesses dry. We can forget last years record high interest rates when small businesses paid up to 24 per cent on their borrowings and, in the case of overdrafts, the rate was significantly higher-up to 26 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's recent easing of monetary policy has resulted in a small drop in interest rates but this is long overdue and may be too late for many. Indeed, at current rates many small businesses are still paying interest on borrowings at rates between 18 and 20 per cent and up to 24 per cent on overdrafts. The easing of monetary policy and a subsequent slight drop in interest rates is seen by the Opposition as being too little, too late. It will not stop the slide of many overstretched small businesses into voluntary closure or bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Government's policy has been twofold. Firstly, it has substantially increased interest payments on borrowing, reducing the cash flow of the business and the ability to reinvest and expand that business. Secondly, it has resulted in a reduced household disposable income, reduced demand and a shrinking market. This is borne out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics retail trade statistics. These figures show a decline in spending in retail stores of around 0.4 per cent per month. </PARA>
<PARA> Business proprietors are having to work increasingly harder just to survive. In many cases they have cut back their costs as far as they possibly can. They are reducing staff and shouldering the additional burden themselves. But, in spite of this cost cutting, the small business proprietor is still facing high wage costs, lease payments, interest payments and rent and must meet all of these costs from the proceeds of a shrinking market. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of large corporations going into receivership is also having a severe impact on small business. Many of these firms provide the market for the products and services of small businesses. Likewise, many small businesses are the outlets for the actual produce of the large corporations or have responsibility for servicing its products, often as agents or franchise operators. As an example, I refer to the recent closure of a large business, the Goulburn based McFaddens Garages, which has been placed in receivership. Because of the closure of the main plant, eight small businesses which were the main outlets for the McFadden product were also forced to close. </PARA>
<PARA> Business regulations and their compliance impose substantial time and cost burdens on small business. Indeed, the collective cost of business regulation has been estimated to be between $23 billion and $46 billion per annum. The sheer volume and high cost of business regulation have been recognised by my opposite number, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), in the report by the parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology titled Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>They-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the small business sector-</PARA>
<PARA>suffer substantial but unqualified costs as a result of over-regulation and oppressive administration. </PARA>
<PARA>May I say that it is refreshing to find a Minister in the present Government bold enough to admit that the Government's oppressive and over-regulatory policies exist. But I am also sympathetic with the Minister, who is but a cog in the machinery of a government which has scant regard for small business, a government which is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me list, for the benefit of the House, the tax burdens currently imposed on business. They include income tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation, capital gains tax, sales tax, customs duty, State payroll tax, State land tax, and local government rates and taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The rapid growth in the size and complexity of our taxation law, the complex and often uncoordinated administrative systems which support it and the associated compliance and reporting costs are particularly onerous on small business. Indeed, a survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicated that approximately 70 per cent of total cost to small business of complying with government paperwork is associated with filling in government taxation forms. </PARA>
<PARA> But, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government is not satisfied with the extent of its taxation burden. It is living up to its reputation by imposing two new tax burdens. I refer, of course, to the training levy and the proposal of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to bring forward the payment of company tax. The proposed training levy is the brainchild of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). He proposes to extract a levy from all businesses with payrolls greater than $200,000 or, in most cases, firms who employ about eight people. This levy, to be one per cent of the total payroll in the next two years, rising to 1.5 per cent in the following years, will be on top of the present range of labour on-costs. This represents another burden which, quite frankly, the small business sector just cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business needs to be nurtured and cared for and then allowed to blossom into its full potential-something which will never happen under the oppressive policies of this Government. The former Finance Minister, Senator Peter Walsh, warned in a recent interview that `Time is running out for Australia'. Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say that time has all but run out for Australia's small business sector-the backbone of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise today to inform the House about a matter which I believe is of considerable concern to apple producers in Australia. For many decades Tasmania was known as the apple isle and, although the industry is perhaps less significant than it was in the forties and fifties when it was the backbone of the rural economy, it still has significance. Of course, in the remainder of Australia apple growers face the same problem that I will be discussing today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are seeing an influx into Australia of massive quantities of concentrated apple juice product, principally from Chile. The concentrated product that is being supplied from Chile is available at approximately $1.40 a litre compared with a cost of juicing domestically produced apple juice of $2.50 a litre. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of this is that literally tonnes of apples are being dumped. Just the other day a local producer, a Mr Harvey of Cygnet, off-loaded some 80 tonnes of apples because no-one would purchase them. Dumping is not only occurring in southern Tasmania but also is occurring in northern Tasmania. Growers are finding that they are down some 20 per cent in terms of anticipated income and some are doing worse than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Chilean product is available in such massive and discounted amounts is that simply no-one in the United States of America or the United Kingdom will purchase it. This is because the Chilean product has been produced using Alar, a chemical which has been the subject of some real concern and has come under scrutiny recently. Alar is a plant growth regulator used in the production of apples, peaches and pears in certain countries. It slows the growth of apple trees, makes them fruit earlier and also gives apples a healthy shine which makes them attractive to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> For a number of years there have been concerns about Alar. For example, in 1984 concerns were expressed that a breakdown product of Alar, also known as daminozide or unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, may have been carcinogenic. At that time the National Health and Medical Research Council undertook an assessment and concluded that there was no significant health risk to the public. However, in 1989 the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed the cancellation of food uses of Alar. That was done in circumstances in which consumer concerns in relation to Alar use had become widespread. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad consequence for Tasmanian growers is that, because of consumer pressure in the United States, a product which was previously sold from Chile into that market is now flooding into Australia and undercutting local producers. That means that we are seeing a major difficulty for domestic apple growers. Fortunately in Tasmania, the major juicing company, Cascade Fruit Juices, is, I understand, standing by growers and has bought the same quantity of apples this year as last year. Nonetheless, the growers do not only sell to Cascade. They also sell to a number of other juicing companies and, as a result, over the last month, they have had to dump probably what would amount to something like more than 1,000 tonnes of fruit and much more will have to be dumped before Christmas. I understand that regular dumps are being planned over the months to Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian consumers have a legitimate interest in this issue. Although the National Health and Medical Research Council has not to date prohibited the use of Alar in Australia, the companies responsible for its distribution in this country have withdrawn the product. The principal companies, Uniroyal and ICI, have withdrawn the product and I understand that domestic growers are now insisting that all Australian products be Alar free. </PARA>
<PARA> So, in the ordinary course, consumers would be entitled to believe that if they bought apple juice which was manufactured from Australian apples it would not contain the substance Alar. They would be aware that that chemical is no longer used by domestic growers in the production of fruit. However, with the importation to this country of massive amounts of the Chilean product they are probably drinking a very substantial proportion of juice which does contain Alar product. I have very real concerns about there being no necessity for labelling in relation to that; there is also no necessity for the source of origin of the juice to be marked on the packaging. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there has long been a case for insisting that products imported to this country do have source of origin marked upon them. We talk often of people buying Australian but it simply makes it impossible to ask consumers to buy the Australian product if they have no means of discriminating between what is in fact an Australian product and what is not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trade Practices Act, of course, does provide that if one makes the claim that the product is produced in Australia that claim must be true. A person making a false claim in that area can be prosecuted under the Trade Practices Act. But there is no general obligation to indicate the source of any foodstuff or any other product on the market and, therefore, consumers may easily be misled with a product such as apple juice which they would ordinarily expect to come from Australian apples, and why should this not be the case with a country which is so abundantly blessed with that product. So they would think in ordinary circumstances that they were not drinking an overseas product and they would not expect that it possibly could contain chemical residues. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not seeking to manufacture a scare tactic. But I do believe that many consumers would wish to buy a product in respect of which they can be absolutely certain that there is no concern at all. There are people who believe that they are entitled to know whether they are buying chemical-free produce. I think, certainly given the publicity that has been recently given to the product Alar-and it has been subject to much community debate-our consumers are perhaps legitimately concerned they are not being informed by juicing companies which are using the Chilean product and substituting it for a domestically produced product to the detriment of Australian growers. Also, the consumer does not know whether the end product has been produced domestically or from imported product and, indeed, whether Alar has been used in association with the growing of the apples. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the information supplied to me from people in the industry that there is no short term amelioration of the situation. The juicing companies project an even worse year in 1991 with a cut in orders for local growers. The market everywhere is down, demand has dropped significantly and no help is in sight. I understand that there is some action being proposed by growers in relation to dumping legislation. But, members on this side of the House are concerned that the trigger mechanisms for invoking dumping procedures are somewhat, shall we say, on the slow side and that there may need to be some attention given to a further review of the anti-dumping provisions in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept entirely that our international treaty obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the various dumping agreements that Australia is subject to make this a difficult area. But, obviously, when growers are being affected in this way and are having to dump fruit at tips, it is small comfort to them to be advised that there are complexities in this area. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise this point. I hope it is a matter that can be addressed by the Government in terms of food product labelling, what can be done to speed up the review into dumping and whether or not some interim orders in that area might be practicable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, yesterday the House unanimously passed a motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in regard to the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac Day in which he noted, among other things, the undoubted success of the Gallipoli expedition, mark 2, conducted by members of this Parliament, members of the Returned Services League, some original veterans, your good self and others to Gallipoli only a few days ago. Unfortunately, the success of those events could easily have been marred by a series of circumstances which have since been brought to my attention and which regrettably do involve, to some degree, members of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In fact, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that Australia's international standing, the reputation of the Parliament and its members, the success of the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac, as well as the prime ministerial visit to Turkey, could well have been placed in some jeopardy because of the activities of people here, acting perhaps independently of that event but, nevertheless, in a manner which did have a clear linkage with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The background to this sad saga is as follows. A Turkish parliamentary delegation-and honourable members may recall this-visited the Parliament and Australia last year. The delegation was made up of members of the Turkish Australian Friendship Group and they came as guests of the Australian Parliament-I emphasise that point. I understand that they issued an invitation for a reciprocal visit to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who was Chairman of the Australian Turkish Friendship Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament, not unreasonably and in accordance with its normal practice, treated the invitation as an official one and, in due course, all major parties selected their delegates. The Labor Caucus chose only Senator Burns from the Australian Turkish Friendship Group to be a member of that delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is alleged that the honourable member for Herbert subsequently told the Turkish Ambassador that the invitation should be withdrawn because it was not possible for the friendship group to visit Turkey. It appears that he was of the belief that, since the invitation was issued to him as Chairman of the group, all persons in the Australian delegation should therefore be members of that group. As I have outlined, that is not the view of the Parliament and it is not the way we normally carry out our representation in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> This information was evidently passed to the Presiding Officers by the Turkish Charge d'Affaires on the Wednesday prior to the departure of what can only by now be described as the unofficial or perhaps the unwanted parliamentary delegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, back in Turkey the Chairman of the Turkish Australian Friendship Group, a Mr Barlas Dogu, who is also Chairman of the Turkish delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), informed the Australian Ambassador in Ankara that the invitation to an Australian delegation to visit Turkey had been withdrawn. He gave as his reason the activities of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), who was the sole representative of Australia at the recent IPU conference in Cyprus where he amended a resolution on the promotion of peace and security in the Mediterranean region, in the opinion of the Turkish authorities, to their detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> The substance of his amendment was to strengthen the resolution and to identify the need to withdraw all Turkish troops from the island. This had not previously been the language used in United Nations' resolutions on the Cyprus question which had been supported by previous Australian governments, nor was his amendment supported by the vast majority of the Economic Community delegations present. In fact, while it received 306 affirmative votes, there were 219 negatives and 405 abstentions. Clearly, the honourable member's amendments did not have the support of the vast majority of the delegations present. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the outcome in perspective, it should be noted that the vote on the resolution containing the Morris amendment, better known as the amendment of the Australian group of one-which, incidentally, carried with it no fewer than 10 votes-was 595 affirmative, 237 negative and 99 abstentions. I seek leave of the House to table and to incorporate in Hansard the actual lists of votes that took place at that conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following receipt of the advice from the Australian Ambassador that the delegation had been cancelled, the Presiding Officers called in the Turkish Charge d'Affaires and asked for an explanation. It is my understanding that he confirmed both the conversation of the honourable member for Herbert with the Ambassador and the decision taken in Ankara to withdraw the invitation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Naturally, the members of the, by now, `unofficial' delegation were particularly concerned that this unfortunate incident should not be allowed to mar in any way the forthcoming Australian official pilgrimage to Gallipoli. We were most grateful to the Presiding Officers for the representations they had made to the Prime Minister to ensure that members and senators would be included in the prime ministerial party and that the visit would continue on that basis. Subsequently, the Turkish Foreign Minister, hearing of this unfortunate incident, issued a formal invitation for us to be his guests. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that, while some journalists apparently were aware of at least parts of this complex story, it was not aired publicly before Anzac Day. Had the matter become public there is no doubt that the success of the Anzac pilgrimage and the Prime Ministers official visit would have been jeopardised at least to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA> However, now that we have returned and the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac was an undoubted success from both the Australian and Turkish points of view, it is only proper that members of this House should be aware of the circumstances leading up to these unfortunate events. In particular, we have a responsibility when representing the Parliament overseas, especially as delegates to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, IPU or other conferences, not to take upon ourselves the right to initiate actions which could well be to the detriment not only of Australia's standing but also of other colleagues in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter in the full expectation that the honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Herbert will take the first opportunity to give us their side of the story because it is important that they should so do, not only to safeguard their own reputations but also to ensure that unfortunate events such as these are not repeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to canvass an issue of importance to millions of Australians-the issue of petrol prices. It is an issue that weekly tugs at the hip pocket of all Australian motorists as they turn up at the petrol bowsers to fill up their tanks; it is an issue that seriously affects the livelihood of thousands of service station proprietors and their families; and it is an issue that has had and will continue to have a major financial impact on consumer costs and the economy generally. On one hand we have Australian motorists repeatedly confronted by rising petrol prices and on the other we have retail proprietors of petrol faced with falling profits. For some it has got to the point where they have walked away from their businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point out at the very outset that, despite these escalating prices, Australia still has very low wholesale prices of fuel when we compare our country with other developed countries. Of 21 countries recently surveyed by the International Energy Agency, Australia has the nineteenth lowest price. The average of all these 21 countries is 92.3c per litre, and that is the wholesale price. Italy was the highest, at 129.2c; the United States of America was the lowest at 39.6c; and Australia was 55.5c. So we do well in international comparisons, but when it comes to the petrol pump the comparison is not so good. </PARA>
<PARA> There are problems in the industry, but they are not new. The history goes back to the late 1970s when the plight of the service station proprietor was so serious that special legislation was introduced into this House. We had the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. We also had the Petroleum Marketing Sites Act. These statutes provided legal protection for the retailers of fuel from the excesses of the oil companies. They also restricted the number of sites that the oil companies could have. In other words, they divorced, to a degree, oil companies from the retail industry. I would suggest that there are many people out there in the retailing sector who would like to see greater divorcement of the oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years we have had inquiries. We have had recent inquiries by the Prices Surveillance Authority, by the Trade Practices Commission and by the Government's consumer affairs committee. I commend the PSA and the TPC for the excellent work that they have done and continue to do. But I suggest to honourable members that there is need for continued inquiry; that further investigation is warranted. We need to delve more deeply into the wholesale pricing structures that exist; to dig into the company discounting or lack thereof; and also to have a hard look at the discount card system that is being forced on the retailers. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look also at the transport of fuel. If one has a flag site-a company franchise site-one is forced to transport fuel in a company tanker. In one case in central Queensland the proprietor pays 6c a litre to transport the fuel 350 kilometres, but he could do it himself for about 2c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to have a hard look at the rack pricing system because the rack pricing system, whilst applaudable in many areas, has brought about the disappearance of competition. In the last 10 years the oil companies have been restructuring the industry and this has accelerated in the last 12 to 18 months. There have been new franchise agreements, and many of these agreements were so tough that they forced the closure of hundreds of service stations. Ten years ago there were some 12,000 service stations across Australia. In 1990 there are about 7,500 and the predictions given to me show that by 1995 there will be less than 5,000 across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all part of a broad strategy by the companies to reduce the number of retail outlets. Their reason is to increase the volume of sales that they themselves control. They want to maximise the number of prime sites. They also want to reduce their costs by using technology and also cutting back wages. They want to maximise the sales through the company managed outlets. They are also expanding distillate sales by selling outside the distribution network. They are maximising their profits by increasing their wholesale margins and removing competition. All this has had a massive impact on the motorist and also on the retailer. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies have reduced the discount margins to bulk buyers. Once they could buy three or four million litres of fuel and have a discount price, a special margin of 7c and 8c. Now that is down to 2c and 3c. They are also scalping customers that the independents once had by doing deals outside the system-one might say a company to company deal. They are cutting out the independent person who really created the competition. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that there is a hidden agenda, and this agenda includes changes to the Petroleum Marketing Sites Act of 1980 because the companies are pushing to get an increase in the number of their retail outlets. At the moment they control some 430. That is about 5 per cent of all the retail outlets. But through that 5 per cent, on the figures given to me, they are selling some 15 per cent of all petroleum-15 per cent through 5 per cent of the actual sites. When we add to this the direct company to company deals particularly for distillate, that quantum increases significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> On one hand I understand the companies' attitude, because they have sites that are prime real estate. They are expensive. They have had to outlay massive amounts of money for infrastructure and capital costs to develop these service stations. They now demand a higher return on that investment, and I understand that as well. There is also the competition between the companies to provide additional services-restaurants and rest facilities and the one-stop shops that we are seeing. But this pressure for profits, pressure for returns on investments, has created a difficult environment for the retailers, the distributors, the franchisees, and the consumers-the motorists. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies have extremely tough franchise agreements. There is a franchise fee of $10,000 to $20,000. There are significant controls by the oil companies, as I said before, over the transporting of their fuel. But they now have controls over discounting, so these franchisees are forced to give discounts in some cases to 30 per cent of their customers. That is the sort of volume that is now caught up in discounts. They are getting a profit of only 2c to 2.5c a litre when they give these discounts. </PARA>
<PARA> Another large part of their trade involves discount or credit that they must give to their local customers-60 days and 30 days credit. This is also costing them 2c to 4c a litre. So what they are forced to do is increase the cost of fuel to the cash buyer. It is no wonder that we have motorists around Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the other States screaming when they see that the bowser price is 65.9c and 67.9c. They are angry about it. What they do not realise is that the service station proprietor needs 7c and 8c a litre just to stay alive. But because he is forced by the companies to give a discount to the Shell card and the BP card holder, a discount that means that his profit is about 2c a litre, he has to top up the profit margin on the cash buyer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not satisfactory. It is not good enough. We need to have a hard look at that. We need to introduce a system like with Bankcard, where the retailer gets the normal retail price but then pays back a handling fee, a special fee. That could happen here. To make it worse, most of these service station proprietors wait 14 to 21 days for their money. They give the discount because they are forced to and then they wait almost half a month to get their money back. </PARA>
<PARA> The real concern, however, that I have is the lack of competition that exists. I was able to get hold of some figures on the rack prices, the posted wholesale price, that the companies have for all their purchasers. This is for all those proprietors out there. In Sydney, Shell is 61.3c, Ampol is 61.3c, and Mobil is 61.3c. In Brisbane, Shell is 55.19c, and Mobil is 55.19c. If we look at Melbourne, Shell is 59.4c, Ampol is 59.4c, and Mobil is 59.4c. Where is the competition? There is no competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Rack pricing was supposed to give the retailer access to the lowest wholesale price on the day, and what has happened? The prices have been pushed up. I believe there is a need for a further inquiry. I believe we need to bring about divorcement, and that is the key here. We need to change the sites legislation of 1980 to take the oil companies out of the retailing industry. If we do that maybe competition will return. Maybe we will protect the small business people that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) just spoke about, those 8,000 people who are still in the industry, maybe we can start getting some competition back in there so that the motorist can also be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a need for an inquiry. I congratulate the TPC and the PSA for the work that they doing, but the House is going to have to take a hand. I believe that we will have to change the legislation, bring back the sites Act of 1980, and divorce the oil companies from the retailing of petrol. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, to even the most casual observer at the opening of the Thirty-sixth Parliament this week, the Governor-General's Speech, provided to him by the Hawke Government, prompts one very significant question: What has the Government been doing for the past seven years? There was no defined agenda and no clear direction. What we were given indicated the deteriorating social and economic situation in our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from primary industries-which I noted did not rate a mention in the Governor-General's Speech-every area of administration and responsibility received passing reference that was in need of change or in need of attention. This was a sad indictment of failed policies that have contributed to massive debt, a flagging export performance and, tragically, a loss of faith and confidence by our youth in a future facing high levels of homelessness, poverty and a breakdown in the security of our social environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In this grievance debate today, at the commencement of this new Parliament, I direct my comments specifically to one area of major concern to my electorate of Mallee. And, of course, the same situation relates to many others. I refer particularly to the fragility of country Australia's economic and social environment and the heightening concern in small business. This is being aggravated by an untimely withdrawal of many State and Federal government support services at a time of major demographic change. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report commissioned in New South Wales clearly identified interest rates, taxation and labour force costs as the issues having the most negative effect on small business. It has been obvious for years that the impact of small business on economic growth, our level and availability of employment and our general standard of living has not been seen to be of political importance and, hence, it has virtually been abandoned by government. This is despite the fact that 750,000 small businesses in Australia, including primary producers which today account for 96 per cent of all firms, provide to our country 50 per cent of all private sector employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Country businesses are being particularly affected as they suffer additional imposts such as freight and, in many communities, decreasing markets. And I am particularly, in my electorate, witnessing an unprecedented bankruptcy situation. There is a depressing decline in business viability and in our smaller communities this is destroying our commercial sectors and turning many of our small towns into residential centres. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in rural Victoria has increased by 108 per cent in the last five years and this can be closely related to the decline in small business profitability. This Government must immediately react to the report on small business by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Apart from urgent attention to macro-economic issues, the excessive regulation and bureaucratic costs must be reduced and the impact of our capital gains tax must be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when these pressures exist, governments are severely removing and rationalising public services. Programs that have been developed as part of a social agenda-for example, the home and community care program in Victoria to maintain people in their own homes and relieve the pressure on our health delivery systems, or the program to assist the capacity of our disabled people to integrate into the community-are today under severe stress from reduced government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> As local government is abandoned by State and Federal government and left to administer and fund programs developed at the behest of those governments, it is little wonder that this Parliament suffers from a lack of credibility and accusations of political expediency. With government withdrawing their funds, voluntary agencies themselves are unable to cope and perform their vital role.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the list of services and infrastructure that our communities need is endless. That list includes transport, roads, communication and education. But the glaring example of neglect throughout my region is that of health. We, as elected representatives, as communities, have for months now been engaged in frustrating and costly attempts to maintain basic hospital and pharmaceutical services. </PARA>
<PARA> The contraction and indebtedness of our bush nursing hospital system in Victoria is shameful. The loss of these facilities to country communities defies any measure of social equity or responsibility. The removal of State and Commonwealth funding totally disregarded the welfare of country people and highlights the failure of our socialised health system and incompetent State administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask Ministers in this place to respond. I ask them to give their departments the flexibility to meet the needs of individual communities. The answers are simple but they require some political will. We simply need to provide incentives in the taxation system to encourage private health insurance. We need to provide limited public access to bush nursing hospitals. We need to provide adequate financial support to ensure that existing facilities can give equity of care to our aged and the physically and intellectually disabled. For decades local communities in country regions have generously contributed to make government health programs work and expand. This Government does not want to be remembered for their destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in the context of future rural infrastructures, I want to refer to the massive demographic changes that have taken place in our regions in recent years. The assets test and the capital gains tax have left the family home as the only safe tax haven and the prime investment vehicle. An artificially high housing market has developed and this, along with high interest rates, has produced real problems for existing home owners in meeting mortgages and, of course, has excluded thousands of prospective first home buyers from the market. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been few options for low income earners or welfare recipients. But one option that is increasingly being taken up, not only by some city people wishing to retire but by many others, is to seek shelter simply by moving to cheaper housing in isolated and country communities. This trend has developed into a flood and is in itself placing huge strains on the economic capacity of local government to meet increasing service and social needs in a climate of reduced government funding. It is placing strains on families, many of whom are single parents, as their desire for housing, once met, places them, in many instances, without transport to service centres, without basic health delivery services as I have already mentioned and, of course, isolated from normal social and recreational activities. </PARA>
<PARA> At the beginning of a new parliament I would like to be optimistic. But in my 18 years as a representative of my people of Mallee I have never been so concerned as to our future. We must halt the erosion of our youth and skills from rural Australia. The country does offer a potential to improve the lifestyle of our people and to reduce the pressure on our cities. Do not let us squander this opportunity; let us forget the politics and consider the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, in the last minute of the grievance day debate could I just refer to statements made here this morning by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). I am concerned that he has endeavoured to enter the cowards castle and destroy people's reputations under privilege in this place. And he has done it under the guise of a State government transferring funds from local government. I should perhaps ask him to conduct an inquiry in Victoria because the $100m he mentioned in relation to Queensland is small peanuts when we look at the transfers that have taken place in the State of Victoria. I do not know the councillors concerned that he named in this place this morning. But I do believe that it was a shameful attempt to degrade people who, in most instances, are possibly working in the best interests of their own local community. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) on raising the problems that are being faced in relation to imports to this country of apple juice. We are facing the same problems in the citrus industry and it is shameful that the quality controls that we impose on our own products in this country are not being imposed on imported products. It is notable that in this country one has to, as one should, produce brandy from grapes. But there are no similar controls on imported products. Under the regulations and requirements, brandy made from potatoes is allowed to come into this country. I think it is time that the Government took very strong action in regard to our labelling laws in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, yesterday in this House the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) moved a motion concerning the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac Day, and many honourable members made fine contributions to the debate. Today I want to share with honourable members a concern that I have and that is shared by Returned Services League (RSL) sub-branches in the electorate of Throsby. I refer to the sale of replica medals. Medals were awarded to Australian service men and women for service during a period of conflict, and in many cases were awarded for acts of extreme valour. Medals are cherished-they are indeed prized-and they are worn with pride. Witness what happens on each Anzac Day. And, of course, they are handed down in the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to an advertisement from Time Life Books, people can buy these medals, usually for around $130. According to this advertisement I have in front of me, a Victoria Cross can be picked up for $99. We are told in the ads that they are exact replicas with genuine ribbons. I asked about this, because many members of the RSL in my electorate raised the matter with me as they were very concerned about it. I contacted the New South Wales branch of the RSL and was told that the sale of these medals has the support of the RSL. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Colin Hines, who has recently retired, apparently issued a press release a few weeks ago indicating that the RSL did not have any objection to the sale of the medals. I believe Sir Colin also featured on the Ron Casey show in this regard. Sir Colin might not have a concern, but RSL sub-branches such as Warilla, Albion Park, Kiama, Gerringong and Bomaderry as well as the Shoalhaven branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association in the electorate of Throsby most certainly do have a concern. Indeed, I am also very concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to stop people buying these medals and wearing them, indicating that the medals have been awarded to them, especially as the medals are advertised as having genuine ribbons? The RSL in Sydney told me that the medals were attached to a board. Some are attached to a board and others are not, and they can be easily taken off the board. </PARA>
<PARA> I am personally outraged at this money making activity and I am outraged that it should be encouraged. I am puzzled, and indeed somewhat saddened, that the RSL, an organisation that I have great respect for, should give the appearance of encouraging this activity. Basically, it is simply a money making activity. Regardless of how it is dressed up in the publicity, that is what is being done. Replicas of medals which were awarded for acts of valour are being sold to make money. </PARA>
<PARA> These medals are printed on one side only and on the reverse side the word `copy' appears. What would be the feeling if on Anzac Day we went up to the diggers who were proudly wearing their medals and flipped them all over to see whether they were genuine medals or copies? That is basically what we would have to do. We are degrading the worth of those medals that were presented. To add insult to injury, on Anzac Day, 25 April, the Sydney Daily Telegraph carried this advertisement:</PARA>
<PARA>Now available. For 1st time. Gallipoli Star. Originally designed in 1916 for ANZACS but not awarded until now. $65 plus $3.50 P&amp;</PARA>
<PARA>It really is outrageous. People can also obtain, if they fill in one of the little squares at the bottom, medals for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force; medals of World War I, World War II, Korea or Vietnam. These decorations cost $98 plus $8 for certified mail. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) expressing the concern of the RSL sub-branches in the Throsby electorate about this insensitive and insulting practice. I hope the Government will legislate to stop the sale of these replica medals. If the Government will not stop the sale of these replica medals, I will try to introduce a private member's Bill to stop it. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the sale of these replica medals devalues the real medals themselves. It is insulting for those people to whom the medals were awarded. It is illegal to reproduce university degrees and it is illegal to reproduce many other things, but it seems to me that it is not illegal to reproduce medals that were awarded to people, as I said at the outset of my speech, often for extreme acts of valour. Over the last couple of weeks many of us have been reflecting on that, and it seems to me that if the sale of anything should be made illegal in this country it should be the sale of these replica medals. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you on your new role in the House and I must say it was a pleasure to travel with you as a member of the parliamentary delegation to Gallipoli. I rise quite suddenly in this grievance debate to pick up on a brief item which came up earlier in the debate. Before proceeding with that, I point out that I was pleased to note a number of grievances especially those relating to rural unemployment, as mentioned by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), and other matters including the floods which are still yet to arrive downstream in many parts of western New South Wales. Indeed, it is still some four to six weeks before those floodwaters will reach Wentworth in my own electorate of Farrer, where the Darling joins the Murray and moves through to South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are genuine grievances by members, matters I have referred to during this first parliamentary sitting week-a precious sitting week given the fact the House is scheduled to sit for just two weeks in this first seven months of the year. So, on the printed schedule, we will have just seven days sitting in the first seven months of this decade. That is why the grievances raised are important-as indeed are all of the debates and all the maiden speeches, from both sides of the House, especially in the Address-in-Reply debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular matter I want to make passing reference to relates to standing order 74 which says:</PARA>
<PARA>No member may use the name of Her Majesty, her representative in the Commonwealth, or her representative in a State, disrespectfully in debate, nor for the purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a standing order which does not come up very often, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have just had the Governor-General visit the other place for the opening of Parliament. One of the honourable senators over there, Senator Button, might well have offended standing order 74 with his reported comments on the content of the Governor-General's address and what he thought of the occasion and how exciting he thought the occasion would be. I am sure Senator Button, in the context of House of Representatives standing order 74, would be in diabolical trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> I do have a genuine query, Mr Deputy Speaker, which I simply make in passing for the guidance of honourable members and senators. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), whom I have tried to contact in the last five minutes, made passing reference to and brought into the debate the name of His Excellency the Governor of Queensland. I would seek some indication from the Chair, now or at a later stage, for the guidance of honourable members whether in fact that reference contravened the important standing order 74 which, as I said to the House, does lay out very clearly that no member may use the name of Her Majesty, her representative in the Commonwealth or her representative in a State disrespectfully in debate nor for the purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I choose not to make any more or less of it than that. I believe that the grievance debate is essentially for back bench members on both sides of the House. I finish my remarks still leaving time for backbenchers so desiring to do so to participate in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to intervene in this grievance debate today to bring up a matter of concern to my electorate; that is, the question of ocean pollution. Honourable members from eastern Australia would be aware that there is a real problem in the city of Sydney with respect to the ocean dumping of sewage. In Western Australia the Metropolitan Water Authority also dumps sewage into the ocean. I should make the point that it is a question of whether or not it is primary or secondary treated sewage. Largely, it is a matter of the Metropolitan Water Authority dumping both primary and secondary treated sewage into the ocean.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am considerably concerned that at present there is a proposal to expand the amount of sewage dumped into an area adjacent to my electorate in what is called the ocean reef outfall. That area is, in fact, part of Marmion Marine Park and, as such, it has some important status bio-logically, scientifically and in recreation terms. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is anyone in the Australian community who would feel comfortable about knowing that we are extending ocean dumping of sewage. It is my view that we ought to be more creative about alternatives. I think it is sad to visit Sydney and find that many beaches there are now not usable by members of the public. It is an issue that has to be addressed in Sydney at great expense. But it is an issue that can be addressed in other cities of Australia without such great expense. </PARA>
<PARA> Perth regularly uses water obtained from very large basins underneath a significant sand plain adjacent to the coast which is highly absorbent in terms of water catchment. I should say that the Water Authority sensibly recognised that if we continue to use septic tank treatment for sewage, ultimately we will pollute the underground water supplies of Perth. That really is a problem and a concern to a lot of people. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I do not think we would necessarily have to go for the other option, that is, the ocean dumping of sewage. This tends to be a case of out of sight and out of mind. But, eventually we have to pay the price when we get to a critical level biologically speaking and the ocean can no longer tolerate effectively that amount of sewage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk briefly about the question of primary and secondary treatment. Primary treatment basically means that sewage is simply mixed up and pumped out. All that happens is that we simply spread the riches, if you like, and put them into the ocean, and people in Sydney will know what that means. Secondary treatment means in fact that we go through a biological process in which we try to remove many of the potential contaminants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Water Authority in Perth is very sensible. It has very sophisticated secondary treatment facilities. But we cannot necessarily remove all phosphates and nitrates with that treatment process. That is the difficulty. If in effect a relatively pure form of water, but with nitrates and phosphates still intact, is being dumped into the ocean, we really do have a problem in terms of management of that ocean marine park. My view is that the sensible thing is to land dump the water which still has nitrates and phosphates in it. If at the same time we plant quick growing gums such as Tasmanian blue gums we would then have an ongoing plantation arrangement that we could use for woodchipping. So not only would we solve the ocean outfall problem but also at the same time we would get a positive by-product. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem requires a little lateral thinking. But I think, like so many of our environmental problems, lateral thinking will be required if we are constructively to overcome it. I would suggest that in the context of this Parliament, looking to a new decade and then towards a new century, we need that sort of lateral thinking in order to overcome these sorts of problems. I earnestly recommend that the Metropolitan Water Authority seriously think about some lateral alternatives for dealing with Perth's sewage problem. We certainly do not want to encounter the problem that Sydney has at present. </PARA>

I am just amazed at the number of businessmen, operators of small business, coming to me now who are having to close their businesses-shop after shop, factory after factory; mum and dad businesses, small business, the very core and essence of productivity and activity in Australia. I predict that over the next six months and certainly by the end of the financial year there will be a record-breaking number of bankruptcies right across Australia. The members of the Australian Labor Party know this. It is the deplorable policies that this Government has instigated that have brought about high interest rates, punitive interest rates, and taxation way beyond anything that has ever been dreamed of by most Australians. Day after day they are called on to front new changes in taxation. More and more charges are being placed on them by both government and the banking system. It is a dreadful day out there in Australia for small business, and it is time that the Government changed its policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

Next Monday a delegation from the Port Kembla Harbour task force will be coming to Parliament to call on the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins. This harbour task force, which has now been in existence for a number of years, has revitalised and is continuing to revitalise the Port of Kembla. It was successful in getting the grain terminal there, and has worked with the farmers from the west at Eugowra. I suggest that those people who say that trade unionist and farmers cannot work together have a look at the work that has been carried on at Port Kembla.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Port Kembla has got tremendous potential. The only thing that is lacking is a proper road infrastructure-an all weather, all purpose road. The reason we have not got that is that the New South Wales Government and Minister Baird continue to refuse to nominate it as a priority under the provincial and rural roads program. If they did that, that road would be built within 18 months and Port Kembla could reach its full potential as an export development port. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. I remind him that the presumption of innocence is fundamental to our system of justice and with that in mind I ask him: How could any alleged lack of communication be deemed more important than the application of this presumption? Furthermore, in reference to the letters of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, both tabled and dated yesterday, concerning the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, is it not a fact that those letters were drafted virtually contemporaneously by officials? Were they not done in order to throw up a smokescreen on the question of communication in order to detract from the fundamental issue in question, the reversal of the presumption of innocence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and in particular his reminder of the fundamental principles of the law. In relation to the various parts of his question, the suggestion that correspondence between me and the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister and me in some way was concocted to throw up a smokescreen is an extraordinary suggestion and totally without foundation. The reason that I wrote to the Prime Minister was that I would have thought it was also fundamental, having regard to the obvious questions that were going to be asked and were asked yesterday, that the Prime Minister be fully informed of the position in relation to the allegations that would be made, and in fact were made, against Senator Tate. That is why a letter was written to the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first letter written was drafted in my office. That letter was altered in my office on at least four occasions and the final letter that went to the Prime Minister's office was a letter which resulted from a lot of work in pulling the whole thing together-which if you look at the letter, whatever criticisms you may have of it, does contain--</PARA>

I will conclude on the point I was making before about the continuing airing of this matter and the damage that may be done by the other side of the House. There is also division within the Opposition ranks over this matter. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth, does not support the efforts of the honourable member for Kooyong. On national 2UE radio network this morning the highly regarded Press Gallery commentator Julie Flynn said that she had contacted Dr Hewson's office this morning and Dr Hewson's office had said that it was inclined to let the matter rest. The Opposition, according to Dr Hewson, would have to be careful how it handled the matter. If it turned it into a political football, ensuring that the Sydney trial did not go ahead, then only further damage would be done. That is the exact position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of statements by the shadow Treasurer and shadow Minister for finance along the lines referred to by the honourable member for Fisher. I can assure the House that such statements are quite false. The March statement on Commonwealth financial transactions released by me last week indicates that the growth in outlays and revenues for this financial year is broadly in line with the Budget forecasts. Outlays are certainly not blowing out. Although there will probably be some slight variation from the Budget forecast in the actual outlays level, there will still be a fall in real outlays of the order of 0.7 per cent as forecast in the Budget. This will also be the fourth year in a row that real outlays will have declined. Furthermore, outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product will, as forecast in the Budget, be at the lowest level for 16 years and will have fallen by 6 percentage points of GDP in the last six years. Of course, we will have turned the $9 billion Budget deficit which existed when we came into office into a $9 billion surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In these circumstances it is a bit rich, I think, for the Opposition to accuse us of allowing-if I may quote the comment-`an alarming acceleration in the trend of fiscal irresponsibility evident under this Government'. There is patently no such trend. There is no deviation from the fiscal policy announced in the Budget. I can only assume that the shadow Treasurer, who is new in the job, and the shadow Minister for finance must have got confused with their own policies at the recent election when they had unfounded promises of $7 billion. Now there was some real fiscal irresponsibility.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question and acknowledge his ever-present interest in the questions of education, particularly in relation to schools. There is in New South Wales today an industrial dispute involving school teachers in the government school sector. It is an industrial dispute which is both unfortunate and unnecessary. It is unfortunate in that there are important issues that need to be addressed that are of concern to teachers and, I might say, parents and others in the community. Therefore, it is a pity that the New South Wales Government delayed for so long the commencement of negotiations on the serious issues which confront government schools in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some serious problems-some people have even said a crisis-facing the teaching profession in Australia. If we look at the investigations and the reports that have been written by, for instance, the Schools Council-our own primary source of advice on this matter-we find that there has been a very depressing development concerning those entering the teaching profession and those leaving it. In relation to those entering teacher education, over 12 per cent of those in one State at least have a tertiary entrance score of less than 700, which means that 60 per cent of year 12 students are in fact ahead of those entering the teaching profession, which obviously indicates that year 12 students contemplating a higher education rank teaching somewhat lower than they used to.</PARA>
<PARA> As well as that we find that an increasing number of teachers are leaving the profession after only five or maybe a few more years in the profession. That comes about because during that time-perhaps in their late 20s or early 20s-they reach a point on the salary scale beyond which they cannot move without leaving the classroom and going into an administrative position. This means that some of our best teachers, particularly those in the maths and sciences, are deserting our schools for other careers. What this means is that the teaching profession as a career has degenerated to the point where it is now seen as a career of last resort and one that a person leaves at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA> The claims of the teachers around Australia do not just constitute a pay grab, as some people would suggest. They are made in the context of award restructuring. And I might point out that accord mark 6 acknowledges the need for some flexibility in relation to teachers' salaries, and I might say nurses as well. But this is not being handled just as a matter of increasing salaries. The teachers and the Government are conscious of the need to take this opportunity to ensure that we have an improvement in the quality of teaching throughout not just the government school sector but the non-government school sector as well.</PARA>
<PARA> I might say that I have been enormously gratified that the teachers have agreed to place on the negotiating agenda a range of issues which are crucial to improving the quality of teaching in the future. For instance, they are as keen as we are to address such issues as teacher mobility, improvement of career structures, reform of workplace organisation, structural efficiency issues generally, teacher training and teacher recruitment, merit-based promotion, and the extent to which professional development should occur outside the normal teaching year.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these matters are primarily a State responsibility but I think the time has come when we need to deal with this on a national basis. It was for that reason that we said before the election that we wanted to convene a national negotiation to deal with these issues in a national context. I have already had one meeting with State Ministers and all but one of the States have agreed on the importance of dealing with this question in a national context and I hope that New South Wales, the only other State, will come on board in the near future. This is an important opportunity for us to take, not only to ensure that Australia can look forward to a quality teaching profession in the future, but also to ensure that our young people leaving our schools in the future have the skills relevant and necessary for the developments within our economy.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="271" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the address I gave yesterday to the National Press Club I made it clear that the ratio of indirect tax to revenue in Australia was 29.8 per cent compared with an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 30.3. That leads any reasonable person to conclude that the weight of taxation on indirect taxation in Australia is at or around the OECD level, and it is certainly worth noting that six of the seven largest OECD countries have lower indirect tax to total tax than does Australia. So the argument which is being put about that Australia has a relatively small base of indirect taxation vis-a-vis comparable countries is basically unfounded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also worth making the point, as the questioner asked about the Government's intention, that the Government's intention has been to make certain that the indirect base, the proportion of indirect tax to revenue, has not declined over the years, particularly as we have seen a decline in the revenue out of Bass Strait.</PARA>
<PARA> The former Government lived in the salad days of Bass Strait with all that easy, lazy money coming out of those big pools, like Halibut and Kingfish. Those areas are now finished or are in a secondary recovery. We have kept the indirect tax base in reasonable fettle.</PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that we should be moving to a consumption tax. As I indicated yesterday, a consumption tax now cannot produce enough surplus dollars to cut marginal tax rates. Where in the past this was possible for a number of reasons, particularly in 1985, it is not possible now. It might be worth adumbrating those reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the base for a consumption tax had within it what we call restricted goods, such things as building materials, food and other goods, particularly those which are now referred to as business inputs. The rationale now for a consumption tax is not to tax those things. Naturally, when examining the base for such a tax those items have to be removed. Therefore, the base is smaller.</PARA>
<PARA> The wholesale sales tax base is larger. It has been expanded in these years, in part because of the rundown of Bass Strait and other influences in the excises. That means that when one looks at the yield of a consumption tax, discounting the wholesale sales tax, there is now a smaller gap than there used to be.</PARA>
<PARA> The third reason is that the fiscal yield or dividend is smaller. In 1985 we had to look at the compensation not just of social security beneficiaries but also of taxpayers by shifting tax thresholds, compensating the then existing tax base. The then existing tax base was very narrow with high marginal rates. It is now a much broader base by virtue of capital gains, fringe benefits, substantiation, the prescribed payments system, audits, et cetera. Now, the costs of compensating the tax base or taxpayers is much greater because more income has been brought to tax and therefore more income has to be compensated.</PARA>
<PARA> All of these things mean that there is now not the surplus of funds available to cut income tax rates. Therefore, the savings argument on which most of the renewed interest in the consumption tax has been built falls apart. The savers are basically people on higher incomes. If the system does not yield new, fresh money to cut the tax rates at the top end of the tax system the savings point breaks down.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I think a lot of the proponents of the consumption tax have forgotten is that one has to compensate taxpayers for more than that which they spend on consumption. One also has to compensate them for that for which they save-that is, future consumption. We are simply not giving back that which the consumption tax yields. We have to give back more because one has to return the tax on the savings as well.</PARA>
<PARA> These are all the reasons that Opposition members are now trying weakly to move away from their hairy chested commitment-ill thought through, ill conceived-to a consumption tax of a week or two ago. Opposition members should have sat down and said, `We have taken a defeat and the public did not buy our shonky wages policy. We also had'-as the then Minister for Finance said-`a $7 billion set of unfunded commitments. We went to the election without a health policy; with a monetary policy to cut inflation which would have ground the economy into the dust. We were also going to abolish the capital gains tax'. If they had been elected to office that tax would now have an eight-year backdating. Instead of focusing on those things on day one, under the new leader, the party without ideas was embracing the consumption tax. Those opposite should not suggest that they are the people with the ideas, the ones who will put the big one on the agenda. Now the Opposition has to face some of the harsh realities of arithmetic. Last night on the Late Line program we heard the Leader of the Opposition say:</PARA>
<PARA> I've only suggested it should be put on the agenda for review.</PARA>
<PARA>`Only', small word, big meaning. He later said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is worth reviewing that measure, not in any sense that it's a panacea in its own right, because it isn't.</PARA>
<PARA>Another quote was:</PARA>
<PARA> The only point I can see is that over the last 10 or 12 years that this tax has been on the agenda for public debate, the scope for significant tax cuts has been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>Already he was moving back from the tax cut capacity. The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the savings argument in favour of a consumption tax is no longer a strong argument.</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from the Leader of the Opposition was:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, it's an argument, but it's not, you know, it does have and can have some significant effect on savings. But it's not as strong an argument as it was several years ago . . . I agree that the argument is less strong . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it's not the panacea for savings that people argue that it is . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So we are starting to detect at least some reasonable movement away. The former Leader of the Opposition embraced the inflation adjustment proposal and then dropped it and was let off by the media on the basis that he was economically illiterate. But the Leader of the Opposition should not think that he can wriggle off this hook and be given the same generous treatment.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first part of the question is that the proposals in relation to the cooperative research centres do not cut across any of the existing Government measures, in particular the one that was referred to, the 150 per cent tax deduction. I add that last night I introduced into the House a piece of legislation which will modify that 150 per cent because some companies were double dipping. So that is an appropriate measure. The 150 per cent has been an important initiative on the part of this Government in getting industry back into research and development in this country, which it walked away from under the previous regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the question also raises an interesting point because the issue of the protection of intellectual property is an important issue for this Government to address. I know that the Minister for Trade Negotiations is addressing this in the context of the international environment in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round of negotiations and how we might come to a global approach on the recognition of intellectual property. So far as this Government is concerned initiatives have been commenced between the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and the Attorney-General's Department because the question of patents falls under the purview of the former; indeed, I have direct responsibility for that. The question of copyright falls under the latter. In a number of these areas where important research and development is occurring and important industry initiatives are being developed, there is something of a fudging between the two. It is something that the Government has to address, is aware of and will be taking to task in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. She raises a very important issue about the need for Australia to improve the skills of our work force. The climate has been created in the context of award restructuring whereby that can happen because increasingly in this country we will see people paid an amount that relates to what they can do rather than what they are called. Therefore, I was very concerned, as I am sure were the honourable member and others, about the results of a survey produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, commissioned by this Government, to see what was the level of expenditure on training within the private and public sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What that revealed was that the training performance in Australia is even worse than we had suspected-even worse than had been revealed as far as the private sector was concerned by some work done by the Confederation of Australian Industry. According to this survey, on average employers in Australia spend about 2.2 per cent of gross wages and salaries on formal training. In the private sector it is 1.7 per cent and in the public sector it is somewhat larger, nearly double, at 3.2 per cent. What is particularly important and I think alarming is that 57 per cent of all private sector enterprises with a payroll of over $200,000 spend nothing whatsoever on formal training, and a further 10 to 20 per cent spend between zero and one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicates that there has not been any change in the training effort on the part of industry over the last 12 to 18 months. I think that we are entitled to feel alarmed that Australian industry has not realised the importance, indeed the urgency, of trying to improve the skills of the Australian work force if we are going to be able to respond as a modern nation at the end of this century to the extraordinary challenges and the greater competition that confront us in the international marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA> Normally one would expect that when industry, particularly private industry, was confronted by that greater need for competition it would realise that issues such as the skills of its work force, investment in quality and design and in research and development, as my colleague the Minister for Science and Technology indicated in the previous answer, would all be high priority, top priority issues for those making decisions in the boardrooms of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably the Government has discovered that we have had to come in and provide either incentives or other kinds of measures to try to ensure that there is an appropriate response from Australian industry. The research and development incentive is one, and there is another measure which I will have the pleasure of introducing into this House later today. I do not want to anticipate the debate on that matter. That will ensure that Australian industry in the future spends at least one per cent, and in the second year 1 3/4 per cent, of its payroll on training.</PARA>
<PARA> If we do not have that kind of commitment to an increased effort on the part of industry to instil those skills, not only into recruits into industry but perhaps even more importantly into those who are already in industry and need their skills upgraded to be relevant to modern circumstances, then I do not think we will be able to respond adequately to the challenges that confront this nation in the future.</PARA>

That is the record that we have got. We do not have to apologise for the facts. The facts are, and again I will repeat them, that as a result of the successive decisions that we have made we have done better than indexation, something that those opposite were not able to achieve when they were in office.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware, as I am sure most people in New South Wales are aware, of the claims and position being taken today by the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Collins, regarding his reported direction to hospitals to increase their charges to pensioners and young disabled, and going on to blame the Commonwealth for not providing sufficient funds for the home and community care program. The facts of the matter are that the Commonwealth increased its funding for the home and community care program in New South Wales this year by 20 per cent compared with 16 per cent by the Government of New South Wales. Since 1985-86 the Commonwealth has increased its expenditure on the home and community care program by 237 per cent in New South Wales compared with 132 per cent by the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real problem here and the real matter of this dispute is the fact that it is a dispute between two New South Wales departments and the inability of the Premier of that State and his Ministers basically to resolve it internally.</PARA>
<PARA> This is senior citizens week in New South Wales. During the last couple of weeks the old people and the frail aged-as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs reminds me, also some of the people who have just come back from Gallipoli-would have realised that this is senior citizens week and that it was good to have that attention paid to them. They would be hearing about the focus on the ageing project. Now we know what Mr Collins means by the focus on the ageing. The aged are going to be paying more to pick up the tab in the health system in New South Wales for meals on wheels, as yesterday Mr Collins, the Minister for Health in New South Wales, threatened to put up charges for the meals on wheels service provided to the frail aged and young disabled. He was properly abused by all sections of the media in New South Wales. Today he switches his attack to the Federal Government-the old bunny-as he always does. It will not work.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Federal Government has made very significant increases in those commitments under the home and community care program. We are paying about 60 per cent of the funding of the home and community care program in New South Wales this year. Billions of dollars have been invested in the infrastructure of the hospital system. We have the opportunity to efficiently and at marginal cost produce a few extra meals for those people most deserving at home in the community who would otherwise, in many cases, be in those very hospitals. But that is not good enough for Mr Collins.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to Mr Collins and to the Government of New South Wales that this Government will always be willing to talk about better services and the more efficient delivery of those services in programs such as this. But this Government is not prepared to either pay or be abused for its contribution to cover up the New South Wales Government's internal fights over its own internal funding. The Commonwealth is certainly not prepared to stand by and let the New South Wales Government or any of its Ministers treat the frail aged and young disabled in this way.</PARA>

Does the Treasurer agree that even on the basis of optimistic assumptions an achievement of this objective would require gross national expenditure to increase at less than one-third of the rate of growth experienced under the seven years of the Hawke Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government never made a commitment about it. It said that it was an objective and one which we believe is capable of being achieved-that is, that we can draw enough net exports from the system over the next couple of years to see the current account deficit reach a stabilisation point on the debt, which is somewhere between 2 3/4 and 3 per cent. That is why we have the current policy mix in place. As honourable members would have noticed in the December quarter accounts which were released during the election campaign, we have succeeded in taking gross national expenditure (GNE) from a growth of 9.1 per cent for the year to September down to about 4.6 per cent for the year to December. That was very much in balance with GDP which was running at about 4.5 per cent. Therefore, that balance looks a lot more conducive to an improvement in the current account than when we had GNE or demand running at twice product growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and I have said many times that policy will mean in the next few years that GDP must stay ahead of GNE. That means one of two things. It means we must run a sensible demand management regime, but not the one that the Opposition would run which would comatose the place, and we must lift GDP by lifting production. The best way of lifting production is to maintain investment, but investment cannot be maintained with punishing levels of interest rates and a monetary policy which would eradicate inflation over three or five years, which was the Opposition's policy. Those kinds of attendant interest rates would not allow investment to continue, and if investment continues GDP will not continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA> We have capital stock moving up about 6 per cent a year. Hopefully we will reach the point of those dreadful years between 1968 and 1973 when the capital stock was left to decline to such miserable levels that we gave ourselves a huge current account and external problem. We will get the capital stock back to critical mass and even with rates of investment slower than the last couple of years, we can add to that capital stock to trade our way out of trouble.</PARA>
<PARA> Finding that balance between maintaining profitability and investment and, at the same time, maintaining a strong fiscal, monetary and wage position to keep demand in check is what policy setting is about. At least, that is the balance we want.</PARA>

The Opposition, if it had won the election, would have said, `Leave them on. Don't give them a break. Let's grind the place into the ground. That will cut the wages growth. It will put unemployment up, and we can deal with it then'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition never followed through with the second part of the scenario: How does one improve the productive base of the place if the investment stops?

But how does the Opposition expect investment to come back out of the ashes and how would it get production back?</PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, the Opposition does not have a clue, and that is basically why the business community gave it the thumbs down in the campaign and why the public re-elected the Government. The Government has a strategy to overcome the shameful years of neglect by coalition governments from 1968-1983-bar three years of Labor-when the capital stock fell to pieces and the Opposition was putting everything on a resources boom which did not eventuate. We were left with a huge external deficit which was already 6 per cent of GDP in 1980-10 years ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for that question. He is a member very well known to me because we have both, very successfully, spent a fair amount of time out in the electorate of Grey. The question concerns the report from the Rail Industry Council which was handed down yesterday by the Chairman, Mr Gavin Keneally. The Rail Industry Council was established in about 1987. The particular charge that it had was to examine the opportunities that we would have for medium to longer term improvements, and particularly investment improvements, in the national rail system. There was a growing recognition generally that in Australia there had been considerable attention given to the whole question of improving the national road system by successive governments over a considerable period of time. In the process of doing that, for generations there had been a lack of opportunity taken to improve the rail network as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

What we were concerned about doing was simply to assemble the information which we could gather and it is important because we have to understand that over the next 10 years the total national freight task will increase by about 60 per cent.

They have got to be made to perform and we have indicated not only that particular initiative but also the national freight initiative which is already being undertaken at the present time and on which there will be a progress report presented this Friday by Mr Ted Butcher.</PARA>

All of them said that the specific promise made by the Government had been delivered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just on the off-chance-and I presume that it is an off-chance-that the honourable member has some real interest in this subject and is not concerned with trying to tear at a bone which has been well and truly buried by these organisations themselves, let me tell him what has been done, so that he will know. Two years ago, in deliverance of the promise that we made in 1987, we introduced the family allowance supplement. That family allowance supplement provided tax-free allowances to low income families. As a result, more than half a million families, including some 1.2 million children, are being helped with family allowance supplement payments or their equivalent in extra pension and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> I inform the honourable member, in case he does not know, that included in family allowances is over $2 billion of Commonwealth funding for children in low income families. As I say, it is that process which has enabled the Government to deliver on the promise made specifically in 1987, which delivery of promise has been acknowledged by all those organisations to which I have referred and which has adjured the Opposition to try to make political capital out of something which cannot carry that task. Not only have we provided these payments to 1.2 million children but also we have ensured, by providing indexation to these payments, that the real value of these tax-free payments will be maintained in future.</PARA>
<PARA> But that is not all we have done. For homeless youth we have put in place a $100m package of initiatives, providing accommodation for the homeless, income support, labour market assistance, education, health care and improved access to services. In addition, coming right up to date, on 8 March this year I announced the Government's commitment to a series of measures to address deficiencies in the provision of services for disadvantaged families and children because we know that despite the fact, as these organisations have said, that we have specifically delivered on the financial promise that we made, there are still difficulties. It was to address those difficulties that on 8 March this year I announced the Government's commitment to a series of measures to address deficiencies in the provision of services for disadvantaged children and their families.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, nearly 280,000 families will benefit from new child-care arrangements. There will be another 50,000 places over the next five years and a higher fee relief ceiling. In all, by mid-1996 the Government will spend $400m in the biggest expansion of child-care in Australia's history. Other measures include the establishment of family resource centres and increased funding for marriage counselling, family mediation, outside school hours care for at-risk adolescents, a package of education programs and an additional $85m over three years for public transport.</PARA>
<PARA> I and my colleagues in Government readily acknowledge that the causes of disadvantage are complex, requiring wide ranging and ongoing responses. We have, therefore, established a Commonwealth-State-Territory ministerial committee to look at ways of improving the effectiveness of the services provided for disadvantaged children. During this Govern-ment's fourth term the approach that I have outlined will continue to be developed as part of our overall strategy in this area. One would have thought that by this stage those opposite-old and new-would have learnt the lesson which Bishop Hollingworth tried to hammer into their heads, and that is--</PARA>

I think his visit to Australia at this time is a recognition of the crucial role that Australia has played in those negotiations and a great debt is owed to my predecessors, the present Attorney-General, and the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training, for the role that they played in establishing this quite crucial role for Australia in these negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Dunkel spoke at international conferences on services, which is a major issue in the round, and met with members of the trade negotiations advisory group. He also had round table discussions with me, with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and with senior Government officials. He gave his quite frank views on the state of the round and Australia's role in negotiations. Mr Dunkel stressed the importance of making maximum use of the remaining time in the round. He made it quite clear that agreements must be reached by the accepted day in July to have a framework for the final package of results in all 15 areas under negotiation and these are to be the basis for the ultimate agreement. He warned us that if that July deadline is not met the time to complete the negotiations on detail may well run out.</PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General fully acknowledged the crucial role of agriculture in any successful outcome from the round. He commended the Cairns Group for bringing together countries from diverse backgrounds in the cause of agricultural reform. He noted that this group would have a critical role in putting a set of options differing from those of the United States and the European Community. In this regard, of course, the meeting of the Cairns Group in Chile in early July will be vital in ensuring that interests of member countries continue to be reflected in these vital negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> For our part we reiterated to the Director-General of GATT our commitment to a successful conclusion of the round and our determination that a substantial result on agricultural is a necessary feature of the package. Of course, nothing, no single set of decisions, will do more to determine the opportunities for trade in the coming decade than a successful outcome of this round in December.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bennelong)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.02)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There exists in Australia at present a remarkable degree of agreement extending across political lines, within academic circles, amongst economic commentators and certainly amongst professional economists that if this country is to have any hope of overcoming its enormous current account deficit problems in the years ahead, if we are to learn to stop borrowing on the savings of foreigners to finance our excessive domestic consumption then one thing certainly must be done and must be done quickly and that is the pace of micro-economic reform must be accelerated and prosecuted and carried to a successful conclusion in a wide number of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be no exaggeration to say that over the past couple of months, and certainly since the last election, there has been a veritable outbreak of enthusiasm so far as the present commentators are concerned for the cause of micro-economic reform. It has become the flavour of the month and it is likely to be the flavour of the next three years. That is what makes this matter of public importance so relevant because if we are really serious as a nation in achieving micro-economic reform the area above all areas where progress must be made is that of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if the Government were to achieve a 100 per cent strike rate-which it will not-in areas like the waterfront, in coastal shipping, in communications and in transport, all of that would be of only relative significance if it does not achieve any real progress in reforming Australia's industrial relations system. It is the pivot of Australia's micro-economic reform prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government fails the test on that front and on that issue it cannot possibly lay any claim to glittering micro-economic reform credentials over the next three years. It stands without argument that the biggest single economic challenge this country has is to turn around that current account deficit. We do not have the proverbial earthly of doing that unless we can do something about our appalling productivity performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind those opposite again of what Senator Walsh, the former Minister for Finance, had to say when he castigated the accord's failure to deliver productivity gains. I remind those opposite of the recent Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report which categorised the productivity failure of this country over the past few years. I put it to this House that it is the inability of the industrial relations system of the present Government to deliver on the productivity front that will become the fatal flaw of the fourth Hawke Government. It is a total illusion for those opposite to imagine that the present industrial relations system that this country has can possibly deliver productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA> I start my comments on this issue by reminding those opposite that industrial relations goes further than the institutions that are the major players in industrial relations in Australia. Many people have said that industrial relations ought to be renamed human relations. It is typical of the approach of this Government to industrial relations that the first statements made by the new Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook-a person for whom I have some regard and a person who has a deep experience in the union movement-were about union amalgamation and union mergers. In other words, the circumference of his understanding is about the organisations. He forgets, of course, that only 41 per cent of the Australian work force is represented by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He forgets that only 32 per cent of the private sector work force of this country is employed by unions affiliated with the ACTU. He forgets that there is more to industrial relations than agreements between the power constellations in the industrial arena. </PARA>
<PARA> Our starting point is that the best industrial relations outcome is where individual employees and their employers sit down together and work out the way in which they, working together, can best lift the productivity of their enterprise to their mutual benefit and to the national economic benefit. That ought to be the goal and the objective of any industrial relations system. Over the next three years we will be putting to the Australian people our views, quite radical views in some areas-we say that unapologetically-for the reform of Australia's industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that productivity can be lifted at a national level unless it is lifted at an individual-enterprise level. It cannot be lifted at an individual-enterprise level in a sufficiently satisfactory and comprehensive way unless individual firms and their employees are liberated from the straitjacket of the accord and the chloroforming effects of the centralised wage fixation system. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that there are some in the industrial arena who continue to seek the cosy comfort of the centralised system. We recognise that some of the changes that have been made by the Government in relation to certified agreements take it a step towards a better outcome. But unless we are prepared as a community to embrace the notion in industrial relations of voluntary agreements, unless we are prepared to say to individual firms and their workers, `You go away and work out the best arrangement for your circumstances' to the exclusion of the Industrial Relations Commission, the ACTU, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia or the Metal Trades Industry Association, we will not achieve the sorts of productivity gains that are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes around the world and examines those countries which have been more successful in lifting productivity, one will find that in more cases than not-not in all cases, but in more cases than not-it is the enormous flexibility and the deregulated nature of their industrial relations system which has made a major contribution. Of course, those opposite will do in response to this what they have done over the last seven years. They will trot out all the canards and deceptions about what happened in 1982 and what happened in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> We may as well start by dealing with some of those and by saying to those opposite that the world now in 1990 is very different from what it was in 1981 and certainly different from what it was in 1974. To start with, the legal situation in the industrial relations arena is now less lopsided than it was in 1981 or 1974. In 1974 there was no section 45d of the Trade Practices Act. In 1981 we had not heard of those historic disputes at Mudginberri and Dollar Sweets Co. Pty Ltd, which demonstrated for all time the nonsense of the proposition that a trade union that destroyed somebody's business could not be taken to court and held to account for what it had done. Until a few short years ago it was a sacrosanct principle of industrial relations in this country that the last thing one could ever do was to take a union to court and to hold it accountable for destroying one's business. But that notion was put in ruins by the Mudginberri dispute and the Dollar Sweets case. So the first answer to the great lie of 1981 is that the legal situation has changed, and changed for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing is that everybody was seared by the unemployment consequences of the recessions of 1981 and 1982 and of 1974. That has left a permanent impression on trade union leaders and business leaders alike. I have said already outside of this place, and I will say it again, that over the past few years the quality of union leadership in this country has improved. I say to the new Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) that, under his leadership and that of the present Secretary of the ACTU, the ACTU was prepared on occasions to put the national interest ahead of sectional interests in a way that was not apparent under the leadership of the ACTU in the 1970s. The experience of that last wages break-out has had a permanent impact on both players in the industrial arena. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the other great change is that the trade union movement's greatest challenge in the 1990s will not be to destroy the industrial relations policy of a future coalition government. The great challenge that the union movement will face in the 1990s will be to retain its members. Like all organisations in the modern world, it is finding it difficult to attract members. Generally speaking, women do not like joining trade unions; the young like joining trade unions even less. The archetypal trade unionist in Australia has now become a middle-aged male. I say to some of the fire-eaters who may be left in sections of the trade union movement and who still see industrial relations in this country in old class conflict terms that their great challenge in the 1990s will be to hold on to their members. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very happy to say at the commencement of this parliamentary session that, of all of the areas of micro-economic reform and challenge, industrial relations is the one in which success or failure is most crucial to Australia's economic future. We have a policy developed by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) which, when it was first developed, was criticised by many as being unrealistic and too radical. But, over a period, many sections of the business community, and indeed even sections of the trade union movement-some at the cost of their employment security, as the poor unfortunate Mr Duffy employed by the Labour Council of New South Wales found out a few months ago-have been attracted to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The wave of the future in industrial relations is not towards a more centralised, rigid, controlled system. It is towards a recognition that enterprise bargaining, reaching solutions at a firm or enterprise level, is the best way to lift individual productivity. As industry after industry recognises this, particularly in the small business sector and the burgeoning service sector industries, the pressure on the accord and the manifest failure of the accord will become even more apparent. We do not limit our horizons of enterprise bargaining to the private sector, because one of the great anomalies thrown up by the accord is its punitive effect on many public sector employees in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that teachers in Australia are grossly underpaid; it is a fact that many people in the nursing profession are grossly underpaid; and it is a fact that many people in law enforcement-the police-are grossly underpaid. It is also a fact that the capacity of the Commonwealth Public Service to retain high quality people in its upper echelons is almost exhausted because of the centralised wage fixation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of trying to cobble together a deal with Martin Ferguson or trying to prop up a failing system, what this Government should be doing in relation to the Public Service is to say to individual permanent heads, `We will give you a cash limit. You have this amount of money and you go away and work out how many employees you want in your Department and what their levels of remuneration will be'. If the Government really believes in letting managers manage-which is the great cliche of public service management these days-then it will have the courage to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House that there is no micro-economic challenge more important than that of industrial relations reform. I predict that in three years time there will be no area where this Government has more demonstrably failed than in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the address by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), interesting for what it did not say. It basically said nothing about what is happening under the centralised system at present, especially the fact that the centralised system is becoming much less centralised. I would have thought that, in a speech which was based on the proposition that what we need is a decentralised system in which we have industrial relations outcomes being increasingly determined by negotiation at the enterprise level, there might just have been a mere moment of mention about what is actually happening at present under the centralised system, as it is being called, although it is becoming much less centralised, and the direction in which it is headed. There has been no mention of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's position basically is that we need more flexibility in the system, more enterprise agreements and, therefore, we should scrap everything that currently exists, wipe all that out and allow voluntary agreements to take place at the enterprise level. I think that is an extraordinary proposition which I do not think in the last election had much credibility amongst commentators around the country, and it did not have much credibility amongst people on either side of the industrial fence. There might have been the odd person on the employer side, but many employers certainly do not think that it has a lot going for it, and the union movement certainly does not. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought it was fairly clear for those involved in industrial relations, both in terms of a direct involvement and those who are interested observers, that overwhelmingly the view is that certainly we need more flexibility, but we do not throw the whole system out and hope that some new system, whereby we would allow people absolutely to do as they like at the enterprise level without any control by any authority at all or any guidelines, would produce a better outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> There are obviously enormous dangers in going down that path. Those dangers relate to the overall wages outcomes that we would get. When the then Leader of the Opposition was asked in the early stages of the election campaign what the wages outcome in his policy would be he said, `Who knows? Who knows?'. That is the position that the Opposition has. It was an entirely frank and honest statement. It has no idea what the wages outcome would be. There would be no wages policy as such. It would simply be whatever turned up from the operation of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> As we all know, the one level of control that we have in those circumstances is to crunch the economy which was something the Opposition did whilst in office on a number of occasions. It was its only method of trying to control the wages outcome. Obviously the Opposition's system in relation to wages leaves an awful lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of a better industrial relations environment and improved productivity, which the honourable member for Bennelong emphasised was important-I agree that it is important-he assumes from some system in which people sit down and talk to each other that there would be increased productivity. It does not naturally follow that that would be the case. It may well be in some areas. It may well not be in other areas where the parties simply agree to arrangements which would be very comfortable at the expense of the customers. We have had many examples of that in our past industrial relations history. There is no reason to believe that under that sort of system it would not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need in an industrial relations system is some sort of guideline, some kind of system, which puts pressure on the parties to produce appropriate outcomes to the national need. We do not get that simply by saying, `All go off and do your own thing and we will hope that it turns out for the best', assuming that it were even possible to be done legally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has never come up with the answer to the question that has been put to it by the Government on a number of occasions as to how it would bring about a system of voluntary agreements and under what constitutional power would the Commonwealth be able to produce that. Presumably the only power that is around is the corporations power. If there is any other power that it has in mind to use we would like to hear about it. What would the Opposition do about the 77 per cent of small businesses which are not corporations? Presumably, it has not addressed that issue at all. The previous spokesman on industrial relations refused to answer the question when it was put to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is pursuing an impractical course, one which would lead to wages outcomes if it could be put in place but these would be unknown and possibly very damaging outcomes. They would be very damaging to individuals in other areas where employers have a lot of bargaining power, vis-a-vis the employees, and could squeeze them into great reductions in their conditions of employment below what we would regard as reasonable standards in this country. On the other hand, it may be a wages outcome which could be very damaging nationally. There are no guarantees at all about productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly thought to be infinitely more sensible to pursue a course which is being pursued at present, and has been for some years, within a system based on conciliation and arbitration to try to achieve a much greater degree of flexibility by a gradual process of change. That change has been agreed to by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) as mentioned by the Opposition spokesman in his speech. He did not mention the fact that the OECD report certainly approved of the second tier changes and the structural efficiency principle and the outcomes that are being achieved from that but said that there are further things needed. I agree that further things are needed. The Government also agrees. But it is a matter of how much one can do at one time. Certainly, the pace of change is being picked up all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the second tier I believe that there were some very important developments. The most important development-I agree with the OECD on this-was not only that many firms got appropriate outcomes in terms of increases in efficiency but also that there was a development of consultative arrangements at the enterprise level which did not exist before. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an enduring legacy of the second tier in many enterprises and provides the basis for further development of arrangements at the enterprise level which are being put in place under the structural efficiency principle. Therein lies the movement towards much greater flexibility at the enterprise level than we have ever known before in this country-a matter entirely unremarked by the Opposition spokesman-and a tremendously important development in terms of improving flexibility and the capacity of employees and employers to determine arrangements in their workplace in a way which suits the people in that workplace. That is something on which the Opposition spokesman has placed some importance in the past. Those arrangements are being put in place now under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is early days and there is no time at this stage to see how it is working out, but certainly it is relevant to note that under the structural efficiency principle second stage agreements are being reached. I refer to the agreement such as the one in the metal industry because it indicates what is being done at the enterprise level. The enterprise agreement which is in the ratified agreement between the metal industry unions and employers states:</PARA>
<PARA>Without limiting the rights of either an employer or a union to arbitration, any other measure designed to increase flexibility at the plant or enterprise and sought by any party shall be notified to the Commission and by agreement of the parties involved shall be implemented subject to the following requirements:</PARA>
<PARA>I will not read out all of those requirements but they include the following:</PARA>
<PARA>the majority of employees affected by the change at the plant or enterprise must genuinely agree to the change:</PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>any agreement shall be subject to approval by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and if approved, shall operate as a Schedule to this award and take precedence over any provision of this award to the extent of any inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA>This award really led the award restructuring approach-apart from the shipping industry, of which I hope I will have time to make mention. It is the biggest award and has the greatest focus in terms of the structural efficiency principle. There is quite clearly scope for enterprise agreements of a nature which will allow flexibility in working arrangements. Of course, that is highly desirable and something which the parties have agreed should occur. </PARA>
<PARA> That clause is also in similar types of other agreements, for example the Miscellaneous Workers Union award, various clerical awards, timber industry awards, textile, clothing and footwear industry and so on. I expect it will be in many more before the structural efficiency principle agreements are finally approved by the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing under the present system the scope for an enormous liberalisation where award conditions can be supplanted by agreement between employer and employees at the workplace. Of course, the unions will obviously have an interest in that. In some cases they may be very much involved and in other cases not so much involved but the awards generally include the clause that the union will not unreasonably oppose any agreement, which seems to me to be helpful in terms of putting an emphasis on the fact that it should be the views of the people at the enterprise level which have tremendous importance in deciding what should happen in respect of their own working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those are tremendous changes and they are indicative of what is being achieved. Of course, flexibility is being enormously enhanced through award restructuring-through the broad banding, the reclassification, the multiskilling. This brings me to the need for training. Herein lies a tremendous challenge to the employers in this country because the vast majority of employers do not undertake any training and do not spend any money on training. That is something which simply has to change, and later this day the Government will be introducing legislation to bring about that change and require employers to undertake training. If we want a more skilled work force-and I am sure we all do-then we certainly should require employers to play their part, and their part includes spending money on training. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an obligation on employers, as the OECD noted, to take a much greater interest in trying to improve arrangements in the workplace and to be interested in improving productivity. It has noted rightly that much of what is occurring at present has come about not because of the employers of this country but because the unions and the Government were driving the agenda, and driving the changes which are occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The employers of this country simply have to get off their behinds and really make an effort. They are being increasingly put into situations where there is greater competition being forced upon them. If they do not make that greater effort then increasingly they are going to go to the wall because the comforting protection that they had in various forms in the past is being increasingly stripped away. What they face is the need to become much more sensitive to the efficiency of their own enterprises and to drive the agenda rather more than they have in the past and to have some real involvement and some real commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The appalling effort on training is indicative of how poorly Australian employers have served the nation in terms of playing their full role in trying to increase productivity and therefore the national standard of living. I believe that this country is now going through a period of change which is unprecedented. Indeed, since this Government has been in office there has been far more happen in terms of micro-economic reform and structural change than has happened in the rest of this century. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the need for that change was the appalling performance of conservative governments in the post-war period which simply allowed industry in this country to meander along under high protection with all sorts of structural inefficiencies and did not in any way drive those companies to much more efficient arrangements. When the conservatives got into Opposition they started to berate the Government for not moving fast enough to undo all of the things that they let sit there for 30 years in the post-war period. Before we got into government, for 30 out of 33 previous years, we had government by conservatives and they had allowed all this structural inefficiency to be built into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had tremendous change in that area, including in the industrial relations area, and it is continuing. The structural efficiency principle changes will be brought in over the next three years. How effective they are will depend on the people in the workplaces, including the employers. The structural change in the awards gives them enormous scope to improve their efficiency. If they are up to it, then they can get enormous increases in productivity over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the structure which has been put in place now gives Australia the greatest scope for change that we could hope for and certainly far better than we would get by scrapping that system and trying, if it was legally possible, to bring in a system of simply voluntary agreements and hope, with no structure at all, that the parties might settle down to improving their position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must respond briefly at the outset to the allegations of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) that we propose to throw out all existing industrial relations arrangements altogether. We have consistently stated that the present system may be left in place for those who, I think in the words of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), feel the need for the comfort of the existing centralised system, albeit one which needs to be charged with different responsibilities to make it more responsive to prevailing economic circumstances. It is plainly the case that the present centralised system, for whatever reforms may have taken place, is still hopelessly unable to meet the needs of a beleaguered economy, and beleaguered our economy certainly is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it seems to me that we as Australians now face two essential options left open to us in view of the quite conclusive evidence that we are living beyond our means. We can go on pulling in our belts until our champagne lifestyle matches our beer income, or we can lift our beer income to match our taste for the good life. One thing is certain, however, and that is that we cannot continue to have our cake and to eat it too. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long in this country we have indulgently and slothfully argued about how to slice up the cake and forgotten about the size of the cake. Nowhere perhaps is this tendency more pronounced than in the labour market arena, the industrial relations arena, where we seem to be able to go on ignoring the desperate need for change, despite our ever increasing current account deficits, our weakening currency and our declining manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I want this afternoon in the short time that is available to me to touch very briefly on three aspects of Australia's labour market situation. Firstly, I want to look at the linkage between inflation and wages policy. Secondly, I would like to look at the impact of our centralised wage fixing system on the small business and farm sector. Thirdly, I would like to look very briefly at the attitudes of the union movement towards all of this. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be said that we have got an ugly big old bull called inflation wandering around the china shop of the Australian economy. He feeds well enough on the labour hay of monetary policy and loose fiscal policy vagaries, but he does especially nicely, thank you, on Labor's wages policy `hay'. It is packed with goodies like excessive rigidities, lack of marketplace awareness, inflexibility and it is seasoned well with presumption and interference on the part of the industrial relations club. The bull just gorges away on it all and becomes bigger and uglier. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australians really knew just what damage inflation is doing to our economy they would surely want it tamed and tamed fast. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) knows how important this issue is. He has told us how important it is. He has nominated inflation as our No. 1 economic disease. Despite that he does not seem concerned to do too much about it. We are promised inflation rates of 3 or 4 per cent every year and we get 7 or 8 per cent. Amazingly, he seems to get away with it. We enjoy-if that is the word-inflation rates of around double Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development averages. Inflation rates strip away our savings, distort our investment patterns, and decimate our international trading competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that the Treasurer seems to be able to get away with this? It seems to me that it is very largely because we have a wages policy, itself a major contributor to our inflation rate, which insulates the great bulk of the Australian people from what is really happening. They tell me that a frog in water which is slowly heated stays there until he boils because he does not realise what is really happening. You throw him into hot water and he will jump out straight away. It seems that our clumsy, unresponsive and inflexible wage fixing mechanisms are slowly boiling us and we are failing to realise what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> The signals that all is not well are not getting through clearly and loudly enough to the Australian people. We pretend that we can go on living with inflation by continually adjusting wages to compensate for increases in the cost of living. We simply have not made anything like enough progress in reforming this absurdity-and absurdity it surely is: it is a dog chasing its tail. Our wages policy, by not responding properly to the need for productivity improvements, is still locking inflation in and, whilst real wages may in fact have fallen in four of the last seven years, inflation has not fallen enough. Nor has productivity risen enough. Surely one of the vital keys to breaking that inflationary cycle is labour market reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The small business sector involves some 750,000 business units in Australia, 600,000 of them in the non-farm sector. They contribute around 30 per cent of our gross domestic product and most, in fact around 95 per cent of them, employ less than 20 people. They desperately need the flexibility and the capacity to arrange their own workplace agreements, if they are to realise their huge potential to contribute to the `productivity blow-out', to use a term I have heard before, that this country so desperately needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to cite an interesting example: I have in my electorate a large and efficient machinery workshop which repairs heavy transport and agricultural equipment. This outfit, prior to the introduction of a 38-hour week, had achieved a very high level of workshop efficiency, in terms of the ratio of hours paid to hours booked out, of 64 per cent. In that particular workplace situation doing their particular type of work a 35-hour week was, and remains, hopelessly inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The best that that workshop could manage under a 38-hour week in terms of that particular industry efficiency measure was 52 per cent. That is a drop from 64 per cent to 52 per cent with a loss of two hours labour a week. Under that wages policy outcome productivity, as you may have observed, did not improve. It did not even remain static. It fell and fell badly. </PARA>
<PARA> The managers of that company tell me that they had two choices: they either closed their doors or they returned to a 40-hour week, which is what they did. They pay excessive amounts of overtime and bonus rates to make it worthwhile for people to stay on there, and they charge their clients considerably more for their work. They opted, of course, for that second choice. The result is that hard pressed farmers and transport operators are squeezed even more. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear stories like that all the time out in my rural electorate. I hear people screaming for the capacity to strike their own workplace-relevant agreements. I cannot help but notice that one group in my rural electorate, out in the real world, is not restricted by an award structure struck by a third party miles away both in terms of understanding and geography. That group is farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers know quite a bit about improving productivity. They have led by a big margin the race to do better in Australia and OECD figures will quickly confirm that. Farmers know all about reduced real wages. They know all about multiskilling. They know all about flexibility, and initiative and adaptability. They know how to do more with less because necessity has been for them the mother of much invention. They can show us a great deal about meeting the challenges that confront us as a nation in terms of innovative and realistic responses. They know that many Australians, whether by choice or by virtue of being straitjacketed by some irrelevant award structure, do not work hard enough, long enough, well enough or, in many cases, all three. They know, and we should all know, that we need to do the job more efficiently and to do it better. </PARA>
<PARA> One brief example, admittedly not from the small business sector, will suffice. Our automotive industries are around 50 per cent as efficient as their Japanese and European equivalents. The average number of faults in an Australian car leaving an assembly line is two to three times higher than the number of faults in a car leaving a European or Japanese assembly line. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not only farmers who see our problem. The New South Wales Labor Council published a paper in December of last year which was quite informative and breathtakingly honest. It said in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Productivity increases have not been forthcoming under the accord and therefore real wages growth is impossible under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The outlook for real wages is one of continuing decline. This will further exacerbate disaffection with the accord and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time that the trade union movement, which now represents, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has pointed out, only a little more than 40 per cent of the work force, stopped obstructing-as in so many instances it is still doing-the urgent reforms we need if we are to avoid slipping even further behind. It is high time-in fact, it is well over time-to wean that bull called inflation off his diet. No better place to start exists than to remove the bale of hay called Australian labour market practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) made seems to me to refute quite effectively the whole basis of his argument. That was his concern about the development of the 38-hour week. The 38-hour week came about in 1981-82. There was a wages blow-out in this country. The 38-hour week was part of that structure. The problem was that the previous Government had no way of controlling it. Honourable members opposite were in government at the time and they had no policy structure which could control what was happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not stand here and argue the very sensible views that were put forward on the economy by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I do not think any of us would suggest that foreign debt and inflation are not the two principal worries that face those of us looking at the economy. Our concern should be to turn around that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a new debate. In 1776 Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. The fundamental premise that the father of laissez faire put was that the basic component of the human make-up was self-interest and that self-interest, if pursued unfettered, would lead to the coincidence of public interest and the interest of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a view that we on this side of the House fundamentally reject. That is why we are here and the Opposition is on the other side of the House. We believe that there are legitimate aspirations for workers. There are legitimate aspirations for the Government which, I hope for a democratically elected government like ours, would be in the national interest. There are also legitimate aspirations for employers and business. It is within that structure that we believe the best outcomes can be achieved. That is the fundamental difference between us. It is why we are on this side of the House and the Opposition is on the other side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the national wage case of last year and the structural efficiency principle which is entailed in that, one can see that we are looking for significant improvement. There are only two prospects for Australia at the moment. We can either accept lower living standards or we can improve productivity. I think most people will agree with the premise. I do not find many people coming to me in my electorate suggesting that living standards should fall dramatically. We have to embrace productivity. If one looks at the structural efficiency principle within the national wage case, one finds flowing through it and out of it productivity increases. That is what we have to consider. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Commission has to be satisfied that parties to an award have cooperated positively in a fundamental review of the award and are implementing measures to improve the efficiency of industry and provide workers with access to more varied, fulfilling and better paid jobs. The principles laid down include establishing skill-related career paths, and one finds buzz words like `multiskilling' and `flexibility'. Those are things that we are looking for. They are within the award restructuring program of this Government. They are things that are very important to workers and employers. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the accord, the charge has been made that productivity outcomes are not as good as they could have been. Indeed, the most recent OECD figures show that in manufacturing we match the performance of our OECD partners. Unfortunately-as the honourable member was quite right in suggesting-we need to do better than that. The OECD's most recent report says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . change within the system appears to have been far more marked. The link between wage increases and inflation has been broken. And while the practice of centrally-imposed wage increases has been maintained, the focus of attention has moved to more decentralised negotiations over productivity offsets and changes to award structures. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Although it is too early to assess the final outcome, the initial results in a number of larger awards indicate that changes are clearly going in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA>We are seeing a rebirth in this country of productivity, but it is in its infancy. Honourable members opposite are debasing the debate if they continue to come into this place and say, `We want it fixed tomorrow'. People out in the electorate understand that there cannot be an immediate solution tomorrow. They understand that significant changes are occurring. They understand that over time, if we continue along this path, we have a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative that is put up is to scrap the lot, but that is unfair. What we found during the election campaign and what we continually find on the other side of the house is that the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) cannot agree on this subject. He wants the umpire sometimes and at other times he does not want the umpire. The honourable member for Bennelong wants the umpire none of the time. That is the sort of debate that goes on within the Opposition. On this side of the House we believe that the umpire is an appropriate person to be involved every time. That is what it comes down to. One can have conflict, division and brinkmanship or cooperation, discussion and negotiated agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> If the performance of our industrial relations policy has been so bad, let us look at the results. In a time of sustained employment growth in this country real unit labour costs have fallen by 13 per cent over seven years. We have not been able to achieve that ever before. In regard to industrial disputation, the number of working days lost on average per year for the previous Government's seven years was 3,006,000. In the time of our Government, the figure is 1,425,000-half the former rate of industrial disputation. Days lost per employee have been 591, versus 233. Again that is a reduction of more than half in the number of days lost per employee. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition wants to talk about changing the industrial relations system in a way in which it will get micro- economic reform, it has to suggest something that will work. Our principal objection is that that is what it does not do. If the Opposition wants to look at micro-economic reform, it has to look at its performance in skilling and training the work force. If it wants better and more productive workplaces and productivity increases, it has to have a skilled, trained work force. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Opposition went into the recent election campaign saying that it would cut training. If it wants a more skilled work force and more productivity, it has to train people. Those two things are mutually exclusive. We cannot cut training and at the same time train more people. In Question Time today the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who is sitting at the table, presented the view that 57 per cent of businesses of a particular size spend absolutely nothing on training their work force. I suggest that there is a very significant management problem there. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time we come into this place and talk about micro-economic reform, we find a dead bat from the Opposition. Time and time again it comes in here and plays a dead bat. Last year it was the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, the largest area of public expenditure in health which is blowing out exponentially. We tried to reform the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to improve its efficiency. However, the Opposition suggested paying pharmacists more. </PARA>
<PARA> Our airline system will be deregulated in October this year. The reason the airline have not been able to be deregulated over the last five years is because the Opposition put a straitjacket on the issue. We had to make that decision in 1985. Does the Opposition suggest realistically that under its scheme a bunch of pilots wanting what they wanted would have said, `Oh, sorry, as the Liberal Party is in control we will ask for a 5 per cent rise rather than 30 per cent'? No, they would have asked for 30 per cent and the Opposition would have had no mechanism whereby it could have dealt with it. That is an example of the Opposition's untrammelled approach. Could we have sustained that 30 per cent increase?</PARA>
<PARA> We could go on and on. The Opposition's record on tariffs is not good. It does not work for the Opposition to come into this place and say, `We have a fix. We will break down the system. We will scrap the lot and it will fix itself'. History shows that it does not work. This debate has been going on for 300 years. </PARA>

<PARA> That sessional order 48a (adjournment of House) and standing order 103 (11 o'clock rule) be suspended for all sittings up to and including Thursday, 17 May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion, I very much hope that it will not be necessary to make extensive use of the provision and also that it will be possible to have a number of adjournment debates. However, there is a deal of material to be got through by the end of next week and it is possible that during that period we may need to go an hour or so over time. I do not expect that to be terribly popular, but at this time of the year-if not normally this period into a parliamentary sitting-the suspension of the 11 o'clock rule is pretty normal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is not very much normal about what the Government is seeking to do at this moment. It was an understatement on the part of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) when he said that there is a deal of business to be transacted between now and when it is anticipated the House will rise towards the end of next week. On my count there are now approximately 40 Bills on the Notice Paper and other Bills will be introduced today. I do not know whether it is the Government's intention to introduce additional Bills next Monday. When one considers that 40-plus Bills have to be considered between now and the end of next week, it is no wonder the Government is seeking to suspend the 11 o'clock rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that for the benefit of new members of this House and people throughout Australia who are listening to this broadcast I should indicate the implications of this motion. Normally the House rises at 11 p.m. The adjournment motion is moved by the Minister at the table at 10.30 and then there is an opportunity for private members to raise matters that are of concern to their constituents for a five-minute duration speech for half an hour-that is, from 10.30 to 11 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has just pointed out that he hopes that there will still be some adjournment debates between now and when the House rises at the end of the session. What he did not say of course was that those adjournment debates might be at midnight, 12.30, 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning. After the way he has just raised his eyebrows, it may be 3 or 4 o'clock and we might be having bacon and eggs immediately after the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that this really is not normal. It is normal for the 11 o'clock rule to be suspended towards the end of an ordinary session, but this is no ordinary session. This is the first time that the Parliament has met in 1990. If the sitting pattern is followed, we will meet for three days this week and four days next week. There is already a suggestion that we might meet on Friday of next week as well. I have no objection to that. My complaint is that the House is not meeting enough and that we should meet more frequently. The need for late night sittings should then be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday the sitting pattern for what we term the Budget session was circulated and that indicated that the House will be called together on 21 August, which is particularly late. Presumably the Government intends to bring down the Budget on 21 August. If that sitting pattern is followed we will sit for another 27 days. If we add together the three days of this week-keeping in mind that one was taken up largely by ceremonial matters-and, say, four days next week and 27 days after the Budget is introduced in August, this Parliament will sit for only 34 days in 1990. If Friday week is added it will be 35 days. That is a disgrace. As I said in an earlier address in this session, the Government is contemptuous of this Parliament. By being contemptuous of the Parliament it is, of course, contemptuous of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not oppose or vote against the motion before the House to suspend the 11 o'clock rule because we know that this business has to be dealt with and we do not have the numbers in the House of Representatives to keep it sitting longer. If we had the numbers we would use them to ensure that the House sat longer. As I said in an earlier address, we have an increased number of members of Parliament-148 in the House of Representatives-since 1984 when Parliament was enlarged, and we are sitting for shorter periods. Therefore, there are reduced opportunities for members to bring forward matters of concern to their constituencies and also reduced opportunities to consider legislation and speak to it. </PARA>
<PARA> As I conclude, I remind the House and others who might be listening to this broadcast that this week we have had examples of very complex legislation being brought in on one day and dealt with the following day and it has not been possible to scrutinise it properly. Parliament has a number of functions. Surely one of those functions is to scrutinise the legislation brought in by the Executive government. As I said a moment ago, the Government is contemptuous of this Parliament and it should not be suspending the 11 o'clock rule at this stage. Rather it should be advising us of its intention to sit for a longer period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill and Training Guarantee Bill are a package of measures that need to be read together. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier drafts of the Bills and explanatory materials were released for public comment at the time the previous Parliament was dissolved. The many comments that were received have been considered and have resulted in some amendments to the Bills. Other changes have also been made to clarify particular provisions of the earlier drafts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges in particular the positive contribution of the Australian Democrats in suggesting ways to assist employers meet their obligations through the services of industry training agents and possible exemptions for employers which are outstanding trainers. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Macklin in this exercise, who supports what the Government is trying to do here and has cooperated with us in drafting it. I hope that he will also cooperate in relation to securing its passage through the Senate. I might say that it will be a pity when Senator Macklin leaves the Senate. He is going to be Leader of the Australian Democrats for only a brief time, and I think both the Democrats and the Senate are going to miss him when he goes. </PARA>
<PARA> While the level of public awareness of the need for increased and better quality training has improved over the past year, the level of training has not. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in April this year indicate that there has been no significant growth in structured training from the levels estimated for the same period in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee Bill requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training, broadly defined. The Government believes that employers should spend the money themselves in ways which they consider will maximise productivity or contribute more generally to the skills of the work force. However, where employers spend less than the required minimum, the shortfall will be collected and used to fund additional training activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government aims, of course, to collect nothing. When we do collect nothing we will have succeeded in ensuring that the level of training by enterprises has in fact been lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a targeted measure aimed at improving the efforts of firms which do not currently invest in training or invest very little in training. The Government favours this scheme partly because it will not penalise those companies which have recognised the value of training and invest in it accordingly. For firms that already train above the required minimum level it will have no direct financial impact. The training guarantee is in fact a charge on the failure to train. </PARA>
<PARA> Structural adjustment and increasing the competitiveness of Australian industry have been major concerns of this Government. It is widely accepted that this will require a more highly skilled and flexible work force. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the Government has undertaken major reforms to the education and training systems. Changes to the higher education system have substantially increased its capacity and made it more responsive to national goals. The Government has, jointly with the States and Territories, undertaken a major overhaul of the training system to improve the quality of training provided and the efficiency and responsiveness of the training system. These initiatives include reform to the way in which technical and further education is funded; the move to competency-based training; the establishment of the National Training Board to develop nationally consistent skills standards; and providing assistance for innovative industry training arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In parallel, the Government has encouraged improvements to work organisations and worker productivity through award restructuring. This process is creating new opportunities and incentives for both workers and employers to invest in improving workplace skills. It is important that these opportunities for industrial reform are not wasted. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Government discussion papers have drawn attention to Australia's unsatisfactory level of industry training. In the publications Skills for Australia published in September 1987, and A Changing Workforce, published in May 1988, the point that was emphasised was the importance of industry investment in training. These publications expressed concern about the level of industry effort in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> This was followed in December 1988 by the Government's discussion paper entitled Industry Training in Australia: The Need for Change. The paper found that, while some employers have excellent training programs, many more do not. It analysed the level of expenditure on training by industry and examined some of the reasons why this was not higher. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the release of the discussion paper, the Employment and Skills Formation Council (ESFC) of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training was requested to undertake consultations with all interested parties and report on measures to improve industry training. Wide-ranging consultations ensued from which there emerged a high level of agreement that the existing level and quality of training was inadequate. The scheme embodied in these Bills is a modified version of that recommended by the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to change industry attitudes to training from the present situation where too many firms regard training as a cost to be minimised, to one where it is seen as an investment to improve the flexibility and quality of skills and hence to achieve more productive outcomes. We need also to improve the quality of training by increasing the incidence of structured, planned training. Finally, we need to ensure that there is a more equitable distribution of training effort amongst employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The training guarantee is designed to address these requirements. It will `lift the tail' of industry training by targeting those employers who are currently not training. In this way it will help reduce the disincentive for other employers to train created by firms that rely predominantly on poaching for their supply of skilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The training guarantee extends to the Commonwealth, State and Territory public sectors as well as the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers with annual national payrolls of $200,000 or more-which is around eight to 10 full-time employees-will be required to spend the equivalent of one per cent of their payroll on eligible training activities from 1 July 1990, rising to 1.5 per cent from 1 July 1992 and thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition of training is intentionally broad to give employers the flexibility to acquit their obligation in a wide range of ways. A key concept is the development of structured training programs, which identify in advance the skills to be acquired, the mechanisms by which they will be imparted and the means for identifying outcomes or productivity improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> Industrial relations training, occupational health and safety training and study leave for teachers and academics are examples of some of the types and range of training that would be counted within an overall training program. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there are many other possibilities for meeting the expenditure requirement, including donations to tertiary education institutions, industry skill centres, industry training bodies and community-based training schemes; the establishment and maintenance of associated training facilities and information systems; and contributions to industry specific training levies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of consultations industry convincingly argued that on-the-job training had an important role in their training strategies. At the same time, there is strong industry support for the move to competency-based training. Hence, both on-the-job and off-the-job structured training are included in eligible training activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The definition does, however, draw a line between structured training on the one side and unstructured, informal training on the other. While informal training and work experience continue to have a role in building workplace skills, the training guarantee is focused on structured training. </PARA>
<PARA> Training is not restricted to non-managerial employees. Management training-and training for owner-managers-is just as important in raising the productive capacity of Australian industry and to changing attitudes to training. Expenditure on management's own training, provided it meets the other eligibility requirements, will count. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is training limited to management and other workers within an enterprise. While it is expected that employers will generally make the bulk of their expenditure on their own work force, scholarships, cadetships and structured training for those not currently in the work force are to be eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be stressed that the training guarantee is a minimum spending requirement: it is not intended to be an industry average or norm and for much of Australian industry it is certainly not an optimum level of training expenditure. To reinforce this point the Government will investigate, in further consultation with industry, the possibility of recognising those firms-regrettably few in number-which have an outstanding commitment to training and to simplify the accountability required of them under the training guarantee. Those arrangements may require amendments to the legislation, which would be brought forward in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA> Exemptions will be given to the following organisations: international organisations; foreign government representatives; public benevolent institutions (except public hospitals) and religious institutions, as they relate to pastoral duties. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has already been made to the fact that only firms with payrolls of $200,000 or more will be required to meet the training guarantee. This threshold level means that around 75 per cent of the private sector non-agricultural work force will be covered by the training guarantee, while excluding about 85 per cent of employers-that is, those employers with a very small number of employees. The threshold will be indexed to average weekly earnings. During the consultative process, many have argued that there should be no exemptions for smaller firms. However, the Government recognises the special difficulties and needs of very small businesses. While they are to be exempt from any compulsory requirement, the Employment and Skills Formation Council has been asked to further examine small business training needs and to advise on measures to improve the training effort of small business. It has been argued that an exemption for firms with a payroll below $200,000 is, in effect, an exemption for all firms spending less than the proposed minimum requirement. This is not correct. Recent Australian Bureau of Statistics data show that almost 60 per cent of enterprises with annual payrolls over $200,000 spent nothing on formal training. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers and employees have a collective interest in the productivity of their enterprises and in the availability of training. While the legislation does not require them to do so, there would be value in employers informing their work force on their training strategy and expenditure on training. The Government is also concerned that low-skilled workers, women and disadvantaged labour market groups have access to training. While it has decided not to include specific training targets for such groups, it will be monitoring industry training behaviour. The extent to which training is distributed across all groups in the work force will be considered in the context of reviewing the operation of the scheme. The review will occur within four years of the commencement of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for administering the training guarantee is to lie with the Commissioner of Taxation. The scheme will be administered on a self-assessment basis, combined with auditing of a sample of employers. All employers to whom the training guarantee applies will be required to keep appropriate records for the purposes of assessing whether they have a liability and for auditing purposes. However, only those employers who have failed to spend the required minimum on eligible training activities in any financial year will be required to furnish a statement to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), together with payment of a charge equal to any shortfall. In this way the scheme will minimise the administrative burden on industry and the level of bureaucratic involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that there is also a need for an agency to advise on guidelines for eligible training expenditure and to deal with issues of interpretation with respect to the definition of training and related matters. The agreement of the States and Territories will be sought for the National Training Board to fulfil these roles. In order to assist employers to meet their expenditure obligations directly, the Government will also make provision for industry training bodies and industry associations to act as registered industry training agents. The national training agency will be empowered to register industry bodies which elect to take on the role of training agents. </PARA>
<PARA> Training agents will have the capacity to advise employers within a particular industry on eligible training programs and related expenditure and provide certificates if a particular program is eligible. A certificate issued by a registered industry agent will be accepted by Australian Taxation Office auditors as evidence of program eligibility. Guidelines on the criteria to be used in registering and monitoring industry agents will be tabled in the coming months and it is expected they will be operational on or before 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office will provide advice on routine inquiries with respect to eligible training. On other matters relating to eligible training it will seek rulings and advice. The training advisory agency, which, as I say, we hope will be the National Training Board, will provide such advice to the ATO and to the industry training agents. The Government's purpose is not to collect revenue. The Government anticipates that the level of revenue collected will quickly decline as employers increase their own training expenditure. This is in line with the Government's objective of encouraging employers themselves to make the required investment in training. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue collected under the training guarantee will be placed in a special trust account under a standing appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. All revenue net of administration and monitoring costs will be disbursed to the States and Territories which support the training guarantee and agree to disburse their share of revenue on training on the advice of an appropriate tripartite body and in a way that does not substitute for existing State or Federal Government expenditure. The Government expects that this revenue will add to the pool of money available for funding innovative training arrangements. Where a State or Territory does not agree to the above funding conditions, or terminates its agreement, the Commonwealth will use that share of funds for additional training activities. Funds will be allocated according to a State or Territory's share of national payroll, as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I present the consolidated explanatory memorandum for this Bill and the Training Guarantee Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1990) and Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1990). </PARA>
<PARA>The tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921, and the Customs Tariff (Uranium Export Duty) Act 1980. The proposals formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the recent recess. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1990), operative on and from 1 April 1990, increases the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from a rate of free to $5.78 per kilolitre. This change was announced by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) on 22 March 1990. Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1990), operative on and from 21 February 1990, increases the export duty on concentrate produced from uranium ore obtained from the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. The duty is increased from $1.15 to $1.30 per kilogram and was foreshadowed in the 1988-89 Budget Papers. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I would like to convey my congratulations, along with those of previous speakers in this House, on the re-election of the Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I am also mindful, as I stand before this House with considerable pride in this historic fourth term of the Hawke Labor Government, that the trust that has been granted to me by the people of my electorate is enormous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to place on record my sincere appreciation of the work done by the men and women of the Australian Labor Party branches within my electorate who gave so generously of their time not only in the election period itself but leading up to the campaign. The support, help and assistance from my husband, Ivo, my close family and my personal friends will always be remembered and appreciated by me. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like particularly to express my appreciation to my predecessor in this House, Dr Dick Klugman, who served as the first member for Prospect from 1969. I know Dick would appreciate this in the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:</PARA>
<PARA> Each morning sees some task begun</PARA>
<PARA> Each evening sees it close,</PARA>
<PARA> Something attempted, something done,</PARA>
<PARA> Has earned a night's repose. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish him well in his future endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had the good fortune of living within my electorate for the last 33 years and, through local and State government, of sharing in the development and transformation of one of the most dynamic areas in Australia. History records that Arthur Phillip, the first Governor of New South Wales, sighted the area of Prospect three months after the landing of the First Fleet. In a dispatch of 15 May 1788 he described Prospect as a `country that may be cultivated with ease' and, in an attempt to relieve the critical food shortage of the colony in 1792, granted land to emancipated convicts, which brought the first white settlers to Prospect. Captain Watkin Finch was stationed near the Prospect settlement in its first year and his journal records many of the difficulties and hardships faced by the pioneering farmers. Prospect is an area experiencing rapid growth and change. The farms have gone and they have been replaced by industrial development, and modern homes have replaced poultry and vegetable gardens. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate is not monolingual. It has nearly 50 per cent of the population born overseas from 100 different nations who have made the area their home. Each group has a particular identity and distinctiveness, enriching the culture of the community. It is a truly multicultural electorate and it has benefited greatly from the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to a multicultural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> President Kennedy once said of the United States of America: `We are a nation of immigrants'. It is also an apt description of Australia. From the convict days to the settlers, then to the unprecedented immigration program started by a Labor Government in 1947, our immigration program has been and is one of the largest in the world. The result is that today Australia has one of the most cosmopolitan populations in the world. Only Israel has a larger foreign-born work force than Australia. In national terms 40 per cent of Australians are the product of postwar migration. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of this immigration program can be seen today in most aspects of social, economic and artistic life in our country, and in my electorate of Prospect in particular. History shows us that the melting pot policy of assimilation did not work. Thank goodness that past governments learned by those mistakes and introduced a policy of multiculturalism. In the words of our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke): `Multiculturalism sees diversity as a strength, social justice as a necessity and the development of human resources as the basis of our economic future'. The Prime Minister also stated: `My Government will not retreat from its commitment to multiculturalism'. He said that to do so-as some of our opponents have done-would be to disown and offend all of those Australians who have come here from overseas and whose loyalty and commitment to this country have never been questioned by him or his Government. The Prime Minister also stated that he is committed to making better use of immigrants' skills, education and entrepreneurial drive. We are committed to maintaining and developing our language resources in order to advance Australia's trade, tourism and diplomatic interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1983 we had in existence a system which denied immigrants from non-English-speaking countries adequate opportunity to learn English. The fundamental importance of English language fluency and literacy to the individual, society and the economy is now widely understood within the community and is actively supported by Government programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcomed the Government's announcement last year that it would be making major improvements to the adult migrant education program. This important program provides English language training to newly arrived migrants, many of whom, as I have said, settled within my electorate. It is undoubtedly the case that a knowledge of English is crucial to the success of the migration process. Research shows that migrants who learn English soon after they arrive in Australia find it easier to obtain a job which utilises their skills, to have their qualifications recognised and to enjoy social interaction with other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the objectives of the Government's three-year national plan for the adult migrant education program which are to bring migrants' English to a level that would optimise their ability to function well in Australia, to ensure cooperation with other agencies so that language skills are recognised for employment purposes and to provide additional measures to help those people, particularly women with young children, who have trouble attending classes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, given that my electorate is essentially multicultural, you can understand and appreciate the problems that my constituents have encountered from so-called immigration consultants who charge prices ranging from $700 to fill in a form to $5,000 to make representations to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs on their behalf. I find the actions of these so-called consultants repugnant as they play on the anxiety of people who, through lack of knowledge, do not know where to go for help and assistance. I give notice now in this my first speech in this House that I will vigorously pursue this matter to see what action can be taken to have this activity stopped. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1986 our census showed that 36 per cent of the population of Prospect was under the age of 15. With such a young population, issues of education and training are of vital importance. Within my electorate I have eight public high schools and three Catholic high schools and these schools are forced to deal with unique problems. For instance, at Canley Vale High School there are over 1,000 students who collectively speak at home 42 languages other than English; this is not atypical. The problems that these schools confront are not related to discipline. They arise from the transient nature of the schools' population, the poor performance in English and the lack of funding for and non-availability of English as a second language teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has committed itself to engendering a more highly educated and skilled population as the foundation of an inquiring, adaptable, innovative, equitable and productive society. The Government sees the key to achieving this goal as through the increasing number of students completing year 12 at high school. I endorse those objectives. However, the challenge for the schools in my electorate is not to increase the year 12 retention rate; they already well exceed the 1989 national rate of 61 per cent. The challenge for these schools is to find constructive and meaningful subjects for the students who either are not academically geared or who simply do not have the English language skills to study in years 11 and 12. I hope that these issues are being taken into consideration in the curriculum reform and the development of a common curriculum which is taking place as a result of the Hawke Labor Government's emphasis on the need for a national perspective on schooling. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to acknowledge the financial contributions that this Government has made to schools in the electorate of Prospect. In 1989 some $9m was expended on the disadvantaged schools program, ethnic schools, capital grants for new places, as well as upgrading facilities. Since coming to office, the Government has allocated over $4m in capital grants to the electorate of Prospect. As the number of young people going on to years 11 and 12 at high school is rapidly increasing, it is essential that students in the western suburbs of Sydney have the opportunity to study in quality technical and further education (TAFE) facilities as well as higher education facilities within their own area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government has significantly contributed to the Wetherill Park Technical and Further Education College, a much needed facility within my electorate which opened its doors in 1981; in fact, it is the only higher college in the electorate of Prospect. I was pleased that in 1988 Minister Dawkins recognised the growing demand for TAFE and higher education in the west and south-western suburbs by committing the Government to spending more than $150m on TAFE and higher education buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to signal my wholehearted approval of our Labor Government's $55m commitment establishing the University of Western Sydney. It would be very hard to overestimate the benefits such a facility provides not just for the people of Prospect, but for the whole enormous community that makes up Sydney's greater west. I refer not only to the obvious educational benefits and the encouragement it will provide for young people to aim for a tertiary education, but also to the psychological boost it will give to the people of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Hawke Labor Government's policies of linking education and training to the labour market we have a highly successful Skillshare project in Prospect-Mission Employment, Fairfield. The project has been operating for just over a year and offers structured skills courses in professional sales, computers, and office skills for migrants. As the new member for Prospect, I recently attended a graduation ceremony at Mission Employment, Fairfield. I was impressed at the commitment and professionalism of the staff, the project's facilities and the enthusiasm of the participants. Society cannot afford to ignore the claims of those of its members who need the most help. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government's policies, aimed at developing a fairer and more just society, have seen major improvements in the social security system, including cash assistance to the disadvantaged. One of the greatest advantages has been the historic restructuring of family payments, including the simplification of, and substantial increase in, family allowance payments; the targeting of support to lowest income families through the introduction of the family allowances supplement; the setting of standards for family payments for those most in need, and the payment of them directly to the mother on a regular basis; and the Government's commitment to the indexation of family payments. This has truly helped my electorate. In fact, the constituents of Prospect have benefited substantially from this commitment to improving the lot of families, especially low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate 34,533 children from 17,397 families are the recipients of family allowance and 2,900 children from 1,124 families are the recipients of the family allowance supplement. This makes Prospect one of the federal electorates with the most number of family assistance recipients. In fact, it is one of the top 10 electorates in Australia with the largest number of families benefiting from this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the living standards of families are not only dependent on government payments, but on the provision of services such as child-care. Prospect has directly benefited from the Hawke Labor Government's policies which have resulted in the creation of 68,000 child-care places since 1983. Six federally funded child-care centres have been established within my electorate. In an electorate such as mine where in many families both parents work, often in low paid jobs, there still exists a great demand for child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> While I applaud the Government's commitment to being the main provider of child-care, I believe that there is a need to examine alternative ways to meet this demand. Since government, industry and the community stand to gain from the availability of quality child-care, they should all play a part in making it a reality. </PARA>
<PARA> A report by the Office of the Status of Women, launched by the Prime Minister in August last year, entitled Child Care at Work: A Cost Benefit Study of Employer Provided Child Care estimated the cost of providing a child-care centre and identified the substantial benefits to employers in terms of reduced labour turnover, absenteeism costs, tax concessions, improved industrial relations, and improved corporate image. In regard to encouraging workplace child-care the industry program component of the national child-care strategy is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The program includes incentives to encourage industry to invest in the provision of child-care for their employees. Commonwealth assistance in the form of a contribution towards fee relief has been designed to give the greatest support to industries with high proportions of low income workers. I understand that initial interest in the program has been substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> Employer provided child-care is an issue which the Labor Government should continue to pursue and particularly be backed by the labour movement. I believe that the role of the Federal Labor Government should be to use every means at its disposal to encourage employers to provide child-care, including setting an example by providing workplace child-care for its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said in a policy speech on 8 March this year that Australia can no longer be content to be just a lucky country, we must become the clever country. While the Prime Minister was referring to education and scientific research, I am referring to the issue of child-care. A clever country does not deny a large percentage of its population access to the work force and therefore waste a valuable resource simply because it cannot provide quality child-care. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many highly educated, skilled and experienced mothers out there whom we need back in the work force contributing to the economy and who would like to make a contribution but are unable to do so because of the absence of reasonable child-care alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other concerns I wish to bring up in my first speech. Time will not permit it, as I see, so I will touch on one concern; that is, post office facilities within my electorate. While appreciating that as a government business enterprise Australia Post makes its own commercial and management decisions within the context of legislative requirements and government policies, and that day-to-day running of the organisation is normally a matter dealt with by Australia Post management, as the Federal member for Prospect I am certainly aiming to redress a problem which, although basic, is of concern to my constituents. I refer to the total inadequacy of the facilities at Fairfield Post Office. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to stress that I am referring to the physical building and am in no way reflecting on the very efficient staff at Fairfield who perform their duties under very trying conditions and who have even attempted a number of innovations to relieve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing post office building was opened in 1962, at which time the population of the municipality of Fairfield was 84,000. Our city currently has a population in excess of 180,000 and remains one of the fastest growing local government areas in New South Wales. It is not unusual for customers at Fairfield Post Office to queue for an hour as a result of the inadequate facilities. In fact, the queue has often extended out the front door of the post office and down the street-a queue worthy of a Moscow food market. Again, this is no reflection on the Australia Post staff. </PARA>
<PARA> While Australia Post acknowledges that the Fairfield Post Office building is inadequate and advises that it is examining all available possible solutions, I am firmly of the belief that the people of Fairfield have a right to the adequate provision of such a basic service and that immediate action needs to be taken by Australia Post to alleviate the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am looking forward to the challenge of representing the people of Prospect in this place and achieving results for them. I am also looking forward to being a member of the Fourth Hawke Labor Government and contributing to the enrichment of the ideals of social justice in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) has said, it is often stated in Australia that we are a lucky country. It has been said so many times and repeated so many times that many in this country have started to take it for granted, to accept it and to believe it. I fear that it has made us all a bit soft. It has made us far too complacent about our economic and political circumstances and prospects. When times get tough there is usually a tendency on the part of a lot of Australians to take the view that something will always pop up to turn things around, to minimise the damage of difficult times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that we have been on occasions in recent years quite lucky, sufficiently lucky at least, to muddle through. But we must be careful not to confuse good luck with good management, as the Government is often inclined to do. Good management is essential if we are to be in a position where we can capitalise most effectively on good luck. To do otherwise means that we fail to reach our full potential as we have done so many times in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now, for example, in Australia there is a view that has emerged that our luck is about to continue. Even though we are in difficult economic circumstances we are uniquely placed on the edge of what will be the fastest growing region in the world, the Asia Pacific region, through to the early decades of the next century. There is a belief that, `She'll be right', that we do not have to face the difficult economic and political choices that would otherwise be advocated for a country in our circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Any objective assessment of our current circumstances would have to emphasise that we have slipped a very long way in recent years. We are no longer a major trading nation. Our standard of living no longer reigns anywhere near the top few, as it did, in the world. Our international credit standing has been downgraded twice in the last three years. There is little evidence to support the view that our luck will continue even though we are so uniquely placed on the edge of that Asia Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economic circumstances are the most difficult we have seen in the post-war period, if not since the Great Depression. The process of international change that is under way now is unexpectedly significant. It is unexpectedly fast and it is noticeably less predictable than has been the case for much of the post-war period. We cannot afford, therefore, in those circumstances to continue to rely on luck. We must recognise the magnitude of our problems in a very objective way and set about to lift our economic performance and reassess our strategic and regional significance in the years to come. We talk, for example, at home about becoming a banana republic. We should not be too surprised if some of our neighbours start to think of us pretty much in those terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we moved a motion in relation to Gallipoli and talked about the sacrifices that were made by the Anzacs, the sort of country that they fought for and the international legend that they created. It should cause us to pause and to think whether we built and are in the process of building the sort of country that they really fought for all those years ago, as so many others have fought since. </PARA>
<PARA> Today at the beginning of a new Parliament in the final decade of this century I think it is very important that we stop and ask ourselves a few fundamental questions and identify a few major challenges for ourselves. To me there would be three major challenges that ought to be addressed in the course of the next few years in this country. Firstly, we need to take a national stocktake of where we are, that is, a realistic assessment of where this country is and where is it likely to go under present policies. Secondly, I think we need to forge a national vision and a national strategy that might be pursued to achieve that vision. Thirdly, and most importantly, there has to be a significant shift in the basic attitudes of all levels of Australians so that we can make a national commitment to actually do what needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of those challenges I was particularly disappointed in what I heard by way of a speech delivered by the Governor-General here on Tuesday. In our current circumstances we could do little less than conclude that this Hawke-Keating Government has sadly let this country down over seven years. I personally believe that history will judge very poorly for its performance. </PARA>
<PARA> If we do a stocktake at the present time I think we would have to focus on a number of key features. The country has basically moved into recession. It is in a position of stagflation, with rising unemployment. Inflation is presently locked in at about 8 3/4 per cent. Unemployment is projected to rise steadily over the next six to 12 months. It could reach 7 3/4 per cent. The high interest rate policies of the Government have sent record levels of small businesses broke, increased personal bankruptcies to record levels and left many Australian families struggling under the weight of unsustainably high home loan mortgage repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> Our current account is locked in at about 5 per cent of gross domestic product, broadly double the level people used to think was the maximum sustainable level for the current account deficit. Our international debt stands at $148m. </PARA>
<PARA> As each month goes by, as with the last balance of payments data, we get further evidence of just how far this country has slipped as a result of poor economic management. I guess we have further evidence as well that interest rates will not come down in the near term. They are unlikely to come down by much more than a half to one per cent over the rest of this year which will only compound the magnitude of the difficulties faced by most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a sad tendency emerging in this country where Australians are giving up, as evidenced most recently by the rush into fixed interest mortgage loans. We could not have imagined a situation a few years ago where people would rush into five year mortgage interest rate money at 15 per cent. That is one of the best commentaries I have seen in recent days of the extent to which people have given up. What is disturbing about that is that while it is bad in Australia, while our recession is here, it is home grown. It has occurred at a time where we have had quite favourable circumstances in the international economy. We are now in such difficult circumstances that we are left particularly vulnerable to any adverse developments that might come from off-shore. </PARA>
<PARA> We now see growth slowing in the world economy. We see pressures on international stock markets, shakeouts in international debt markets, concerned by the Group of Seven countries about the lack of structural adjustment in the major players of the international world. Of course, we see progress stalling on international trade talks. We see persistent fiscal and trade imbalances among the major countries. We see a significant shift in the allocation of global savings towards eastern Europe, a potential focus for investment, and away from countries that are less substantial performers. The implications of all that for a country like Australia are phenomenal. If the growth slows our export prices fall and our export market shrinks. If there is a flight to quality in international debt markets this country is particularly vulnerable in domestic circumstances where the pain on the average Australian has already reached unbelievable levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The realities of economic life in Australia have a number of other important dimensions that should be recognised. Our capital infrastructure, that is, our roads, water, sewerage, and some of our electricity generation facilities, are in decline and substantially run down. The costs of our health care system are spiralling out of control. Our education system is dispirited and uncertain about its future as the growing tendency or preference for private education tends to confirm. Many State governments are in crisis financially as a result of very poor economic management, most noticeably Western Australia and Victoria. Our immigration program has been thrown into total confusion by ministerial and bureaucratic decisions which have only had the aim of short term politically expedient responses. Much the same could be said about the approach to the environment, the eyes being on votes, not on the true interests of those who are green and the independence of many of our national institutions. Institutions such as the Public Service, the Reserve Bank of Australia, and indeed, the Industrial Relations Commission have been seriously compromised by the attitudes of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet when one turns to the Governor-General's Speech and looks for guidance as to what the Government's program is in these economic and social areas, one finds little joy. The only thing one can say with confidence is that Senator Walsh's assessment of the situation is pretty accurate. The Government has engineered the problems, the Government does not have any vision and the Government does not have any guts to put in place the policies that are required to turn this place around. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech made the other day was very important in giving us, basically, a list of all the things the Government will not do rather than the things the Government will do. For example, it will not be implementing a coherent and determined strategy to reduce inflation or our foreign debt. It will not provide us with a new and realistic set of forecasts of the Australian economy-no statement of where we are going, even in the course of the next few years. It will not review our tax structure. It will not address issues like the consumption tax, most recently ridiculed by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is quite happy for people to persist with interest rates at 15 3/4 or 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There is low incentive, low savings and low productivity. The Government is quite happy to rule out all those sorts of options. It will not reform the current wage system. Indeed, the trends are the wrong way, they are towards large, powerful unions, the focus more and more centralised and less and less towards the enterprise level where it ought to be going and where it is easier to achieve rewards more readily matched to performance, and employees and employers can look after each others benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It will not reduce government expenditure any further. It will not allow a rational debate on the immigration intake in Australia. It will not abandon its centralised control over our educational structures. It will not reform inappropriate industry policy. It will not consider the necessary reforms in a host of key areas that are fundamental to boosting our productive capacity and our export potential and offer us the way of trading out of our difficulties. For example, it will not introduce competition in a significant way into the aviation and telecommunications industries. It will not accelerate genuine reform on the waterfront and has ruled out a program of privatising government enterprises and exposing them to the full force of market competition. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not have a program to restore our deteriorating capital infrastructure. It will not consider ways in which the private sector can become involved in the provision of that infrastructure. Of course, in the health area it will not address some of the basic questions of our deteriorating health system thereby putting the financing of health services on a rational basis. It will not help to correct the imbalances between public and private funding. It will not do anything about the chronic rationing of hospital services which is part and parcel of the Medicare system and will increasingly be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of that speech the other day anyone in Australia would need to be particularly concerned about the extent to which the Government did not offer any solutions to the emerging economic and social problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This deteriorating economic performance is spilling over into other areas, in particular, foreign policy. Australia's capacity to assume a more significant role in the Asia-Pacific region, for example, and to interact more beneficially with its continuing rapid economic growth continues to deteriorate because we are seen as unable to compete in that region. We are losing our way in what is a dramatically changing world. Our foreign policy has no sense of vision, it has got no clear basis of where national interests lie and it has no defined ordering of priorities. All we have is high rhetoric without substance and an attempt to maintain a high international profile without regard to our real national interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990s will see a number of major readjustments in the balance of power in international affairs as a result of a host of factors, the more important of which might include the collapse of communism as an effective system of government in eastern Europe; the upheavals resulting from attempted modernisation in the Soviet Union and China; the American reassessment of its international role; the process of internationalisation at work in Japan; the momentum towards integration in Europe; the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole-as I mentioned, the major growth centre for the next 30 to 40 years-the ongoing debt problems of many Third World countries; and, of course, the difficult economic challenges being faced by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and other near neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> All these developments will have a vital implication for Australia and its economic and security interests over the next decade and beyond. But where is the Government's assessment of these implications? What is its strategy for responding to them? Where is its vision of our international status in the year 2000?</PARA>
<PARA> One would look in vain in the speech made the other day for any idea as to where we are going. The less ideological and polarised international environment of this post-Cold War era, as welcome as it is, does not necessarily ensure greater security and stability for all nations. For example, the great liberalising changes in European communism are not yet evident in the Asia-Pacific region. An effective defence infrastructure and regional cooperation will, therefore, continue to be an important priority for Australia through the 1990s but where, in the speech made by the Governor-General the other day, is the blueprint for effective national security at a time when the comfortable security assumptions of the post war period are giving way to a much more fluid set of alignments?</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that government policy will continue to be guided, for example, by the 1987 Defence White Paper. Yet the Government has not achieved the target ratio of spending to gross domestic product specified in that paper and senior defence personnel have indicated that our defence policy may soon be reviewed. What is the situation? Nothing is said. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor did the speech show a sense of purpose and direction on broader international issues. How is Australia to position itself to deal with the changing patterns of international trade alignments that are now taking place? For example, what are the prospects for bilateralism and multilateralism in world trade? How will the outcome of the Glasnost and Perestroika policies in the Soviet Union, and the fate of modernisation in China, impact on our region? The speech was decidedly devoid of detail on these and many other issues in the international area in relation to security, foreign affairs and defence. </PARA>

It has none because it focuses entirely on its own short term political survival. It has no vision for advancing Australia's real national interest in the region and the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A recent example of that in the area of foreign affairs is the events in recent days in the Asia-Pacific area. The Government has missed two coups that occurred in Fiji. During the election campaign the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) went off to Namibia to see Mandela. He has not spent much time in Bougainville, and when he did go to Papua New Guinea he offended people there. The Government recently announced its decision to sell Mirage jets to Pakistan at the very time that tensions between Pakistan and India over Kashmir are rising. The Government has no medium term foreign affairs, defence or security strategy to speak of. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern, in these circumstances, is the total lack of vision, the total lack of policies and the total lack of capacity to carry them out. I put to the House the suggestion that what we really need is a complete rethink of where we are and where we are going along the lines of the three challenges that I identified. The country is crying out for a national vision to carry us through this decade into the early part of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we can and should emerge as a major economic and political force in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2000. It is a challenge that will involve us all as individuals, corporations, governments and various types of organisations and groups within Australia. What everybody should do today, as an exercise at this time-at the start of the last decade of this century-is to begin a process of thinking about the sort of country they would like to build by the year 2000, and the sort of economic, industrial, environmental, social and security structure they would like to see that country have. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the main challenge that I believe we should look to at the present time. We should encourage everybody in this country to think about where they would like to be, what sort of country they would like to have by the year 2000-and from there move backwards to the detailed specifications of the sorts of policy changes that will be required in order to turn this country around. </PARA>
<PARA> The trends are all in the wrong direction; many of them are unsustainable and will bring with them substantial and radical social change. This should not be forced; it should not be unexpected; it should be managed. The smart government is the one that perceives the direction in which this country should go and manages it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am most honoured to be afforded the opportunity to deliver this, to use sexist language, my maiden speech as the representative of the fine people of Adelaide in this great chamber. Named after the German-born consort of William IV, the seat of Adelaide has been represented by 11 members including me since its creation in 1903. They have varied in age, weight and size, but for 75 per cent of that time the electors have returned radical or Labor members-all blokes, I am afraid. Among the best known remains the first: Charles Cameron Kingston, who has a suburb near here named after him, a former Premier of South Australia, active federationist and radical reformer. Well known for first offering to duel with a conservative with pistols and later beating a bourgeois assailant with his own whip, he had a long string of radical achievements deserving emulation, including the franchise for women and a state bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not, however, intend to follow his advocacy of a white Australia, or what my old colleague John Playford describes in The Dictionary of National Biography as his `lechery'. But his reputation as one of the greatest Australians, a tremendous reformer, and a wild man to boot, must still excite some envy. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1908 Kingston was succeeded by Ernie Roberts, a radical union official born in London. My accent notwithstanding, I was born in Wales to a coal mining family-and I do not mean by that that we owned the mine. My mother's maiden name was, however, Roberts and some distant relationship may be searched at some future time. I am proud to note that Roberts's wife established the first State women's branch of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the suburb of Prospect, where my wife Pat, whom I see in the gallery, and I have lived and brought up two sons since 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> For the next 80 years Labor mostly held Adelaide, save during the 1930s Depression and Labor's splits, and following the khaki election of 1966. I first campaigned in the seat in 1969 for Labor's candidate Chris Hurford. I lived down in solid Labor Gilles Plains but I was put on the city booth where my Liberal equivalent was a Cabinet Minister in the State Government. She complained at that time that we intended to make homosexuality legal; I assured her we would make it compulsory. Despite my best efforts, Chris won a very comfortable victory which was followed by one of the thousands of `Don's parties' up and down the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor held Adelaide through the peaks of 1972 and 1974 and hung on in the debacles of 1975 and 1977. A redistribution so consolidated Labor's hold for the 1980s we thought we had it but we lost it in the 1988 by-election. Now Adelaide is a special seat. It is essentially a microcosm of urban Australia, which explains why honourable members opposite often live in the seat but cannot get elected from it. </PARA>
<PARA> It contains the inner northern working class suburbs of the city where most of my voters live, but also encompasses the leafy glades of North Adelaide, Walkerville and St Peters and the Labor voting central business district and city square mile. It is the most charming city of the many I have visited, which is why I volunteered in 1968 to spend my life there and make my children, and probably theirs, Adelaideans. In this place I hope to repay my resulting debt to the many kind people who befriended the Catleys and then voted this one into the most honourable of positions to which a citizen can aspire: a poor but honest parliamentary backbencher. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor lost the seat in 1988 because we perpetrated every then known mistake of political campaigning, and invented a few more. Our heartland did not vote very much; when it did it swung against us, more in sorrow than in anger, and more in protest than in purpose. I had, Mr Deputy Speaker, at that time no intention to aspire to this seat which someone has kindly allocated to me. I did however deeply believe in the aspirations of the Hawke Labor Government, the labour movement in general and the program which this Government is pursuing for a fairer and more productive Australia. I was persuaded to match that moral support with action and to attempt the transition from the hurly-burly world of the academy to the quiet, contemplative serenity of political life. </PARA>
<PARA> Private polling and doorstop canvassing soon revealed that that path followed a very simple route. Contrary to some wishful newspaper opinion samples, perhaps one-third of Adelaide voters remained undecided up until this January but most of them had been previously Labor voters. They needed a reassurance that early 1988 was an aberration and we gave them that reassurance in the form of a record on jobs and social reforms to compare with the greatest of Labor's historical legends and a program for the future fully costed and unaccompanied by public relations pap. In Adelaide our two party preferred margin approached 5,000 votes or a 53.7 per cent share, which is essentially a 6 per cent swing back. Our heartland has returned, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I assure you I will reward its faith. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is Adelaide Labor territory? The 1986 census data reveals a population of working people, many renting public housing, with an income level which placed a career grade academic, which I was, in the top 3 per cent of income earners. From the occupational data, about four-fifths of those employed receive wages and salaries and are not professional. These are the people who benefit from Labor Government programs, from Medicare, from national employer financed superannuation, from 1.7 million new jobs, the majority of them for women, from increased child-care places with more to come, improved secondary and tertiary education opportunities for their children and record new pension rate levels. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, of the 107,000 people in the seat, 30,000 were, like me, born overseas and another 20,000 have parents who were born outside Australia-a total of nearly 50 per cent resulting from the recent migration program. I am sure they received the discussions of the `One Australia' concept with great concern. Let me take this opportunity, Mr Deputy Speaker, despite his departure from the chamber, to congratulate the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on this, on his jettisoning of that intolerant position and let me assure him of my support for his determination to eradicate racism from public debate. On that, I think, we can stand as one. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate office, re-established on the Main North Road in Sefton Park shopping complex, will have the capacity to help constituents in six community languages including German, Italian, French, Greek, Chinese and Vietnamese. And who knows; perhaps the burnt snag of the great travelling ALP barbecue may be lost forever to the spring roll, sweet and sour soup and the odd roast goat. We intend to try. As the great Roman poet Terence put it: `I am a human being and reckon nothing human alien to me'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the seat of Adelaide also contains the major cultural, educational and business institutions of South Australia and for all our community to prosper they must be nurtured. For it has been their excellence that has helped form the uniqueness of Adelaide, a uniqueness forged by the radical colonial bourgeoisie of 100 years ago. I do not know where they have gone since, because that is a uniqueness to which we good Labor men and women aspire now to be the true heirs. Business must profit for labour to prosper. The universities must excel for our civilisation to develop, our museums and theatres must entertain and teach. Indeed, for the last two decades I have laboured-if that is the correct verb-in the heart of one of these great institutions, the University of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I was certainly the first member of my family to study at a university. I was probably the first to set foot in one and was possibly the first even to see one. Universities are really great institutions. They foster learning but tend to elitism. They cultivate freedom but are cloistered. They stimulate initiative but often permit conformity. They are far too valuable for us as a civilisation to lose but I am afraid, like the rest of us, they must change. </PARA>
<PARA> I first entered the London School of Economics for a scholarship interview in 1961, a long time ago, and I only relinquished my attachment to a series of universities this year when somewhat in shock I surrendered my office key, but not yet my car park sticker. I have long believed the excellence of the old universities in Australia has been insufficiently accessible to Labor's support base of working class people. Labor's reforms of the last few years I am certain will improve this situation considerably for the benefit of the overwhelmingly working class supporters and voters for Labor that I received in the seat of Adelaide only the month before last. I regret indeed that those reforms excited some hostilities among the academics' union, the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, FAUSA, of which I was last year a branch president. </PARA>
<PARA> When I left the university, my former departmental colleagues kindly dined me at a favourite Vietnamese restaurant. We had the sweet and sour soup and we also had some spring rolls-soft ones. They gave me three books. One was an old radical tract which I co-authored and which will remain unnamed. They had to photostat it, however, because it had been sold out, not remaindered. They also gave me Machiavelli's The Prince-the greatest work on practical politics known to me-and also Cohen's How to Become Prime Minister. I would have to regard that as the best operational guide to Australian politics that I have read, certainly recently. But I have to caution that my career so far peters out at about chapter 8 and for endorsement of the later chapters one would have to inquire on the front bench. </PARA>
<PARA> The dinner was long, liquid and mostly Labor, save for the Tory chairman, a former Marxist, who now refuses to vote Liberal on the grounds that they have never turned the clock back 10 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> My decision to leave the Academy excited surprise, but only there, which gave me occasion to demonstrate my literary as well as classical education:</PARA>
<PARA>There is a tide in the affairs of men,</PARA>
<PARA>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</PARA>
<PARA>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</PARA>
<PARA>Is bound in shallows and in miseries. </PARA>
<PARA>I believed in 1988 that Labor needed to win back Adelaide to hold government. I was partly wrong. Our margin was more secure, save in Victoria. I believed, wholly correctly, that this Government needed more power in order to navigate Australia well into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA> Human affairs are not just about the distributional aspects of national income and expenditure, important as these are and to which I have already alluded. Our nation is but one among 160 and these vary greatly in size, wealth and character. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is distinguished, I believe, most of all by its dedication to democratic government, a dedication which it takes to extremes in the frequency of elections at so many levels. However, I would not propose to change one bit of this. It ensures that when the people speak we all, as representatives, listen. </PARA>
<PARA> But Australia does not exist in a vacuum and in the competitive pecking order of wealth and power which characterises this society of states we have been sliding for one, maybe two, maybe 2 3/4 generations. We cannot afford to continue this process, nor indeed will it be permitted to us by other states. We must change in order to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge for this Labor Government has been and will be to stay true to the Labor tradition of equity while improving our efficiency within the international system. Explaining those aspirations and the policies which spring from them to our Labor voting heartland is our task for the 1990s if we want to survive as a government and as a prosperous nation. That is a task I obviously believe that only Labor can accomplish. It is a task that requires the undivided attention of those of us privileged enough to represent our citizens in this great body. </PARA>
<PARA> Since this task is likely to encompass the greater part of the remainder of my working life, despite efforts to the contrary from other political parties, I intend to devote the rest of my remarks to it in very broad brush. </PARA>
<PARA> I think our first objective must be to increase the proportion of our national income devoted to savings. As is well known and well documented, the savings ratio in Australia has been declining rapidly in the last couple of decades. In the absence of domestically generated savings, investment funds will continue to be imported, thereby worsening our indebtedness. This is not caused by the borrowers, who are merely the manifestation of the basic problem. If savings were, say, 15 per cent GDP and foreign borrowings, say, a further 10 per cent GDP, giving an investment ratio of 25 per cent GDP-a situation which almost obtained a generation ago-I would be less concerned about the matter. But when the figures are more like 5 and 10 per cent the situation is very difficult to sustain. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that our debates about changes to taxation policies, the very dramatic innovatory program of national employer-funded superannuation policies and future Federal-State relations need to be addressed in the context of the need to accumulate domestic savings. As a nation we are spendthrifts. My experience is that this condition applies to all classes and yet all classes are inclined to blame one another. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second task is to direct this increased savings mass, if and when it is achieved, into productive investment other than the family home and broad acres. Achieving this objective has also not been easy, although it is occurring. A generation of tariffs and subsidies together with buoyant terms of trade for primary producers has hampered, and perhaps hampered severely, the development of an entrepreneurial culture for secondary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Reducing infrastructure costs in transport and communications, which is clearly on our agenda over the next three years, lowering the rate of taxes on profits, which has already occurred, award restructuring and a productivity component in wage rates within the accord will clearly assist. But two features presently being canvassed may be unachievable. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has repeatedly and correctly stated, taxpayer funds should not be used to try to `back winners' in the marketplace. Inevitably, some losers would also be selected, with the corresponding consequences for public financial institutions presently being enjoyed in some States beginning with letters late in the alphabet. </PARA>
<PARA> But neither do I believe, on the other hand, that an extensive privatisation program of already publicly owned institutions can be undertaken. Simply put, a massive extension of the market into public utilities is presently unacceptable to the Labor heartland vote. There is no support among the thousands of people who got me elected for selling the Commonwealth Bank and precious little for doing the same thing to Telecom, Australian Airlines or the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. We will have to go another route and I do not believe that that is not possible to find. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the balance of payments deficit needs to be turned around, and probably more quickly than has been occurring over the last year or so. I am not persuaded that the Opposition's essential resolution of this problem, that is, a massive deflation of the economy, would produce the desired result since I see little evidence that a deflation of the economy would produce a corresponding deflation of the import ratio. I also find it hard to believe that a rapid deflation of the economy will increase the incentives for exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to the address by the Leader of the Opposition. I thought many of his criticisms would strike home, particularly as his speech was being broadcast, but I listened in vain for an alternative program to that which was presented by us at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA> I also cannot take the view that the excellent environmental policies developed by this Government over the last three years-this Government has done more for environmental protection than any government in the history of Federation-have contributed significantly to our international indebtedness problems. In any case, I would not dilute any of them. Even if I wanted to, I would be short of a campaign committee at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1980s we spent much time trying to persuade Australian managers to get involved in exporting to the Asia-Pacific region, which was then the most rapidly growing component of the world economy. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition devoted some time to this. Without gainsaying the fact that the Asia-Pacific regional economy is going to grow rapidly, I believe that it will co-dominate the international economy in the 1990s and into the twenty-first century with the North Atlantic. The unification of the European community in 1992, together with the reconstruction of the former Soviet empire, is going to open massive new opportunities. I only hope that we are in a position to seize them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say something about our population policy, which means our immigration policy, since natural domestic reproduction seems to be beyond the control of government policy. Until recently I had been a supporter of a buoyant, non-discriminatory immigration program with a strong skills component to assist national development. I believed that it stimulates economic activity, enriches our national culture and enhances our national market. I still hold these views but note that, if the evidence which is presently being touted to the effect that a large immigration program increases significantly our international indebtedness problem, some revision all round will be required. I have not been persuaded so far of that case but leave my mind open to persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I come immediately from an academic population whose culture fosters the view that its members can speak with authority on just about anything, a view accepted almost nowhere else in the community. In that sense I believe that we resemble lawyers. I note the rapid growth of both professions in our midst on both sides of the House and fear the consequences for the sitting times and the common touch. I trust that you, Mr Speaker, or whoever is sitting in that seat will use your usual and legendary efficiency to deal with the problem. In the meantime I remain as overwhelmed by my elevation to this august body as I was on 24 March and, as a humble working-class boy trying to make his way in the world, I thank honourable members kindly for their very warm reception. </PARA>

<PARA> I acknowledge the presence of my wife and parents in this chamber today and I thank them for so many things that cannot be counted. </PARA>
<PARA> We sit here as a House of Representatives and it is as a representative that I come to this place. I am conscious of the fact that I sit in this House as the representative of the electors-all the electors-of Higgins and I am conscious of the honour they have bestowed upon me. The people of Higgins have been well represented in this chamber in the past. They will be well represented in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This House has, over a long period of time, established a fine tradition of procedure to allow its members to discharge their primary duty of representation. We shall not represent our electors well, however, if we allow the procedures of this House, designed to enhance this representative role, to decay or degenerate. It is of concern to me that in the recent past there has developed a tendency to use the valuable Question Time for long answers and expansive statements. This diminishes the number of questions that can be asked. This practice also diminishes the accountability of the Executive to the electors. There has, unfortunately, also developed a tendency to guillotine debate and to introduce legislation with little or inadequate notice. This too diminishes the function of this House in acting as a check on Executive power, in calling to account ministerial administration, and in scrutinising proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We should take note of the fact that in many countries around the world at this moment people are struggling to set up representative Houses as a check on executive power and we should draw inspiration from them not to let our own traditions decay. Australia has been blessed with fine parliamentary institutions and we are their guardians. If we, the guardians of this great parliamentary institution do not properly discharge our duties we betray our past, we compromise our future and we let down those who have placed their trust in us. In the contest between the Executive and the Parliament, I am for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech setting out the Government's program on the occasion of the opening of this the Thirty-sixth Parliament, His Excellency the Governor-General cited two overriding goals of Government policy: first, the establishment of a stronger, more competitive and environmentally sustainable economy and, secondly, the creation of a fairer and more compassionate society. Today I wish to address myself to each of those goals. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk of creating a fairer and more compassionate society, what do we mean? Over decades arguments have raged over which system of government best creates such a society. Some have argued that a society where government controls industry and controls and directs the production and distribution of goods is a society that is inherently more compassionate and fair. Others have argued the converse. In this century the argument has raged between those who believe that by enhancing government power it, the government, can deliver fairness and compassion to its citizens and others who have maintained that in the interests of fairness the power of government itself must be curtailed and the compassionate resources of our citizens released. </PARA>
<PARA> At its highest point the system of government ownership and government control was practised in the Soviet model. We should never forget that this system was practised and implemented in the name of producing a fair and compassionate society. All through the dark years of failure and repression there were those whose faith never wavered that that system would produce a fair and compassionate society. But now the failure of that model is nakedly exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There could hardly be a person in this House who has not been moved by the valiant rejection of that system in nation after nation over recent years. That system proved a patent failure in delivering compassion and fairness. It was completely discredited by its economic failure. It has been rejected by those who suffered so long and so painfully under it. Recent international events have proved clearly and conclusively that government control, government regulation, government intervention do not necessarily pave the path to a fairer and more compassionate society. Perhaps for the first time this century the argument over this issue is finally ended. It has ended decisively in favour of private ownership, private enterprise, and, above all, in favour of liberal democracy. Some commentators have gone so far as to say that the end of this argument has signalled the end of history. I do not consider that we are now at the end of history, but we have certainly reached the end of the argument. Freedom has won. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the end of this controversy signal the end of controversy in our political debate? Does this mean that politics is no longer about ideas and values? Does this mean that politics shall now be given over to the technocrats? Does this mean that in this House our debate is solely between one set of administrators and another? I think not. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there are still important issues that divide this House-born of different priorities, different goals and ultimately different ideas. I do not underestimate the importance of ideas in political debate. Ideas are our engine room. They set the goals to which our legislation and administration are directed. Our ideas, our goals, are the directional guides in our approach to the day-to-day details of legislation and administration. Without that directional impulse we run the risk of being overwhelmed by immediate detail and urgency, which assumes a life of its own, but leads us nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA> But in making the observation about the importance of ideas, I should sound an important caveat. At the end of the day it is people: parents, children, students, employees, young people and the old-it is the unique individual-that are more important even than ideas. Much misery has been visited on individuals down through the years in the name of an idea or an ideology. We should not forget that people are the end which we serve. Politics is not an end in itself. We are not here to serve ideas. Our task is much greater and infinitely more important than that. </PARA>
<PARA> Our system of government is one of checks and balances. It requires compromise-compromise between the Executive and the Parliament, compromise between one House and another, compromise between the States and the Commonwealth and compromise between groups of persons with legitimate interests and other groups with other legitimate interests. There is room for compromise-indeed demand for it-in a system of checks and balances. Clear goals and ideas will prevent us from the cynical compromise that leads nowhere. The checks and balances prevent us from the excesses that misguided ideas might otherwise lead to. </PARA>
<PARA> So how should we go about our tasks, our goal, of creating a more fair and compassionate society? Shall we set our direction towards giving government and its agencies more money and more power to make people good? Or shall we seek to inspire the compassion of those who comprise our society?</PARA>
<PARA> I regret to say that there has been an unfortunate tendency in Australia over recent years to believe that one's compassion is marked by one's willingness to tax some and give the proceeds, less administration costs, to others. </PARA>
<PARA> We should care deeply enough about those who need compassion to make decisions that really help them, and really help them for the long term. We do not serve people by knee-jerk and automatic responses. There are times when their problems can be alleviated by government spending, but there are many occasions when that is neither a full nor a complete answer. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal causes of poverty in Australia are family breakdown and unemployment. It is family breakdown which leads to youth homelessness. It is family breakdown which leaves supporting parents unable to enter the work force and unable to provide for the nurture of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> We would help the unemployed by securing them real jobs in a productive economy. We would limit the victims of family breakdown by doing what we can to strengthen the family unit. This is why our deliberations and our policies should always be guided towards the goal of preserving the family unit and making our economy productive. This is why it is so important to get our basic economic decision-making right. At the end of the day the fate of Australians depends upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is tempting to stand here and talk about the economy as if it were just a statistic or a series of tables. It is tempting to stand in the luxurious and imposing surrounds of this House and to think that somehow this is the engine of the Australian nation; it is not. The engine room of the Australian nation is found in the shops, the factories, the farms and a whole host of workplaces scattered far and wide across this nation. Some are large but predominantly they are small. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the enterprise and the work of those millions that create the wealth of this nation. These are the people who sought no government commission to trade; they sought no government program to establish their business or job; they asked for no government assistance to maintain it. They do not ask the Government to be a nanny, to scold, to reprove and to smother them with advice. </PARA>
<PARA> What they ask of government is an unobtrusive administration so that they can continue to generate that wealth, continue to provide for their families and continue to pursue their aspirations. In going about their ordinary business, these millions of wealth generators contribute to the well-being of all. So, in the contest between the government and the citizen, I am for the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> His Excellency in his Speech outlined the Government's program on small business. The Government proposes to develop a response to one of the reports of this House. Reports and responses have their place but they are no substitute for action. We do not achieve anything real for small business in this country by responding merely to our own recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problems of small business in this nation are exorbitant interest rates, industrial awards that are wholly inappropriate and the cost burden of attending to the myriad government reporting and regulation requirements which have marginal utility. If we did something-actually did something-about those problems we might help small business. I shall look for deeds, not words, from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing this in mind, I approach with real caution the stated intention of the Government to pursue broad-based structural reform in this term. I will take a great personal interest in monitoring its achievement. I welcome the fact that at least the Government recognises the problem. The goal of structural reform is to produce a more efficient infrastructure that will lead to higher productivity in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Structural reform will undoubtedly mean ending privileges for some, but that is not its goal; its goal is to end those particular privileges which visit burdens on many. Those who lose their privileges may clamour loud and long but we should not be directed by that. Those who receive the benefits are diverse and scattered; their voices consequently muted. But we should not direct our policy according to the sound and the fury; we should direct it according to the real benefits to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Over recent years I have taken a particular interest in labour management and industrial relations. This is a classic case where the sound and fury of organised groups with privileges to defend so easily drown out the voices of those disadvantaged by current arrangements. The voice of those thrown out of work because they refuse to associate with trade unions they disagree with does not sound as a fury but as a small voice-nonetheless a small voice that needs to be heard in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Such also is the voice of employees who have no right to stipulate fully and determine the terms on which they will work. This too is the voice of those who are unable to agree freely with their employees on terms of work for mutual benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The sound and the fury against that small voice raise an important argument for this place. Modern trade unionism has, to some degree, become an argument about monopoly control-the monopoly control of labour by officialdom. The powers and monopolies in our system are so great that some fear to name them. But in the contest between the powerful monopoly and the individual, I am for the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> I count myself fortunate to enter this House at the beginning of a new decade and at the close of an old century. I am perhaps part of a younger generation now entering this House. If we measure our political formation by the great issues that have been debated in this House, I am perhaps a representative of the post-Vietnam war generation. In personal terms, for my generation, unlike the generation 10 years older, Vietnam does not mean conscription; Vietnam means another regime where repressive government has stifled individual liberty and impoverished a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The exodus, at extreme cost, of those who left that country seeking freedom is a reminder of the deep thirst for freedom in the deep reservoir of human nature. It is a reminder of the danger of ideology. It is a reminder of the danger of government excess. It is a reminder that government should be subservient to the citizen; the Executive accountable to the representative parliament; and the monopoly give way in the face of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the broad principles that direct me and I believe these are the principles by which a government's success or failure should be measured. These are measures of a fair and compassionate society. Together they enrich the soul of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I indicate that it is a great pleasure for me to represent the people of Parramatta in the Federal Parliament. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker on their re-election and also to congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on achieving an historic fourth term for our Australian Labor Party Government. I would like to congratulate my colleagues who also have made their maiden speeches today. In particular I congratulate a previous speaker, the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who represents the electorate adjoining mine, and the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), whose address I enjoyed immensely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ministry and the Party organisation at all levels deserve praise for the excellent campaign. There has been an electorate of Parramatta in the Federal Parliament since Federation. It is certainly an honour to become the eleventh member since that time. I am pleased to follow John Brown as the member for Parramatta. John served the Parramatta electorate and Australia well, and his contribution, particularly as a dynamic tourism and sports Minister during the first five years of the Hawke Government, was indeed a great contribution to our nation. I know that John is listening today and I would like to thank him for all the encouragement and assistance that he has given me as his successor. I wish him well in his retirement. I know that he will continue to strive for the growth of our tourist industry in his role as chairman of the tourism task force. John can be justly proud of his achievements in Parliament and Parramatta. </PARA>
<PARA> My thanks also go to my very hardworking and dedicated campaign team. Their dedication and support were critical for my victory which, I am pleased to say, saw our two-party preferred vote improve by over 2 per cent. My campaign director, John Haines, and the campaign team, including my Federal Executive Council and branch members, friends and supporters, did a wonderful job. I especially want to thank my wife, Julie, for her great support and my family, particularly my father, Jack, for his support and influence in shaping much of my political ideals and values. I look forward to being part of the Government which fills the wide range of initiatives outlined in the Governor- General's Speech last Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA> Parramatta is the second oldest European settlement in Australia, having been founded on 2 November 1788 by Governor Arthur Phillip. Today, it is a thriving commercial city and is referred to as Sydney's second commercial business district with one of the fastest growth rates in the country. It is also the home of the Parramatta rugby league team, the Eels, which has brought great distinction to the district over recent years, including last Friday night. Parramatta is the gateway to a population in western Sydney of 1.7 million. Over 35,000 people work in Parramatta each day. It has a major commercial and financial centre, together with a loyal and proud population. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that more people live west of Parramatta today than to the east. People in my electorate often refer to Sydney as our little seaport to the east. This growth, together with Parramatta's strategic importance and the way it has sustained early European colonisation through agricultural produce, is now being repeated in industry and commercial activity which is well recognised by the Government. My electorate has many large and small businesses. I applaud the creation by the Government of the Ministry for Small Business. </PARA>
<PARA> A new Parramatta Commonwealth centre was one of the Hawke Government's earliest decisions, pursued by John Brown. I am pleased to say that the building opened its doors earlier this week to a number of Commonwealth departments. The history of the project contrasts the Labor way with that of our opponents. First proposed by the Whitlam Government prior to its dismissal, it was delayed continually through the Fraser years and finally made a reality by the Hawke Government. The Commonwealth centre will bring services of the government to the people where they live. Likewise, our stadium, riverside theatres and Commonwealth law courts have all been achieved through the Hawke Government recognising the needs of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Such services and provision of quality recreation and employment opportunities have been central to our Government's efforts in the Parramatta region. I have no doubt that the Government's record on the quality of urban life issues was of great importance in our success in the recent election campaign. The campaign run by the Labor Party was always to be relevant and timely to Australia's needs. The clear message and presentation of the issues was a key factor in our success in Parramatta. The Government's record on the protection and preservation of our environment was pivotal to our victory. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of employment has been a major issue in western Sydney, especially in Parramatta. When Labor came to power in 1983, youth unemployment in my electorate was about 18 per cent, and worse in some adjoining areas. Today the figure is closer to 3 per cent. More importantly, the participation rate has risen dramatically. Maintenance of this employment growth is vital for the future of our region and I welcome the references in the Governor-General's Speech to a comprehensive thrust towards sustainable development. Our region has played a pivotal role in the rebuilding of Australia's industry which is so vital to building our export income. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no greater challenge in our region over many decades than redressing the lack of educational equity. This applies at all levels. The school retention rate of those completing secondary school in my electorate has more than doubled under our policies-a great achievement. This growth, together with aspirations for our own university, has been a key political issue in the region. Along with many other political representatives, I worked in a major campaign when I was Mayor of Parramatta to ensure the full development of our own university dream. Thanks to the Hawke Government the dream has become a reality and the university now has its first students. A campus of the university, I am pleased to say, is in my electorate at Westmead. </PARA>
<PARA> The full development of that university will be a key issue that I propose to pursue during the parliamentary term. In my view there is no greater practical demonstration of social justice and social democratic commitment than to give all young people the opportunity to embark on the pursuit of education and ideas. Regrettably, in the past, assumptions were made that the vast majority of young people from our region would not pursue tertiary studies and, thus, the inequity and inequality were extended and perpetuated. However, much remains to be done to fully develop our university as I know the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) will attest following a visit to the university a fortnight ago. I know that the pursuit of educational equity is now high on the Government's agenda and this will herald a new era for our region. I look forward to contributing to debates on education issues in Parliament in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important when looking at equity and social justice and the challenges facing our nation to appreciate the real worth of all the talents we have in this country which are directly related to the pursuit of human resource talents. The University of Western Sydney and the initiatives in developing educational equity for our region are a practical demonstration of my motivation for being a political activist. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a number of other areas of keen interest to myself and many of my constituents. My electorate has a large number of ethnic groups-the Lebanese community is one of the largest-and I share with them a keen desire to ensure a successful negotiated peace to the tragic and destructive conflict in the Lebanon. In the interests of developing a humane and compassionate approach to immigration policies, I trust that the tragedies so many families have experienced will be full appreciated by those developing and applying our immigration regulations. I welcome the amendments proposed yesterday by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) to the appeal provisions under these regulations. The changes will make the legislation fairer and represent a commonsense response to the issue by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of my electorate, which is in the upper reaches of the Parramatta River basin, has a substantial urban flood problem. This has been well recognised by our Government with a $1.4m allocation over the last two Federal Budgets towards eliminating the problem. Much more remains to be done as over 400 homes have been flooded in the district on two occasions over the last few years. I know that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) will continue to give this matter the priority it deserves. Having experienced floods in rural New South Wales in my childhood, I also add my sympathy and admiration for the courage shown by those affected by the devastating floods in the country areas of eastern Australia in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General's Speech and the endeavours of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) highlight the Government's willingness to meet the economic challenges confronting our nation. The necessity to rebuild the Australian economy and to ensure our international competitiveness must be a fundamental priority for our Government. This has been well recognised by the broad labour movement in the great restraint it has shown over the last seven years. In my view it is not a time for some magic formula approach that some in the Opposition proffer, or for the cure-all through a broad-based consumption tax which the Treasurer dealt with today at Question Time. The deception of an unequal sharing of the burden, so often advocated by our opponents, works to the detriment of the needy and all those in the trade union movement in a most unfair way. Our Government has created a real Budget surplus and a boost in aggregate savings will best be achieved by sustained improvement in general economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, priority needs to be given to micro-economic reform in the transport and communications field. I have no doubt that our Government, as the Governor-General's Speech enunciated, will adequately address this issue. As a progressive reform party, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has always been preferred by Australians to tackle vital but difficult reform problems. Micro-economic reform is one of the complex issues which I am sure we have the fortitude to deal with. I appeal to those in the Opposition to address economic and micro-reform issues in an intellectually honest way. </PARA>
<PARA> I can think of no area which produces more waste and duplication than the division of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. The scope for real reform in recognition of the role and importance today of the national government is immense. Regrettably, this whole area is one which the conservatives throughout Australia consistently ignore or resist, as evidenced by their timid, contradictory attitude on national environmental protection powers. I have spent the last 12 years in local government and throughout that time have witnessed the virtue of devolving power to local communities and the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of child-care provision and many employment and training initiatives over that period are examples that have convinced me that many of the functions performed by the States create a duplication and waste which major reform of the Federal-State relationship would eliminate. I advocate a move towards direct block funding of specified local services with limited guidelines without the necessity to establish further State bureaucratic structures. I hope that with time there will be bipartisan support for constitutional reform in this area in the interests of real micro-reform of our intergovernmental relationships. I trust that sustainable steps will be embraced by all those who talk so much about the necessity for micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform is much more than the phoney notion of a sell-off of a few public assets at bargain basement prices, which our opponents advocate. The commitment of the Government to look at creative and innovative reforms in the transport and communications field is very welcome. I look forward to contributing to these issues in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The protection and enhancement of our environment, especially the range of needs of large urban centres, require a policy with vision. In this country we need a dynamic set of comprehensive city policies. Indeed, I can say that it was much of the vision of the Whitlam program that brought me to the Australian Labor Party originally. Much of the agenda and needs in our society are different 20 years on. But I look forward to the Governor-General's Speech and the Prime Minister's policy speech contributing to the development of a dynamic blueprint which ensures that the hopes and aspirations of all the people I represent are capable of fulfilment. </PARA>
<PARA> The special focus we have given to the needs of the aged and to the creation of new child-care places has great significance for the people of my electorate. Together with special help for those involved in the well-being of the homeless and people in real genuine poverty, these are things that the Government is addressing and they highlight our traditional true Labor values.</PARA>
<PARA> I intend to work to ensure that the spirit and national pride evidenced by the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Anzac landing ensure that veterans, particularly the Vietnam veterans, have their needs enhanced by the national parliament and translated into socially just policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to ensure that the full health and welfare needs of all in our community are attended to irrespective of means. This is clearly the virtue of Medicare. However, the effective funding and equipping of our health system also need urgent attention. I reject the notion that the only way to have adequate health care is for everyone to be forced into private health cover and private hospitals. It is one vital area of micro-economic reform of Federal-State relations that I referred to earlier. The Opposition's failure to address the matter is the reason that it went to the last election without a health policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I assert the need for Australia in the 1990s to maintain an outward-looking national perspective despite the economic challenges we have. The real success we strive for is the expanded well-being of the population built on the resource talents of our people. The massive attack on education in New South Wales under the Greiner Liberal Government sold the skills and ideas of people short. Much of the shallow debate about immigration has done the same. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject much of the simplistic and opportunistic debate about immigration. I have no doubt that we can have a meaningful and worthwhile cities program without presuming that immigration intakes are at the core of difficulties in urban planning. I urge that any debate about immigration or its economic benefits not be conducted in a fashion which would allow any opportunistic and divisive racial undercurrents to emerge. The Parramatta community is certainly diverse and multicultural. I have been constantly impressed at citizenship ceremonies by the recipients' desire to work for the well-being of Australia. I have no doubt that historically we have benefited economically and socially from our immigration programs. The Opposition's cynical opportunism over the multifunction polis issue during the recent election campaign does not augur well for an informed immigration debate. I trust that everyone will appreciate the importance of the preservation of the social fabric and cohesion in our society as an international example. We owe that to all of those who live in and are part of the southern Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great honour and privilege to be elected to this House and to follow a number of distinguished Australians who have held this seat. I look forward to serving the people of Parramatta. As the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) pointed out on Tuesday, people in eastern Europe have been prepared to risk individual safety to have the right to democracy. The black majority in South Africa has shown the same determination and courage. I have been proud of our Government's international leadership in these developments. May I say that the Labor Party has always led the way in such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> As one with a consuming interest in Greek philosophy, may I say that none of us in the Parliament should underestimate the worth of democracy. Socrates and Plato, who founded so much of the political process that participatory democracy enjoys today, together with the people of Australia, look to us all to ensure the relevance and vitality of this institution. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in our place in the international setting the opportunity to be a world leader in both democracy and the collective development of our nation. All of us should take that obligation very seriously. We should all value the honour we have been granted to serve in this place, as I certainly do. I look forward to contributing positively to the full range of matters which come before the Parliament. I have no doubt that in the course of the next three years our Government's program will ensure that our whole nation is placed more socially just and, to use my predecessor's words, `fairer and more compassionate' with an enhanced international reputation and an economy well equipped to be a leader in into the next century. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by informing the House of Representatives that this afternoon the Australian Senate censured the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate. I will speak more about this matter further in my address. I congratulate the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) on their maiden speeches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standard of maiden speeches on both sides of the House in the ninetieth year of operation of the Australian Parliament is quite remarkable. I think that it was an outstanding effort by the members involved. I wish the members concerned well in their parliamentary careers. I look forward to getting to know the members more closely. I particularly commend the honourable member for Higgins and the honourable member for Aston for the contributions that I am sure they will make on the floor of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take the opportunity to commend one other maiden speech made in the Australian Senate this time last night by a new and younger senator, Senator Bill O'Chee, a National Party senator from Queensland. He was elected to the Senate by decision of the Queensland Parliament last Tuesday night, 8 May. He came down to Canberra from Brisbane on 9 May. He was sworn in a little later on that day and last night he made one of the most remarkable maiden speeches ever heard in the Australian Senate. Indeed, many senators, even the old guard senators from both sides of the Senate, were very emotional in their support of the maiden speech of Senator Bill O'Chee. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a privilege to hear that particular maiden speech. It shows the mark of a young man-albeit in a hurry-who is deeply intelligent and who will make a very worthwhile contribution to the Australian Senate, to the State of Queensland, and to the Australian nation. I wish him well. I congratulate him on the address. I point out that Senator Bill O'Chee made his maiden speech at the age of 24 years, exactly the age I was when I made my maiden speech in the New South Wales Parliament in 1971 as the then member for Sturt. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to highlight to the House for a moment the background of some of the new members. Contrary to what the honourable member for Higgins might suggest, the Vietnam veteran generation is alive, well and increasing in numbers in the coalition ranks on this side of the House. Indeed, I particularly welcome the new member for McPherson, Mr John Bradford, and the new member for Isaacs, Mr Rodney Atkinson, to the ranks of Vietnam veterans. I think that makes a total of three in the Australian Parliament since the election on 24 March. I hope that there are other veterans on the other side. I have tried to check on that and at this stage am awaiting a final response from the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 June Senator David Hamer retires. He is the last of the World War II veterans to serve in the Australian Parliament. In a sense I think there may be just a couple more returned servicemen in the Australian Parliament in the 1990s. That is a reflection of a number of factors which I will not dwell on at this stage, but I do wish my fellow Vietnam veteran colleagues well in their parliamentary careers. </PARA>
<PARA> I greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak in this Address-in-Reply debate. One of the most important fundamentals of democracy is the need to uphold the rights of the individual. As a member of this House, Leader of the National Party of Australia, and coalition shadow Minister for energy and resources it saddens me to see these rights trampled on by an increasingly arrogant and out of touch government. I say this in the context of the current sitting schedule which crams a large number of very important Bills into a seven-day sitting of the lower House. To date no fewer than 40 Bills have been introduced into the House of Representatives since we commenced sitting last Tuesday, just three days ago. We have a schedule of just seven days to deal with those 40 Bills and push them through to the Senate. It is a sausage machine-type legislative process which is unacceptable, unnecessary, and it is one for which the Government should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, we are scheduled to sit just seven days in the first seven months of this decade. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I and many others say that that is simply not good enough. Members opposite might like to reflect on the role of this House in ensuring the rights of individuals across Australia to have their say through their elected representatives in this chamber. This is nothing less than the operation required of the democratic process. One cannot have it both ways. If one believes in the rights of the individual, then one believes in an active and relevant parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As it will turn out, to deal with 50 Bills in seven days over a seven month period is not just wrong; it is dangerous. We on this side of the House have a vision for Australia which is exciting for those who are optimistic about this nation's future. One can only be optimistic about Australia's future if the necessary prerequisites of less government and less taxation and more productivity and more efficiency come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition and I are as one in our efforts to raise productivity and efficiency especially with infrastructure within this great land. I bring to honourable members' attention the nation's labour productivity performance in this regard. In the business sector our labour productivity stands at a miserable 1.1 per cent annual growth. This compares with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 2.1 per cent and productivity growth of 2.6 per cent which is enjoyed in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I take this opportunity to highlight the economic role of rural and regional Australia-provincial Australia if you like. If one looks at the related figures for labour productivity in our agricultural and mining industries, one finds averages of 5.3 and 6.3 per cent as those industries set a cracking pace notwithstanding enormous difficulties in boosting their productivity, given the inefficiencies of the transport regime and other ramifications impacting on their underlying efficiency. One can see that it is this part of Australia which is the driving force behind our export sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that primary products, including mining, account for some 67 per cent of our exports. These products, which are so necessary to the nation's economic health, are the result of sweat and toil by those in our rural and regional areas. Our great export industries, such as coal, wool, wheat, aluminium and iron ore are the engine room of the country's economic development whether we like it or not. We must be proud of our exporters for their efforts to bring about a better performance and a better standard of living for all Australians. We can be less proud of this nation's massive pattern of consumer spending. </PARA>
<PARA> There must develop within this country an export ethic. I am convinced that such an ethic will be fostered in an environment where there is incentive to work and produce, free from unnecessary government intervention, and where the pre-eminence of private enterprise within the economy is actively encouraged. The current environment for growth and development within our nation is less than satisfactory and the blame for this lies squarely with the Federal Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken about labour productivity and the impressive performance of our primary producers and miners. Notwithstanding that, our primary producers, small business operators and the self- employed generally right across Australia are falling behind in relation to living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the Labor Party's idea of incentive. Despite impressive improvements in productivity these sectors are suffering, especially as they do not enjoy the luxury of such mechanisms as automatic consumer price index (CPI) adjustments. They ride the ups and downs of the market and currently many are experiencing a sharp deterioration in their living standards due to Labor's cruel interest rate regime. This is creating economic agony across Australia, particularly in many parts of provincial Australia. These people do not necessarily complain about their situation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would have hoped that those opposite could see that there is an undesirable irony when one compares the self-employed, the small businesses and the primary producers with less productive elements flowing from the centralised wage fixation process who have either CPI adjusted wages or other mechanisms which ensure the protection of real wage levels. I include in this those at the senior executive level who are often not constrained by anything other than their shareholders' tolerance. Perhaps in that context I should point to the role of the Australian Shareholders Association and its attempts to monitor this area of activity and the need for its resources to be expanded so that there is an informed and confident investor clientele in Australia who are confident that they are getting a fair go as shareholders in relation to their investments which, in turn, help drive the economy along. </PARA>
<PARA> Productivity is required at all levels and it is just as relevant in the boardrooms as it is at the coalface. I appeal to all members of parliament to consider our highly productive primary producers, small business operators and the self-employed sectors when discussing wages policy and industrial relations policy. I am not in the least advocating the inclusion of these sectors in the centralised system, quite the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> I support strongly the coalition's policy approach as outlined by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and others earlier this day. What I am saying is that they are the forgotten stalwarts of this nation. I use this word advisedly for it describes those who are sturdy, courageous, resolute and determined to get on with the job, generate productivity and real income for Australia and so help the standard of living for all Australians and our export effort. This Government takes this sector for granted far too often. This Government taxes this sector out of existence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) who is aptly described as Mr Forty-eight Per Cent following his less than convincing win in Wills. The Prime Minister of this nation was forced to go to preferences in his own seat. We have a Government which can only be described as Mr Thirty-nine Per Cent as its primary vote did not even reach the 40 per cent mark. There is no guarantee of stable government with this Government which is living on a borrowed mandate. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the vote of the Australian Senate today by 37 to 32 to censure Senator Michael Tate, clearly this shows that he is also living on borrowed time. Indeed, the motion carried was:</PARA>
<PARA>That the Senate censure the Minister for Justice for failing to meet the required standards in the conduct of his office as a Senior Law Officer of the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me say two things about that. Can anyone honestly claim that Senator Tate is some babe in the woods with regard to the law and legal practice? The silence is deafening because nobody can. He was a lecturer in law at university level. </PARA>

It is one which should have brought forth his immediate resignation as a Minister of the Crown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can anyone claim that the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs is a babe in the woods with regard to this whole business of drug surveillance? He has a knowledge of the drug operators, their pattern of existence and operations between Thailand and Australia and he has had particular responsibility for such projects as the Australian Thailand Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) computer project. </PARA>
<PARA> According to a document that I have in my hand, on 10 March 1988 the same Minister for Justice, Senator Michael Tate, visited Thailand. He had discussions with the then Deputy Prime Minister, discussions with the Director-General of the Royal Thai Police and discussions with the very personable, confident and capable Secretary-General of the Narcotics Control Board in Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister then went on to inspect the joint Australian Thai computer project, conducted by the Narcotics Control Board. What is the first thing those officials print out when one goes to look at that computer? I am going to tell honourable members. It has not been said publicly before. It is the very best entry that it has on that computer. It prints out a document and gives one a glance from a distance so one will not gain any confidential information. It is a pattern of movement of a particular person well known in the trade and the subject of considerable interest to Australia and Thai officials. Several of these documents will be printed out so that one can see how the ONCB computer carefully tracks the people who move between Australia and Thailand and other countries. It is an excellent project. I strongly support it. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that Senator Michael Tate knows a great deal more about the whole equation than he has admitted. He is no babe in the woods with regard to the law. He is no babe in the woods with regard to drug enforcement and the drug trade between Australia and Thailand. He has a great deal more to answer for, more so since the Australian Senate censured him this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> The House has been told that the Prime Minister will serve his full term between now and the next election and that he will contest the next election. Senator Button told us the truth once again when he said that a deal is in place. He took several days to try to deny it. Worse still, the Government put up a smokescreen. During the campaign the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) was given the official blessing, the official imprimatur, that he would be Deputy Prime Minister. This was so that the Press gallery and the nation would not get frightened by the fact that the real scenario was for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to become Deputy Prime Minister. As soon as the election was over, within 48 hours, the poor old honourable member for Batman was dispatched to the sidelines and on came the Treasurer to become the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. I think the public was misled on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have followed the comments of Senator Walsh with a great deal of interest since the election. It is his view that time is running out for Australia. I fully concur. It is Senator Walsh's view that we only have a few years to address the fundamental economic problems or they will become irredeemable for the best part of a generation. I fully concur. Finally, it is Senator Walsh's opinion that this Government has, as a deliberate policy, suppressed demand to the extent that it has managed to engineer a recession. I fully concur. Indeed, the truth is out, thanks to Senator Walsh. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope that the Government will recognise the seriousness of the economic recession facing so much of Australia at this time and take appropriate action as outlined so reasonably by the Leader of the Opposition in his excellent address to the House this afternoon. I fully support all his comments in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to touch briefly on one key industry with regard to producing balanced developments in Australia and maintaining our exports. I refer to the wool industry. This week the Government has sabotaged by its legislation the normal operational procedures of the wool industry and the working procedures associated with the reserve price scheme and other associated arrangements. That is not good enough. There should have been full and effective consultation between the industry and the Government. Clearly, this minority Government has failed again on behalf of the thousands of woolgrowers across Australia who contribute so much to the standard of living of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> This minority Government is living on borrowed time. We will play an active part in bringing down this minority Government. The next election cannot come soon enough in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As always, I very much enjoyed the contribution of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-certainly during the term of the last Parliament I found him to be one of the saner shadow Ministers-but I must take issue with some of the points he raised during his address. In particular, he was on rather thin ice when he labelled the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) `Mr Forty-Eight per Cent' and took umbrage because the Prime Minister obtained only that amount of the primary vote. Of course, the Leader of the National Party who went into the election-that is, the former member for Richmond-did somewhat more poorly than the Prime Minister when it came to getting the support of his electors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the House had the honour of hearing the maiden speech of the new member for Richmond (Mr Newell) because an extraordinary event occurred: a leader of a major political party in Australia lost his own seat. It is said that 24 hours is a long time in politics, none more so than for the former member for Richmond. He went to bed on 23 March believing he would be the next Deputy Prime Minister of this country; he went to bed on 24 March being a former member of parliament. I suppose it is a lesson for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating tonight the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's speech. The purpose of the Governor-General's address is to outline the Government's program for the next three years. It also affords members of this House an opportunity to outline their own personal program and what they hope to achieve in the term of this Parliament. This is particularly so for new members, and I take this opportunity to congratulate those members who delivered their maiden speeches. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Richmond and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who are representing seats for the Australian Labor Party for the first time-certainly the honourable member for Richmond is-that when I won the seat of Fisher in 1987 I was also the first Labor member to hold that seat. I tell them not to be discouraged or goaded by the allegations of `oncer' they may hear from Opposition benches. I am very confident after hearing their contributions today-particularly that of the honourable member for Richmond-that they will be long-standing members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I also spoke in the Address-in-Reply after my election to this Parliament in 1987 and, on that occasion, touched on a few matters I thought would be extremely important in the following three years. The first one concerned the need to improve and clean up the Government of Queensland. The second was my hope for a constructive and informed debate about constitutional reform in this country and my hope that the committee-which was at that stage led by Sir Maurice Byers-which was reviewing the Australian Constitution, would come forth with recommendations which would hopefully lead the Australian community through a pro- cess of constructive reform of our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The first objective was completed through the Fitzgerald process, the election of a Labor Government in Queensland on 2 December last year and, now, the prosecution of those corrupt elements in public life, the police force and elsewhere, through the courts of Queensland. That is a very good thing and I was extremely pleased and delighted, as a member of this House, to see that transformation occur in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the issue of constitutional reform met with much less success. The constitutional debate in 1988 was quite fruitless. It developed into nothing but a political point-scoring exercise between the Government and the Opposition. I say in defence that it was largely brought about by the Opposition because a good number of those proposals were, in fact, Opposition policies and yet, for political expediency, the Opposition decided to oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless, the question of constitutional reform remains vital. Indeed, I find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with the comments of the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) who pointed to the odd fact that we hear a great deal about these questions of micro-economic reform, the need to clean up the act of government enterprises, get the wharves operating and fix up the transport and communication systems in this country, and yet we hear nothing about the most fundamental area of governing and regulation, and that is government itself-the system of government in this country, the three tiers of government and the federal system incorporated under the Constitution. We have had no serious debate about whether that system is the most efficient which Australia should have. We have had no debate about whether the aspirations of the Australian people are effectively served by our current system of government and the Constitution which governs it. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely we have come to the stage that we are sick and tired of the rivalries between the Commonwealth and the States? It is debilitating that a country which is facing very serious problems should have to put up with this inanity of conflicts of powers, States' rights and parochial arguments every time there is a new initiative in an area of shared power between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of this was the attempt to establish an Australian securities commission. Premiers, Attorneys-General, the Commonwealth and the States are fighting tooth and nail over the establishment of this commission and the idea of getting a uniform system of company law in this country, and the watchdog to look over it, so that it would be applicable to Australia facing the 1990s. We must look a laughing-stock in the eyes of the world when we act as six separate nations in an area which is so fundamental to our economic well-being as the operation of Australia's corporate sector. </PARA>
<PARA> That is just one example-the most recent one. The common one is the conflict over the environment, which is well-known. Every time there is an idea of getting uniform licensing requirements for transport, we never seem to be able to get agreement between the various levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely this fundamental division, this distribution of power between governments in Australia and the means of resolving conflict between governments, is one of vital importance. It must rank equally with these other issues of micro-economic reform. Surely, in many ways, it is vastly more important than those, in a sense, transient issues which occupy so much time and debate in this House?</PARA>
<PARA> Soon this House will be electing its standing committees to operate throughout the term of this Parliament. I am a strong believer in and supporter of the committee system, and I look forward to that event. I am pleased to be able to announce that I will be nominated by Government members to be the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. If I am elected as Chairman of the Committee it will, indeed, be a great honour and one which I will look forward to. I believe this Committee is one of the most important which the House has. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last term the Committee, under the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths) and his deputy the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) produced a number of extremely important reports, particularly in the field of corporate law. The reports were on mergers, take-overs, monopolies, profiting from competition, fair shares for all and insider trading in Australia, which were two parts of the trilogy which the Committee was inquiring into. The third instalment of that trilogy, corporate practices and the rights of shareholders, was commenced late in the term of the Parliament and not a great deal of substantial pro- gress was made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my hope and intention to have this reference concerning corporate powers resubmitted by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and the Committee take up that reference. I also hope that the Committee could move swiftly in terms of pursuing that particular reference, commencing public hearings in July and having a report ready by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference which I am referring to is to report and to examine the adequacy of existing legislative and administrative controls over a number of matters including market manipulation; warehousing; management buy-outs; disclosure requirements of directors; the relationship between shareholders, management and their companies and the protection of shareholders, particularly minority shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> To an extent these issues were canvassed by the House's sister Senate committee in its report on social and fiduciary duties and the obligations of company directors. That report came down in November 1989. Further, these issues were considered in part in a discussion paper put out by the Companies and Securities Law Review Committee in April 1989. The recommendations of the Senate committee are a very worthwhile starting point for the House committee but, in the words of John Story, in his address to the third conference of business lawyers in March this year, the Senate recommendations represent no more than a mere tinkering with the system. There is growing community disquiet about the actions of some of this nation's most prominent corporate citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was canvassing the outstanding term of reference before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that reference dealing with corporate practices and the rights of shareholders, particularly minority shareholders. I was making the point that unfortunately there is very much a growing community disquiet about the actions of some of our high flying and best known corporate citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This week we have heard quite an amount of people giving their own explanations as to why there is a degree of cynicism in the Australian community. I would suggest that a lot of the reasons advanced certainly do have more than a grain of truth to them. But I think another reason is that the broader population has been told over a good number of years now that they had to pull in their belts and accept restrained wages and they could look forward to very tight living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> While that message was coming forward we had, on behalf of some of our best known corporate citizens, the full example of the greed-is-good Wall Street philosophy. While this same group of people were telling their work force that they could not expect a raise in their living standards, they themselves were engaging in what at the best could be described as very questionable practices, which were leading to accumulations of great empires of wealth in the hands of a few individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent example of that particular experience which I believe is leading to a great deal of cynicism amongst the Australian population was revealed on the Four Corners program on Monday night dealing with the rise and the current difficulties of Mr Elliott. While it would be quite improper of me to go into the details of that case, what it does show is that there is a broader set of problems which are demonstrated by some of the examples we were given by that particular program. </PARA>
<PARA> The program was reasonably superficial in its treatment of the broader company law issues involved. Nonetheless, it brought forward the exact sort of issues which are currently before, or I hope will be before, the legal and constitutional affairs committee. If the reference is re-offered and taken up by the committee, it will be examining the common law and company code responsibilities and duties which are owed by directors to their companies and, more particularly, to their shareholders. Without in any way pre-empting the deliberations of the committee, it appears clear that some of the more important issues which need to be discussed concern the concept of duty of care. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the common law and section 229 of the Companies Code, which really does not expand the common law to any great extent, outline a dual subjective and objective test in relation to directors' duty of care. It is subjective in the sense that the individual's skill and knowledge of the director must be viewed and then the actions of a person with that skill and knowledge are judged on the basis of whether those actions were reasonable in a given set of circumstances. That has been the common law position over a long period of time and the code did not change that, at least not in as much as the code has been interpreted by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate committee had a look at this particular question of the duty of care owed by directors and it recommended a change to the law which bought in a general objective test to be applied in all circumstances. Unfortunately, I can see some difficulties with it. It is certainly not fair that the standard expected of a director of a small proprietary company can be judged the same as the director of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd or one of our larger public companies. Maybe what the Senate committee should have done is take a little more regard of the work that has been done in the United States on this very subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The American law institute has produced a draft code in terms of the regulation of company law in that country. In that code, it puts forward a test which enables a bit of both worlds-that is, a reasonable person test to be broadly applied, but with the safeguard that all the circumstances of the case must be looked at, that is, the circumstances of the particular company and the field or operation which it is in. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is safe to say that as Australia moves into the 1990s, as we have gone through a process of deregulation in our economy and we are relying so much on the performance of our corporate sector, it is not good enough that we can expect to find the retired admirals of the world with little or no expertise or knowledge under the existing law on boards of companies. They really have no duty of care whatsoever because it is absolutely unenforceable in terms of proving that director in that situation has breached the duty. I think that will be a major concern which the committee will have to look at. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of work done on it both here, through the Law Reform Commission and the Senate committee, but more particularly in the United States. There is a body of material there which the committee can start with to review this important area. Side by side with that question is the broader question of the judiciary duties of directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Like all these questions, in principle it is reasonably easy to state what company directors should be doing and what they should not be doing. But actually putting that into practice can be a more difficult operation. You cannot burden a company director with complying with all sorts of tests when they have to make commercial decisions. They often have to make them very quickly, and they have to make them on the basis of the information on hand. </PARA>
<PARA> By the same token, we cannot have the sort of situation where we have seen individuals in this country over recent years buy up and build up personal fortunes. I would not say they did this through loopholes in the law but they certainly did it by applying the law to its letter rather than its spirit. Those same people were able to survive, if you like, the scrutiny of the obvious conflict of interest. How a director can be involved in the purchase of great masses of his own company's shares and avoid a conflict of interest situation I think is very difficult to comprehend. Yet we have seen that example occur on a number of occasions. A lot of it has fallen flat following the stock market crash of 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The examples given on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program may now no longer occur due to the changes in the listing rules, which may now make the acquisition of shares in those circumstances prior to the changing of those rules impossible. Nonetheless, it is a very serious question, because we are looking at very large companies. They have huge budgets. They are employing tens of thousands of people. They are the chief weapons we have in this country in terms of our fight back to earn export dollars, to trade our way out, and I do not think that as a community we can allow people to play with that, to build up personal fortunes, while at the same time putting at risk those companies that are so vital to our community. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are some of the issues, both in terms of the duty of care and the fiduciary duties owed by directors, that we must be able to canvass under the committee's report. I look forward to this term of the Parliament. I will be very greatly honoured if I am elected Chairman of the legal and constitutional affairs committee. We have many important references to continue, including the one I have outlined, the one on the status of women, and tying up the report on the application of Australian laws in our external territories. They are important areas and I look forward to working with members, my colleagues from the Government side, and members of the Opposition to put in place the recommendations which will reform the law for the betterment of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker and fellow members of the House of Representatives, I would like to express my appreciation to the constituents of Maranoa. They have selected me for this great honour and opportunity to represent them in this Parliament. I look forward to being part of the Thirty-sixth Parliament of Australia and to speaking out on those issues that I consider fundamental and for which I feel a responsibility so to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like my immediate predecessors, Ian Cameron and Jim Corbett, the electorate of Maranoa is `home' to me. I wish to acknowledge the contribution of 10 years' service to this Parliament by Ian Cameron on behalf of the electors of Maranoa. He served on many committees and conference delegations throughout his parliamentary career. I would also like to place on record my appreciation for the support and advice given to me by Mr Jim Corbett and his wife, Ethel, who retain a strong interest in the affairs of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast rural electorate of Maranoa covers almost one-third of Queensland, over 625,000 square kilometres, with a population of 113,000 people and more than 71,000 electors. It encompasses farming centres like Dalby, the rich grazing areas in the Roma, Cunnamulla and Charleville districts and also includes the irrigation and farming centres of Emerald, St George and Cecil Plains. It also has the Moonie and Jackson oil fields and the mining town of Blackwater. </PARA>
<PARA> The nine Queensland State electorates of Roma, Carnarvon, Warrego, Balonne, Condamine, Gregory, Cunningham, Peak Downs and Auburn partially or wholly make up the Federal electorate of Maranoa. Having just lived through a summer of daylight saving in Queensland, it is interesting to note that the sun takes a full half hour to cross the electorate of Maranoa. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time I am reminded of the great Australians who have served in the various parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia; people of vision, incentive and enthusiasm; men such as Menzies, Page, Anthony and indeed Billy Hughes who, it might interest members of this House to know, worked for my grandfather many years ago at the Romavilla vineyards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with certainty that I say that men such as those I have mentioned were men of action and conscience. They were the men who did not allow politics to dictate their natural feelings of justice for all Australians. A natural disaster such as the one that has struck a large part of my electorate would have galvanised them into action. Places like Charleville, Cunnamulla and all those small settlements that rarely rate a mention in the media need help now and would have received it from former governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The men, women and children who have been affected by this natural disaster are Australians and should be treated as such. They do not command the balance of power in this Parliament. They play a vital role in providing services to a vast area of inland Australia. They have a sole parliamentary representative to put their interests and concerns to this Government. I have been given that task and I shall not let them down. I am appealing to all Australian political parties, not just to pay lip service in their acknowledgment of the disaster but to be prepared to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me no joy to have to highlight human tragedy and suffering in my maiden speech. It is now more than two weeks since the devastating floods and it is the general public rather than the Government who are showing their support. Indeed, as I arrived at the entrance to the House on Monday, I saw evidence of the wonderful public support being offered. The parliamentary security, social and sports clubs organised a raffle to aid the flood victims of Nyngan and Charleville which raised $3,000. Tonight the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I drew that raffle and the proceeds are being forwarded tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> The damage really has to be seen to be believed. These flood victims have no houses, no businesses and no jobs. In Charleville alone, in excess of 1,000 houses have been flooded. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy estimates stock losses in the Charleville and Cunnamulla area alone to be in the order of 300,000 sheep, 11,000 head of cattle, 9,000 kilometres of fencing and $6m worth of dams and plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The pioneers opened up this land with the assistance of different governments and this nation has prospered through drought and flood. We must not lose sight of the long term well-being of this country. Let us remember Darwin in 1974. The Government and ordinary Australians committed themselves to the re- establishment of Darwin. There was no posturing. There was action. The result of that action is readily apparent today in our most northern city. </PARA>
<PARA> People must be encouraged to live in our more isolated areas. They must be assisted with education, tax incentives, transport, communications and all those other benefits that urban Australians take for granted. Let us not be fooled into thinking that the heart of Australia can be ignored. Our future-this country's future-will depend on the development and utilisation of all our land. We must keep it alive and well. This means commitment by the people of Australia, through the Australian Government, to provide that support. What it means in plain language is money. I am not talking about low interest loans. I am not talking about public appeals for money. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government represents all Australians. It is time it forgot about technicalities and precedents. It is time it forgot about votes. To quote the battle cry well remembered on the other side of the House, it is time. What those people need is for a strong Prime Minister to say, `What needs to be done will be done'. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for the victims of the floods is vital. Grants to small businesses in those areas should be mandatory. Failure to make grants available will mean the total collapse of many businesses in the region and the subsequent loss of jobs for their employees and the economic ruin of the towns. Continuing employment is essential. The only way that this can be achieved is for the small business men and the small business women of these centres to be given the wherewithal to start again because, believe me, they have the heart to start again. But they need that money. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Charleville last week on both Monday and Thursday. It was very noticeable that by Thursday there were signs of a breakdown in morale. Despair was starting to take hold and tensions were beginning to run high. When people had the flood to fight they showed courage and determination. They got on with the job and did what had to be done. The emergency services responded magnificently and immediately to the call for help and must be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA> However, during the floods some deficiencies were identified in the equipment used in natural disasters. One such deficiency was the absence of the Chinook helicopters, with their great capacity to lift large and heavy loads. This put rescue operations at a distinct disadvantage. If our mothballed Chinooks are sold the proceeds will in no way assist our balance of trade figures. I believe that we cannot put a price on human suffering and the loss of livestock. From a natural disaster and strategic defence position, a limited number of these Chinooks must be put back in service. That should be a decision that is taken in the nation's best interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem now in western Maranoa is a lack of resources to rebuild and an uncertainty about the future. These Australians must be assured immediately that the country is behind them not only in spirit but also in a substantive fashion so that they can look forward, with hope, to the future. The need for help is too important to have to wait for the various State governments to put in action the different mechanisms that allow the Commonwealth Government to act. We must be forward-thinking and place ourselves in a position where support in all forms is swift and non-discriminatory. </PARA>
<PARA> When the re-establishment of these communities has taken place, it is time for us, the politicians, to look to the future and put in place a national natural disaster relief policy. This should be in the form of a national insurance scheme. I would propose a scheme whereby this Government would legislate to ensure that all insurance companies across Australia impose a levy for flooding. Clearly, the bitter lesson from the recent natural flood disaster supports this proposal. The cost to domestic policyholders is estimated at only $5 to $10 extra per annum on a standard householder's policy. Flood insurance for business houses would require a sliding scale depending on the value of the business. All Australian insurance policies would have standard risk cover. Flood insurance would be part of the policy, not optional. I envisage a scheme similar to the comprehensive car insurance scheme. The Federal arena is the only forum in which this type of action can take place. </PARA>
<PARA> This flood will have an adverse effect on our export income and will have ramifications for Australia for some time yet. I think it is pertinent to remind honourable members that in excess of 66 per cent of our export revenue comes from two industries-namely, primary industry and the mining industry. The wealth generated by these resources gives all Australians a better standard of living. We have become far too dependent on imports for our basic requirements, such as refrigerators, washing machines-in fact, most electrical items-as well as many of our motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Without the income from our previously mentioned resources, we would not be able to afford the domestic basics of our everyday life and our standard of living would decline. The Federal Government spent $132m in 1989-90 on export development grants. I think that is a good thing. It is an investment in Australia's future. I put it to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that a similar amount made as a grant to those areas in my electorate which have been devastated would be a good investment too. If this Government fails to make these grants, history will record 21 April 1990 as the day Charleville became Australia's Pompeii. </PARA>
<PARA> The electorate of Maranoa produces a wide range of export products which greatly benefit Australia's economy. Cotton, wool, beef and sheep meats, grain and coal are all produced in the electorate. It is a region which produces much of Australia's oil and gas requirements. Whilst Australia is recognised as a most effective producer of primary products, we must ensure as a nation that we give investors in rural communities every encouragement to further process these vital products. </PARA>
<PARA> What we must address urgently is inland development and further downstream processing of our export commodities. If we fail to do this we are guilty of mining our resources rather than cultivating them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members an example of how our resources are mined. The Jackson oilfield in the Cooper Creek Basin produces in excess of $265m worth of oil and gas annually and pays approximately $11m excise on that production. How much fuel tax is spent by the Federal Government where the wealth is generated? I suggest that not one dollar is returned to roads in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> A priority of this Government must be to ensure that part of the revenue from this resource is put back into the region annually. It must be spent on the development of the great inland road link between Darwin and the Murray-Riverland area. It would be a tourist route. The road would give faster access to the Asian markets via the port of Darwin. Further, it would act as a service road for the Jackson oilfields. This principle must flow on to other inland regions and we must ensure that money is put back into the businesses that generate much of the nation's wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Decentralisation of our population is a must if we are to continue to have a productive rurally based economy. We cannot hide from the fact that our economy is based on rural and mining exports. Rather, Australians should be proud of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The expansion of Australia's long term economic future lies in the successful establishment of joint venture projects which can further process products from mining and agriculture. With the social and political changes now taking place in Asia and the Eastern bloc countries, such projects are a must. These are countries with huge populations and they will demand higher standards of living as the changes take place. We need to ensure that we give incentives to investors who are willing to invest in further downstream processing of our many exports. At the moment far too many leave the shores of Australia in a raw state. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an urgent need for joint venture projects to be encouraged between these nations to process many of our raw products. Two such products grown extensively in Maranoa are cotton and wool. Both have the potential to have further processing carried out in Australia. Further, we must encourage this processing to be carried out in the inland through inland regional development incentives. This would help to decentralise our population. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall a most cynical exercise in the expenditure of public funds. Remember the advertising campaign `buy Australian-made'? Members of the community were positive in their approach to support that campaign, but what happened? We did not have the Australian-made products they demanded. Many of our essential items for life in Australia can be purchased only if we buy from overseas. We must accept that we are living on a line of credit well beyond our means, which cannot go on forever. Honourable members may think that, as a new member, I am being idealistic. Maybe so, but it does not hurt to have goals. We in this Parliament must encourage people to work harder and be more productive, and the best way this can be achieved is through a taxation system which does not discriminate against those people willing to work longer. They must be able to keep that remuneration for their own use. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of this country have to be given hope as hope is the great motivator. I see the function of this Government as providing an economic climate and the type of society in which individuals can decide the direction, the quality and the purpose of their own lives. We need to look at Australia's future with more determination and maturity. Australia is only a very small part in what is now a global economy where only the efficient and productive countries will prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has the responsibility to put in place legislation which not only deals with today's issues but also has a beneficial effect on our children's future. Todays children are tomorrows adults. Their future rests with today's decision-makers. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish by thanking my family. I make a special mention of my mother, who is in the Speaker's Gallery tonight. I thank her, along with my children and my wife, for their support, without which I would not be here today. I thank honourable members for listening in silence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I congratulate you upon your appointment. I also record my congratulations of the Speaker on his appointment to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by my predecessor, Mr Manfred Cross. He served in this Parliament for 24 years with distinction. Over that long parliamentary career he provided outstanding service to the people of Brisbane and the people of Australia, serving on many committees of the Parliament and acting as Chairperson of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that honourable members on both sides of the House join with me in wishing Manfred and Barbara Cross continued good health and satisfaction in their retirement from this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members-Hear, hear!</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very great honour for me to serve in this Parliament representing the people of Brisbane. I thank the people of Brisbane for the confidence that they have displayed in me and for their continued support of the Australian Labor Party which, I am pleased to say, has represented the people of Brisbane in this Parliament for 65 of the last 87 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept the burden of responsibility placed upon me as their representative and I am keen to ensure that the interests of the people of Brisbane are fully appreciated in the Government and in the Parliament. I wish especially to thank the many hundreds of members and supporters of the Labor Party in the Brisbane electorate who, in recent months, worked tirelessly to ensure that Brisbane remained an important part of our Federal Labor Government. As always, Labor Party members provided the strength and energy which have enabled our great Party to achieve many victories throughout its history. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt that I would be here were it not for the dedication of my father to the trade union movement, the Australian Labor Party and the workers of this country. At an early age I learned the values of justice, civil liberties and human rights. I saw first hand some of the injustices which an overly exploitative system can produce. I remain indebted to him for these things. I also remain indebted to my mother who, above all else, instilled a sense of integrity and honesty in me. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, though, I acknowledge the contribution and sacrifices made by my family-my wife, Cathy, who I am pleased to say is in the Gallery this evening, and our three children, Shane, Emma and Daniel. The demands upon them in the last 12 months have been substantial and no doubt they will be in the years ahead. As every honourable member in this House knows, spouses and family pay a price for our work in this place. I thank them sincerely for their support and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> In many respects the interests of the people of Brisbane are the same as those of the majority of Australians in cities throughout the nation. Although I remind the House, in the context of recent sporting events, that the electorate of Brisbane is home to the mighty Brisbane Broncos, a fact that will no doubt be recalled as the season progresses. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the people of Brisbane are concerned for the proper management of our economy. They are concerned with the quality of life for themselves and their children. They are concerned about the need to maintain a quality education system that meets the needs of both the young and those seeking re-entry into education or retraining. They are concerned with the need to maintain a high quality health system open to all Australians and, of course, they are concerned with the sound management and preservation of our environment to ensure that the world we borrow from our children is given to them in good care. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish in my maiden speech to refer to some of these areas which the people of Brisbane regard as important and which I, as their representative in this House, will pursue on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> The world in which we live has become increasingly complex. The pace of change in all facets of social, political and economic life has increased dramatically in the twentieth century and that increase has accelerated since the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes have had an impact upon every fabric of our society, the way in which we conduct our daily lives, the way in which we receive our information and the aspirations which we have as individuals and as a group. They have made the task of government in a modern world more difficult and more challenging than was the case in years gone by. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to the Government's great credit that in these times of change and increasing difficulties it has been able to maintain a social welfare program, a record of economic activity and employment growth of which we can rightly be proud. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, it has set about restructuring Australia's industry and work practices in a manner never before attempted by government in this country. This record stands in stark contrast to the complacency, lack of leadership and ineptitude exhibited by successive conservative governments. For decades conservative governments sat back and adopted a policy of reliance on primary produce exports and mining as the sole basis of Australia's wealth. They mastered the politics of complacency. Little effort was made to establish or assist the development of new industries or to encourage the expansion and modernisation of existing industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, while Australia adopted the `It's all right Jack' approach to economic development, the rest of the world took advantage of the advances that were occurring in science and technology throughout the 1950s and the 1960s and established strong and viable industries in burgeoning areas. Australians are now paying the price for years of neglect by conservative governments. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has confronted those hard decisions and set a course for ensuring that as we move towards the twenty-first century we do so with new and stronger industries, capable of meeting the demands of an ever increasingly active South East Asia-Pacific Rim and able to compete on world markets on the basis of quality and performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst much work has already been done on the reforms needed in our economy, a substantial amount is still to be done. One of the key areas which will be pivotal in ensuring a strong and competitive Australia is industrial relations. It is sad to note that at a time when enormous strides have been taken in industrial relations, with changes occurring in workplace practices, with award restructuring and with second-tier negotiations of recent years, the conservative parties in Australian politics have opted for a course of confrontation, for a return to the simplistic and basic right wing fundamentalist views characterised by groups such as the H. R. Nicholls Society. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian trade union movement deserves acknowledgment for the contribution which it has made to efforts to modernise and restructure our economy in a manner which is both effective and socially responsible. Tripartite industry negotiations and direct negotiations between unions and employers on an industry basis have already seen improvements occurring in a number of sectors in our economy. I have no doubt that the genuine commitment held by union leaders and their members to the creation of a more equitable economy will see this trend increase in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions has provided the stability and the basis upon which many other reforms have been undertaken. It reflects not only a joint understanding of the problems that confront our nation but also a commitment to work for answers to those problems in a manner which those opposite have failed to grasp. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to have been a senior officer of the Queensland Teachers Union and to have been involved in some of the discussions and negotiations which formed part of the trade union movement's attitude towards these issues and, of course, the subsequent negotiations with employers. </PARA>
<PARA> The processes involved are not perfect; they can never be in matters of this sort. However, I am heartened by the commitment demonstrated by both the Government and the trade union movement and am confident that their joint efforts to revitalise our Australian industry will succeed in spite of the prophecies of doom from some honourable members opposite and in spite of the troglodytes, some of whom are still in positions of authority in our business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Management needs to recognise the importance of these changes which are occurring and the need to adopt management and personnel systems that acknowledge and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the accord. During the election campaign the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, visited a brickworks in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). The chairman of the board of that company, Mr John Peile, expressed some personal views about the way in which business and industrial relations are applied at the shop floor level. </PARA>
<PARA> His comments are all the more important when it is realised that he previously had held senior positions as general manager and managing director of large Australian corporations in the top 100 companies in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years ago that brickworks was inefficient and unprofitable. Mr Peile said that the proprietor's contribution since that time had been to provide capital to upgrade manufacturing facilities, which also contributed to the adverse balance of payments, as some of that equipment necessarily came from overseas. The employees' contribution was to freely volunteer valued advice from their experience in the industry and their particular knowledge of the raw materials, and their ready cooperation and willingness to change established practices. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this partnership is a modern works with an efficient labour force, competitive with major manufacturers. That brickworks has already exported its first supply to Japan. Mr Peile said:</PARA>
<PARA>This achievement has been facilitated by the changes of attitude of both employees and employers under the Accord established by Bob Hawke and the Labor Party and I remain apprehensive that if the conservative coalition is elected in the forthcoming election this productive atmosphere will be destroyed as they attempt to deregulate the labour force and lay all the blame for lack of productivity on to the labour force. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>My experience as a manager in many diverse industries over 30 years has been that the major reasons for companies being uncompetitive has been inefficient management, not inefficient labour. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peile continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The much maligned Australian worker is the equal of any in the world, unfortunately the same cannot be said of our managers. In the troubled Fraser years I have seen middle and top management actually provoke strikes so that their own poor management is hidden as they blame lost productivity for their own dismal performance. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last five years, average weekly earnings of workers in that brick factory were increased by 35 per cent. Yet, because of investment in modern equipment and the use of effective management and personnel practices, the cost per metre of the final product is now less than it was five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that entrepreneurial skill and managerial talent that the Australian corporate sector needs to adopt. It needs to stop complaining and start consulting. I am happy to acknowledge that most employers and managers, unlike the Opposition parties, have recognised this need for change and are taking steps to ensure that the opportunities presented by the accord flow through to their business and, in turn, to the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, my background is as a senior officer of the Queensland Teachers Union. Before that I had the pleasure of teaching in Queensland state schools. Of course, education is one of the major areas of government responsibility. It would, therefore, be remiss of me not to comment upon some aspects of education which are important to the people of Brisbane and to our nation. Central to our economic recovery is our ability to be creative and innovative. Education and training have a vital role to play in ensuring that the people of Australia have the intellectual and manual skills our nation requires. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's record in education is outstanding with dramatic increases in tertiary places and increases in the retention rate of students staying to the completion of year 12. Figures tell only part of the story. It is important that there are increased tertiary places and it is important that more of our young people are completing secondary education. However, it is just as important to ensure that the type of curriculum, the resources available, the qualifications of teachers and the opportunities presented at school and in the broader school community satisfy the needs and aspirations of our young people and those receiving education and training and meet the current and long-term needs of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context we must be careful to ensure that education is not seen solely as a training ground for employment. The expansion of knowledge and the rate of change confronting Australia are such that today's knowledge is quickly superseded. Skills learnt in using current technologies are quickly redundant. My wife, Cathy, and I have three young children aged six, nine and eleven. Assuming that all attend some form of tertiary education, they will enter the work force in the twenty-first century. It is not that long ago that we were watching movies about science fiction events occurring in the twenty-first century; yet, that is the era in which my children will enter the work force. The challenge for education for my children and their generation is to teach how to think, not what to think. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance given to the debate on our economic future and the need for restructure can sometimes overshadow other areas which are important to the quality of life of Australia's citizens. The provision of quality health care for all Australians, irrespective of their income, and the availability of social security benefits for those in need are two clear examples. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I believe that it is beyond dispute that the state of our natural environment is at least as important as these factors in determining our long term quality of life and, for many, our day to day quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Were it not for the action taken by this Government, many of Australia's unique natural areas would today have been logged, dammed or in other ways destroyed. As a Queenslander I am very pleased to record that amongst the list of our natural wonders which this Government has preserved through World Heritage listings are the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics of Queensland. This Government has done more than any before it to protect our environment and to embark upon a program of sustainable growth which will ensure that the beauty and uniqueness of our great nation are available for future generations to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that as a Queenslander, 1990 heralds a new era with respect to environmentally responsible government. Queensland, like no other state in the Commonwealth, has suffered at the hands of conservative governments which have paid scant regard to the importance of maintaining our unique environment. I am very pleased that my good friend and colleague the Hon. Pat Comben, Minister for the Environment in the Queensland Government, has been entrusted with the important responsibility of correcting many of the errors left by a careless and inconsiderate National Party Government. The future of Queensland's beautiful and unique surroundings could not have been put in better hands. </PARA>
<PARA> As with all other areas of government activity, the historic election of the Goss Labor Government on 2 December 1989 heralded a new era for generations of Queenslanders who have experienced only National Party, Liberal and Country Party governments. For the first time in more than 30 years the people of Brisbane and Queensland will enjoy the benefits of both State and Federal Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has a responsibility not only to work with State governments in this area but also to provide a lead for the States to follow. The initiatives taken by the Australian Government in preserving important areas of our nation are just a part of that process. It is pleasing to note that the current Australian Government has led the world in protection of the Antarctic and in seeking to eliminate drift net fishing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980s and 1990s the arguments about conservation are about change, not the maintenance of the status quo. Conservative politicians in Australia have traditionally had difficulty coming to grips with conservation and its demands for change, not to mention the ideological problems that those opposite have when discussions of States rights enter the debate. It is no accident that it is only the Australian Labor Party in this place, with its progressive policies and dynamic approach to social and economic change, which has been able to address constructively the concerns of the Australian people and set in place programs which provide for sustainable growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenges confronting our country are many. I know that as a nation we possess the ability, the courage and the determination to meet those challenges. I also know that this Government possesses the strength, the leadership and the vision to focus our nation's talent upon the demands ahead of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) put it well in his policy speech on 8 March this year when he quite rightly pointed out that we can no longer be content to be the lucky country. Australia must become the clever country. Of course, that does not just refer to the establishment of 50 world-class cooperative research centres which this Government will establish over the next five years, impressive though that is. It includes the programs for economic reform, job restructuring, industry restructuring and the provision of all those services to which I have referred and will continue to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am honoured to represent the electors of Brisbane in the Parliament of Australia. I am pleased to serve in a record fourth term Labor Government and I look forward to a career as a member of a Labor Government in this place for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be here as the fourteenth member for Bendigo, an electorate with great historical and political significance. I have the rare privilege of making a second maiden speech. My first was made in 1976 in the Legislative Council of the Victorian Parliament, representing the province of Bendigo, a province which I had the honour to represent for 12 years until 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir John Quick, one of the principal architects of the Australian Constitution and Federation was the first Federal member for Bendigo and his political career and my own have several similarities. We both have resided at Quarry Hill, a suburb of Bendigo; we both represented the area of Bendigo in Victorian State politics; and Sir John Quick and I both suffered the political discomfort of a redistribution. Sir John lost his seat in 1889 and the seat of Bendigo Province was abolished in 1988. Sir John Quick was elected unopposed as the first Federal member for Bendigo in 1901. My word, politics has changed somewhat since those days. At the 24 March poll I was one of seven candidates to contest the seat of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an honour for me to be the member for the electorate of Bendigo, and only the second Liberal Party member to be elected to represent that area. I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the people in the electorate who gave me their support and confidence. The electorate of Bendigo, with a population in the vicinity of 100,000 people, comprises the cities of Bendigo and Maryborough and the towns of St Arnaud, Charlton, Wedderburn, Maldon and Elmore, to name but a few. The area has a grand history, being famous initially for its goldfields and the large amount of gold taken from the district since 1851, and in more recent times for its primary production, its retail centres, educational establishments and famous tourist attractions-the Bendigo talking trams, the Central Deborah Gold Mine, the Bendigo Pottery, the Shamrock Hotel and the renowned goldfields areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, since Federation there has always been a city of Bendigo although its size and shape and the number of its electors have altered frequently due to redistribution. So it is an electorate with a wonderful blend of city and country and a cross-section of people who reflect just about every lifestyle and occupation, ranging from primary production through secondary industry to the many and varied professions-if you like, Australia on a smaller scale. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of Federation, Sir John Quick, as the member for Bendigo, represented an electorate that was predominantly rural in character, with mining and its support industries being the principal exception. In those days Bendigo led the world in deep mining technology. Dozens of home-grown foundries and engineering works produced a massive variety of equipment which was simply the best that one could buy. Unfortunately, as the gold became more difficult to win, due principally to rising water problems, the mining industry in Bendigo declined, and with it the support industries. This was in itself a great pity because the expertise that resided in Bendigo could have been kept together and marketed to the newly developing deep mines of Kalgoorlie and South Africa. But no such strategy developed and the industry was lost. In a sense we have not progressed far from that in some other aspects of Australian industry; I will have more to say about those industries later on. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the urban area of Bendigo is a bustling place of some 70,000 people. It is a regional centre and as such provides a wide variety of people-based services, both private and government. Possibly the most dramatic change has occurred in the central business district, which has expanded almost fourfold over the last 25 years. Whilst this has resulted in some very modern buildings, Bendigo has retained the best of the old, ensuring its reputation as one of the finest Victorian era cities in the Commonwealth of Australia. Industry has developed too. Since World War II there has been a growing base of manufacturing industry ranging from heavy engineering through to textiles. A number of these industries process locally produced raw materials and this is the greatest wealth producer for any community by far. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bendigo Federal electorate is very well served with educational facilities, ranging from primary schools through to a number of secondary colleges, the Bendigo Senior High School-the first in Victoria-right through to the Loddon Campaspe College of Technical and Further Education and Bendigo College of Advanced Education, which is soon to become affiliated with the Latrobe University. </PARA>
<PARA> The other major centres of population, Maryborough, St Arnaud and Charlton, are also important service centres. Maryborough, which is situated in the south-west of the electorate, has a population of approximately 8,000. Among its major employers is the Maryborough Knitting Mills, which has provided an important avenue of employment for a very long time. Unfortunately, this firm has fallen within the ambit of the changed Government policies on tariffs and the downturn in the economy at the same time. The industry now faces the challenges of the future. Another long-established firm is Patience and Nicholson Ltd, which specialises in toolmaking and fencing products, while a more recent establishment is that of Allens Sweets (Vic) Pty Ltd, which employs about 200 people and literally turns out Kool Mints by the ton. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the most interesting facet of employment in Maryborough is the printing industry. Maryborough has developed into the print capital of country Australia, with about 500 people employed in the industry. The Maryborough Council is active in the support of the municipality and is presently planning to develop the business district along heritage lines to retain up to $10m which is presently spent in other retail centres. </PARA>
<PARA> St Arnaud to the west has a district population of 4,000 and industries ranging from stock food production to engineering and textiles. A local firm, Goldacres Spraying Equipment, has recently doubled production and sends its equipment throughout Australia. The St Arnaud Council is active in fostering industry and has built factories for lease purchase. The local newspaper, North Central News, has formed a new division called Creative Rural Printers and now publishes specialist periodicals-the Market Place News, which sells 10,000 copies a month Australia-wide and is the voice of the fruit and vegetable industry-while a new one for the hospitality industry has recently been established. </PARA>
<PARA> Charlton, the gateway to the Mallee region, services a rich wheat and wool growing district. Charlton is also the home of an enormous beef and dairy feedlot which has several thousand cattle under intensive feeding conditions. Agriculture throughout the electorate is diverse. Around Bendigo one finds small irrigation holdings producing vegetables and lucerne, poultry farming and a number of intensive piggeries. Elsewhere, there are orchards around the Harcourt district and in other places dairying, wheat and other crops and, particularly around St Arnaud, Elmore, and Charlton, wheat and sheep production. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the importance of the region, a large number of government departments are represented in Bendigo. It is a pity that a Federal government office building, which has been mooted for many years, has not yet been built. I urge the Government to get on with this project as quickly as possible. The present arrangement, with Federal departments operating out of leased premises in many different parts of the city, does not make for efficiency in respect of the departments, nor does it help people who are seeking service. Some of the departments are presently spread out over a distance of some seven kilometres. If most departments could be located together, the cost saving efficiency would be of tremendous benefit both to departments and to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the point I am making is that, generally speaking, Bendigo offers a lot to its residents. Whether it is in education, retail, health care or recreation, the Bendigo federal electorate can provide a high level of service with its available facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Having presented the House with an update of the electorate, I would now like to turn to other matters. Honourable members may recall that I mentioned the failure of Bendigo engineering industry to meet the challenge of extending its markets at the local level or overseas when the local gold mining declined. It seems to me that the same picture has recurred time and time again, and this Parliament should really try to do something about it. The most recent balance of trade figures demonstrate this quite clearly. Often we hear of the development of Australian technology, only to hear a short time later that the manufacturing rights have been sold out, and usually cheaply, to other more enterprising nations. Examples I can readily bring to mind include the landing system for aircraft, the black box flight recorder and the Sarich rotary engine. Regretfully many of these products are being manufactured overseas. Somehow as a nation we have to develop the courage to support manufacturing here and be prepared to view the world as our marketplace. As my leader said earlier, we should set an agenda for the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> Our failure to capitalise on our inventiveness has cost this country dearly in terms of employment and export dollars. Our failure is just as great by not insisting that a value be added to our exports of raw materials. It is nothing short of criminal for a country to have high unemployment, such as we have in country Australia, and at the same time allow raw materials to be exported in their most basic form. We are really just digging up our own backyard and selling it off. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example or two as to what I mean. Let us take iron ore. Australia sends iron ore, together with coking coal, overseas to enable the Japanese to use both and make steel to send back to Australia as finished goods, and we buy it. Surely we would be within our rights to insist that these basic materials should be taken to at least the first stage of production and that iron or steel itself be shipped. It would, of course, be preferable to insist that further stages of production be completed here so that Australians benefit to the maximum from our great natural resources. At present we take the easy way out and allow ourselves to be hoodwinked into selling our raw materials cheaply to enable other countries to add the value and then send them back for us to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a well known fact that for every job in secondary industry up to four other jobs are created elsewhere in the community. Manufacturing is one of the real powerhouses of the economy. Surely we owe it to ourselves as Australians to capitalise on the advantages that can flow from it. Adding value to our exports is also a matter to be addressed in the context of our primary industry. I will give another example: there is a very large world market for the production of goods made from sheepskins and we in this country can meet a large proportion of that demand. This is an area in which I have had some personal experience and involvement. Some years ago, whilst a member of another place, I assisted a Bendigo firm, Carlile Brothers, sheep and skin dealers, to establish a tannery, in conjunction with a New Zealand firm, in Bendigo to treat sheepskins prior to export. This resulted in Bendigo gaining a manufacturing industry and the community getting the spin-off from the value added. Still more could be done in this field by manufacturing leather garments for export. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst on the subject of manufacturing industry, I would not be doing my job if I did not raise the matter of employment in country areas. Like most of non-metropolitan Australia, my electorate has a higher level of unemployment than the Australian average. In large measure this problem could be overcome if aggressive policies were adopted for balanced development in this country. Exhaustive studies have been done to demonstrate conclusively the huge cost of adding growth to the metropolitan cities compared with centres such as Bendigo. Whilst on the one hand the metropolitan areas of Melbourne and Sydney have virtually no untapped infrastructure, places such as Bendigo, St Arnaud and Maryborough have capacity, and could absorb a considerable amount of new development at much less cost to the nation as a whole. It is also cheaper for people to live in provincial areas and, of course, the lifestyle itself is in so many ways superior. </PARA>
<PARA> The Governor-General in his speech gave us a picture of what the Government proposes for the period ahead. I will be pleased to note the progress as it is made. During the recent election campaign the Government spelled out in greater detail its proposals for the Bendigo electorate. These promises totalled more than 30, and included such things as the building of new Commonwealth offices in Bendigo; the transfer of the School of Agriculture from Latrobe University in Melbourne to Bendigo; the Bendigo College of Advanced Technology, Technology Park; the Wedderburn Multi-Purpose Health Centre; $246m on roads; development and expansion of the salinity task force; and research into high technology food processing. I will not go through the 30 promises. As the elected member it will be my duty to monitor each of those proposals as I know my constituents' expectations are that they will be implemented by the Government. I will be monitoring that very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the interests of the residents of the Bendigo electorate shall be of paramount importance in my objective to obtain an improved lifestyle for them, one in which education, health, employment opportunities, recreation and security for the future in a healthy environment are important ingredients. It is indeed an honour and a privilege for me to represent the electorate of Bendigo in the Parliament of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I address Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90, Appropriation Bill (No. 4), 1989-90 Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1989-90, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1990-91, the Supply Bill (No. 2) 1990-91 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1990-91, may I start by congratulating the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) on an excellent speech. There is no question that he will make a very fine representative for the people of his electorate and I wish him well. What a great start he has made tonight!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are debating Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90 together with five other Appropriation and Supply Bills. The Bills form part of the traditional Budget package, including Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which appropriate moneys additional to those in the Budget legislation passed last year. The supply Bills are historically introduced around this time of the year to provide funding for government activities undertaken in the first five months of the next financial year, that is, until the legislation introduced in the 1990 Budget is expected to be passed. In effect, it is an advance to the Government against next financial year's Budget funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition parties do not oppose this package of legislation. However, we do have much to say about the Government's Budget strategy and its total economic package of which these Bills form a part. We deplore the Government's steady as she goes policy. We say that it would be better interpreted as a steady as she goes under policy. I will make a few remarks tonight about some of the things that ought to be done better in terms of economic management. As a result I move the following second reading amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> `whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the worrying relaxation of fiscal policy, as signalled by additional gross expenditure since the 1989 Budget of over $1 billion;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) that the Hawke/Keating Government should immediately formulate a tighter fiscal strategy involving budget cutbacks;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) that this strategy should be accompanied by the announcement of a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy that must include extensive labour market and microeconomic reform; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) that the Australian economy cannot hope to deal with its stagflationary problems and enormous growth in foreign debt unless the Government adopts a tighter fiscal strategy and a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy as matters of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>Listeners will have noted that the second reading amendment contains a reference to over $1 billion in additional expenditure in the appropriation Bills. The Opposition has had something to say about that in recent days. We have had a response from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). It was a very weak and pathetic response today during Question Time. He failed to answer the very simple charge, that is, that the Government has greatly increased expenditure and has thus relaxed fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation represents the first instalment of what was a vote buying spree before the last election. This Government has been out buying off interest groups from one end of the country to another. For example, it gives the first accurate figures on the massive cost of the Government's disastrous mismanagement of the airline pilots strike. Appropriation Bills Nos. 3 and 4 contain $101.3m in additional expenditure directly resulting from the pilots dispute. That includes $70m in payments to the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority for charges waived to assist the two major airlines to weather the dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Most Australian taxpayers will remember this Government buying off the Australian Council of Trade Unions with taxpayers' money, just to buy the ACTU's compliance when the Government failed to throw the book at the trade union that was involved in this strike at the start. The Government had an alternative. We came into this Parliament and offered legislation, the armoury, to nip that strike in the bud, which is what should have happened. The Government's ACTU mates would not have a bar of effective compliance measures in our industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), Mr Consensus, declared war on the pilots. Over all these years he was seen to be a great consensus man. I remember the weekend well. For years he said that he was opposed to section 45d. On that weekend he declared war on the pilots and said, `Take them off to common law'. What hypocrisy! The Government's policy on the airline pilots dispute was a monument to hypocrisy. He declared war. Instead of finishing the thing off there and then it was trench warfare and the innocent bystanders, the Australian public, had to suffer the monumental costs of the pilots dispute. There is evidence of that in cold hard cash terms. It came straight out of the pockets of ordinary Australians. In addition, there was $31.8m to help repair the crippled tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not be in any doubt that the financial cost is not restricted to this $101m. Literally hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost as a result of this Government's mishandling of the pilots dispute. Honourable members should remember the Prime Minister saying that there is no strike on, that it is only a dispute. What nonsense! The people of Australia know what nonsense it was. Nothing represents better the essential stupidity of the Prime Minister and the Government's stand on the pilots strike. Nothing has more typified the failure of the ossified centralised wage system perpetrated by the Hawke-Keating Government and the ACTU accord than the pilots strike. It was a classic Aussie dispute-employer and employee slugging it out to the cost of the innocent bystander. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills introduced by the Government go part of the way to explaining why interest rates are so high. They represent an alarming acceleration in the trend towards looser fiscal policy. To put them into perspective, they represent a net additional expenditure after accounting for savings of $664.7m. That compares with $217m of additional expenditure in 1988-89 and only $89m in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA> We say as a matter of urgency that the Government should review its expenditure policies and procedures. It ought to adopt the $3,000m in expenditure cuts that we outlined in our Economic Action Plan in the second half of last year. Some members of the public gallery might remember that one of the good parts of that proposal was our simple suggestion that we ought to do something about unemployment benefits in this country. It is an absurd proposition that we can go on to the unemployment benefit in this country and stay there until we are ready for the aged pension. What nonsense that is. The Government ought to do something about it. There are considerable savings there for the public purse. We put up the proposition. We have done the figuring and the calculations for the Government. All it has to do is have the sense to pick up that straightforward proposition. In contrast, we have had nothing but indications to the contrary. They are indications suggesting that fiscal policy may be loosened even further. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very revealing article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 April 1990 there is evidence of the heavy backgrounding of the Treasurer's office. Incredibly the article said that the overall tightness of fiscal policy will slip during the next financial year to produce the first real increase in Federal Budget spending since 1985-86. It says further that the public sector borrowing requirement could even slip back into deficit in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a policy change would be very dangerous. Given the significant wage growth locked in under accord mark 6 to ease fiscal policy further is exactly the wrong direction to take when inflation and interest rates are at such high levels. All it will mean is that the Government will have to continue with its one dimensional policy of tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates. Most Australians have had enough of Labor's continuing high interest rate policy. The Treasurer obviously has just not learned any of the lessons from his policy failures during the last Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned-I must say that in the past couple of weeks since I have had this job as shadow Treasurer I have talked to people in the business community and the financial world to find it is a concern increasingly shared in those quarters-that all the signs are that this Government will repeat the lack of action of the last term of Parliament. I mention some who share that concern. Who else shares that concern? It is none other than Senator Walsh. He is a person of some experience. He has been at the centre of economic policy decision making of this Government for many years. When he says that there is reason to be concerned then I think the whole country ought to stop and pay very close attention to what he says. </PARA>
<PARA> After the election in 1987, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer polished their rhetoric on the need for micro-economic reform. It was the so-called agenda of the third Hawke Government. Who remembers the headlines, week after week? This was the new beginning. The historic term of the Hawke Government. The Hawke Government was going to do this, it was going to do that-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was going to bring home the bacon, as the honourable member for Higgins says. We have heard it all before. It is amazing. If one took this week's or last week's headlines and went back to those of three years ago one would see they are virtually duplicated. No wonder it is that there is concern by people like Senator Walsh as to what the Government is going to do. As we all know, in that term of office, basically nothing much materialised-just all hot air and our economic problems piling one on top of the other. The net foreign debt reached $117 billion in the March quarter of 1990, and now it is probably $120 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday the Treasurer was at the National Press Club delivering a speech on what he thought the Opposition should not do with its tax policy. He has just been elected and his first major speech is telling us what we should not do with one of our policies. He ought to have been in the Parliament, for starters. There was all this hot air from the Government about respecting the Parliament and on day one it did not meet its own standard. He ought to have been in the Parliament. What should he have been talking about? Not our tax policy. We will reveal our tax policy when it suits us to reveal our tax policy. He ought to have been in the Parliament saying what the Government intends to do to tackle Australia's serious economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Those problems are easily summed up on one word, stagflation. It is an ugly word for an ugly condition. It can best be described as a condition of rapidly rising prices with high unemployment and a stagnant economy; that is, stagnation plus inflation equals stagflation. It is a shorthand description. Honourable members will have heard it used often during the 1970s to describe the economic malaise which Australia suffered at that time. That situation, of course, was a direct result of the destructive policies of the Whitlam Government. Sadly, it is a description that again accurately describes the economy under another Labor Administration which, by the end of this parliamentary term, will have ruled this country for 13 of the last 20 years and should be known as the stagflationary party, because that is the way it takes this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the two components of stagflation, that is, inflation and stagnation or, particularly, recession. The March quarter Consumer Price Index released last Wednesday saw the official annual inflation rate raise to 8.6 per cent. Simply put, inflation in this country is just too high. It is becoming a cliche to note that since 1982 the rate of inflation has been around twice that of the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation robs the savings of pensioners. Inflation distorts investment decisions. Inflation makes us uncompetitive. We ought to be attacking inflation. We ought to be eradicating inflation. What do we find from this Government? We find a set of policies which keeps inflation high. When one looks a bit closer, that actually suits the Government. When one looks at the Government's tax receipts-as its tax receipts were looked at very closely by an independent firm, Access Economics-since 1983-84 inflation, taxation by stealth through inflation, has put $22 billion extra in the back pocket of the Treasurer, and he reckons he takes the hard decisions on tax. What a joke, and every Australian who pays it, knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> Contributing to this continually high inflation rate is the failure, under the Hawke-Keating Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions accord, to constrain nominal wage growth. Year after year, nominal wage growth in Australia significantly exceeds that of the average of OECD countries. With the level of wages growth for 1990-91 already locked in under accord mark 6, there is very little scope for a substantial fall in inflation. The recent OECD report on the Australian economy states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . nominal wage increases now appear locked in the range of 7 per cent a year while price increases are currently running in the range of 6.5 to 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people get extra dollars in their wage packets but by the time they tear it open the Taxation Department has got some, and by the time they get to the supermarket those dollars are worth less. That is Labor's low wage policy. It is one of the great ironies of Australian politics that this Party, which claims to be for the average worker, actually boasts how it is that it has reduced real wages in this country. This Government reckons that is successful economic management. I have got news for the Government. We disagree with it, and I think of the Australian electorate disagrees with it. We want higher wages not lower wages, and the Government ought to be thinking about policies which will achieve that result. That is the inflation component of the stagflation equation. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, it cannot be denied that Australia has a stagnant, recessed economy. But honourable members do not have to take my word for it. I will quote from a senior Cabinet Minister and, until recently, two of his cabinet colleagues. On 22 April 1990 the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who is very lucky to still be in the Cabinet with a job, said on television:</PARA>
<PARA> We are likely to see a significant slowdown in growth and we certainly could be in negative growth for one or two quarters. It's quite possible. </PARA>
<PARA>He agreed with his interviewer that this technically amounted to a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 May 1990, who really let the cat out of the bag? Who was the man who said, to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, that effectively they were lying? Who was it? None other than Senator Walsh. What did Senator Walsh say? He wrote the following in his column:</PARA>
<PARA> As we have so often done before, Australia has resorted to inducing a domestic recession to deal (temporarily) with a balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government engineered a recession, something which has been vehemently denied by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, but one of the blokes who was actually part of the decision making has let the cat out of the bag. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WI4">Mr REITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He tells the truth. Government members are all jumping on Walsh with a fair level of excitement but, of course, he has told the truth. He let the cat out of the bag. Labor has engineered a recession to deal with our problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Tuesday, 8 May 1990 the former Minister for Administrative Services, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), said on ABC radio that he was of the opinion that the economy was `sliding into a recession as a result of macro policy'. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the Treasurer seems to be the only person of note not to have directly responded to the OECD report. When was the last time that happened? When was the last time we had such silence on a report from the OECD from the Federal Treasurer of the day? I say to the Treasurer that the only consolation is that he has the Prime Minister in tow in his denial of the existence of a recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the words carefully and closely. The Treasurer has been denying all references to a technical recession as being two quarters of negative gross domestic product growth and said that a recession should be defined as-he has his own definition-`rapidly mounting unemployment, business failures and people trying to sell assets when they can't'. Given record business bankruptcies, today's unemployment figures showing an upward trend and the unemployment level seemingly having topped off maybe the Treasurer's definition just about fits the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it fits another bill-another one of the Treasurer's definitions. Next Tuesday is the anniversary of the announcement of banana republic day. It is fascinating to go back four years and hear the Treasurer talk about economics and the definition of where we are going. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> And if we don't make it this time, we never will make it. If this Government cannot get the adjustment, get manufacturing going again and keep moderate wage outcomes and a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will just end up being a third-rate economy. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The prognosis is, the only way you can deal with the massive current account imbalance, is to close the economy down. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that is revealing, is it not? That is the policy Senator Walsh announced that in fact Mr Keating is now following. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> You cut all growth to zero--</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting, too, because that is just about where we are. He then stated:</PARA>
<PARA>you stop all the imports growing and unemployment starts rising again, and profits fall apart, and we go back to being the kind of economy we were in 1982 . . . or worse. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Laws then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Or worse. I mean that's a perfect description of a depression. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> If in the final analysis, Australia is so undisciplined, so disinterested in its salvation and its economic well being, fall back solution is inevitable because you can't fund $12 billion a year in perpetuity every year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now let me just stop there. It was $12 billion a year. What is the figure now? It is about $20 billion a year in perpetuity. That is where we are. Then he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>and then the interest on the year before that, and the interest on the year before that, the only thing to do is to slow the growth down to a canter. Once you slow the growth under 3 per cent, unemployment starts to rise again. </PARA>
<PARA>John Laws said:</PARA>
<PARA> And then you have really induced a depression. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Then you have gone. You are a banana republic. </PARA>
<PARA>John Laws replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It's pretty serious, isn't it?</PARA>
<PARA>Not a bad question four years later: `It's pretty serious, isn't it?'. I say to the Treasurer: `What has changed, mate? What's changed? Look at the parameters of the Australian economy today and let us hear your response'. The fact is, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is every prospect that unemployment is going to climb in the next few months. Access Economics, to quote them again, for example predicts the unemployment rate to be around 7.5 per cent by mid-1991. Therefore, I think we are pretty justified in pointing to a stagnant economy and I have the Treasurer, I think, as my authority. As I said before, stagnation plus inflation, equals stagflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1988 Treasurer Keating nominated inflation as our No.1 economic disease. The truth is, though, he has done nothing to combat it. In fact, his grand plan `to bring home the bacon' back in the Budget of 1988 has turned out to be one of the greatest political economic failures of recent Australian modern politics. He was going to get our inflation down. This was his big dash, his big program, to achieve the one thing that we say still needs to be achieved and, as a first step, to get inflation down to that of our international competitors. What worries us is that he failed then, he now has no anti-inflationary strategy and, worse still, he is distracted by his own prime ministerial ambitions and he has lost the stomach for the fight. His instincts left now are the instincts of the spoiler. </PARA>
<PARA> Foremost among the policy prescriptions needed to make up an anti-inflationary strategy are monetary policy stability, tight fiscal policy, labour market reform and micro-economic reform. As a matter of urgency the Government should begin conducting monetary policy with the medium term objective of reducing, and eventually eliminating, inflation. As a first step the Government should adopt the recommendations of the Business Council of Australia, which we adopt, that within the life of the Parliament there should be an explicit commitment to reducing inflation to no more and desirably less than the average rate experienced by our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> Step two: the disastrous accord mark 6, drafted during the heat of an election campaign, should not be implemented. To do so would only continue, if not worsen, the current economic malaise Australia finds itself in. The Treasurer ought to ring up Bill Kelty and say to him, `Now listen, Bill; the country cannot afford it', because it cannot. We need an inflationary strategy. That means they have to look at their whole industrial relations policy. They have to look at better ways of doing things. It is not just the Opposition saying things like this. Senator Walsh, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, even that bloke in the Trades Hall Council of New South Wales who put out a report. Mr Duffy got the sack for telling the truth. You know, one ought to ring Walsh. </PARA>

That should be followed by an August Budget producing further real reductions in outlays and a firm commitment to target a reduction in inflation and nominal wages growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the first steps of a comprehensive economic strategy. They will not be easy to implement and they will require a lot of determination. And, of course, as I say, as the first steps you can add industrial relations reform as was mentioned by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) today in the matter of public importance. He put forward the very substantial, the unarguable case for industrial relations reform and pointed out the pivotal nature of that reform. But there are so many other areas-for example, the waterfront. I welcome Senator Collins saying that his job would be on the line in 12 months time if he did not achieve it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe he should. I welcome his statement but we have just heard it all before. As Professor Geoffrey Blainey explained in his speech at the National Business Summit on Debt in March:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The idea of painlessly solving our debt problem is still foremost in most of our minds. It should not be. We tried it in the last few years and we failed. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, the problems of stagflation and high foreign debt are apparent. They are clear to everybody. The answers are known and we say that the opportunity to fight the problems still exist and the Government has a political mandate. It won the election. What do the Australian people want? They want to see their interest rate bill cut. They want to see something done about foreign debt. They want to see this country prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the opportunity and we say to the Government: `Look, if you go down the right road, you will have our support'. The Leader of the Opposition has made that very clear and it is a very sensible and constructive approach he has taken to these issues. The Government ought to take up the offer. If it does not, we will get to the next election, the economy will be worse than it is now, but the problems, the issues, the decisions to be made, will basically still be the same. However we will need a double dose of the economic medicine to cure the economic ills that will build up as the Government sits on its hands. </PARA>
<PARA> So I say to the Government, `Take your opportunity'. The Treasurer wants to be Prime Minister. If he wants to be Prime Minister, he ought to be a good Treasurer first. He has not been much of a Treasurer up to now but he ought to take his opportunity because this economy calls out for a firm hand, it calls out for some leadership, it calls out so obviously for a change of tack and a government we say with the will to tackle the problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has great courtroom flair. He can convince us that black is white and if I were in trouble with the law, he would be the first one I would go to. He even has convinced millions of Australians to vote against the referendum which meant that the people would be properly compensated for land that was acquired by State governments. Now, right along the route of the very fast train, people are complaining that State governments do not have to properly compensate them. I wish a lot of Australians had thought about that when they were voting in the referendum. So he is pretty good at looking good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you actually look at the arguments of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition things do not look so good. Just look at this list of amendments that have been put out by the honourable member. First of all, he complains about additional gross expenditure. The same Party was supporting a massive blow-out in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, from $800m about a year ago to $1.3 billion at the moment and possibly another 25 per cent added in the next year. The cost has escalated 25 per cent a year and yet the Opposition members were not really prepared to say how they would deal with the costs and they certainly were not going to tackle the matter in any courageous way. </PARA>
<PARA> During the election they made plenty of suggestions for increasing expenditure-on roads, for instance. My neighbour, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), talked about increased expenditure on roads, as did a lot of other Opposition parliamentarians. They had plenty of suggestions about increasing gross expenditure. The honourable member talks about Budget cutbacks. That is not what they gave us when we came to power in 1983. There was no evidence of Budget cutbacks. We inherited a $9 billion deficit, which has now been turned into a surplus of over $9 billion by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talks about labour market and micro-economic reform. At the same time he talks about the pilots. What sort of situation would we be in if we had done what honourable members opposite wanted us to do with regard to the pilots? They would have left us with an airline industry which would not deal with competition, which could not be deregulated successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talks about foreign debt. We had years of conservatism when we accepted high commodity prices, increased protection and created inefficient industries. That is what the previous Government left us with. Honourable members opposite are living in the past. They will not tell us what they would do. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did not tell us this afternoon what they would do. They did just what they did during the election campaign-criticising the Government all the time but not actually coming up with concrete plans themselves. I believe that is why they did not succeed in getting into government in very difficult economic times. Tonight the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not tell us what they would do. All he did was criticise. </PARA>
<PARA> National Party members would love to tell us what we ought to do. They would love to tell us about increased expenditure on roads and in other areas. But at the moment they are very much the tail on the dog which is hardly wagging. Their numbers have suffered. We have an influx into this House of people like the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) who appeared on a platform with me in Cooma and argued for less expenditure on roads. There will be some difficult times for the Opposition ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite talked about expenditure cuts of $300m during the election campaign but it was difficult to tell-we could not tell and the people could not tell-where those expenditure cuts were to come from. They talked about abolishing unemployment benefits. They talked about people staying on benefits all their lives. We are getting rid of unemployment benefits altogether-not after six months or a year. We are revolutionising the whole system so that people are paid if they are prepared to train. We are taking a completely different approach, getting away from the approach of the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> The sort of thing the Opposition would do would really hit people over 40, 45 and 50 years of age who have worked all their lives-conscientious workers-and who have been retrenched. I could give numerous examples, Mr Deputy Speaker. No doubt you could, too. These people exist in country towns. They have been retrenched and cannot find other jobs. They have been trained specifically in a particular type of job and cannot adapt to another type of job. The Opposition would wipe them off unemployment benefits after a few months. We will not do that. We will ask them to take the opportunity to train. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great things that happened today was the legislation that was put through on training by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) so that we get away from the old concepts. Having an unemployment benefit but then suddenly abolishing it and putting people off the dole would cost more in welfare. Or does the Opposition want what happened in the United States? One can go there today and see people walking around with their worldly possessions in shopping trolleys. I have seen it in Los Angeles and New York. People who have been taken off benefits or thrown out of institutions are just walking around the streets. That is the sort of thing the Opposition wants. Opposition members think that is good economics but they do not consider people. One of the good things about the Appropriation Bills tonight is that we are actually spending money on important areas like this.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite tell us about how there is conflict in the Government. It is nothing like the conflict in the Opposition parties. We have listened to Senator Walsh. He has been a great factor in what this Government has done, uniquely, since 1983. We have tackled a whole range of inherited macro-economic problems and now micro-economic problems. At the same time we have minimised the effect on unemployment. It has been the unique contribution of this Government that it was not prepared to have wholesale unemployment at the sorts of levels we had under the previous administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite talked about the need for higher wages. They said that they are the party for higher wages. Would they get higher wages through their system of enterprise bargaining? I can see what would happen in towns like Bombala and Braidwood, in the electorate of Eden-Monaro. One could think of similar towns in north Queensland in the electorate of the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who is in the House tonight, and similar towns in the electorates of many honourable members. In these towns people do not have a choice. If the boss says to them, `Sorry Mary', or `Sorry Bill', I can only give you $5 an hour; that is the minimum legislated amount I can pay you, that is enterprise bargaining. They have little choice. </PARA>
<PARA> Less scrupulous people would use that system to force people into taking lower incomes. Other people with more scruples would be forced into the system to keep their costs down so that they could compete. The highly unionised people in the cities would be able to take advantage of enterprise bargaining and get higher wages, but not the people in small country towns, not the non-unionised, women or the disadvantaged. That is why we adhere to the system of arbitration and why we will not support a system of enterprise bargaining which is divorced from having basic awards in each area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Supply Bills have given political assassins an axe to remove governments, yet they give life to administration. That is what we are doing tonight. Expansive policies which took Australia into long overdue urban and regional development were reflected in the Supply Bills of the Whitlam Government, as was the historic 1975 refusal of Supply under the sensible Hayden Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Supply Bills often make history. The Supply Bills from 1975 to 1983 reflected the uncomfortable changes in the Liberal Party. The National Party just tagged along. The dry forces began the development of philosophies which are much more evident now in this Liberal Party of the Thirty-Sixth Parliament. But unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for country people, with the loss of Charles Blunt and John Stone, the National Party of today is back where it was. In total, the conservative parties are a confusing conglomerate. That is the dilemma of the conservative parties today. We will see this brought out on the conservative side in the next years of this Thirty-Sixth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Even in difficult times many Australians have found the alternative to Labor too confusing and too unstable and have not not been prepared to accept it. There are problems and major philosophical differences within the Liberal Party, but especially between the Liberal Party and the National Party. They are trying to amalgamate in some areas, knowing full well that, if they do, there will always be some rural rump in some area--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Victoria, and I believe that in Western Australia there is an attempt to form even a Liberal-National Party branch. It could not exactly be called a love match between the Liberal and National parties in Victoria. I can recall Victorian members of the National Party being opposed to the commitment in Vietnam and giving preferences to Labor. I can recall them being in government with the Australian Labor Party sitting behind them and the Liberal Party in Opposition. There is a long history in Victoria that will make that match very difficult. It certainly will not be a love match.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Nationals and Liberals unite, they are condemned to lose ground in country areas. Local Country Party people will come up again because there is a conflict. The Liberals want to adopt the user-pay principle and they support a privatisation, while the Nationals say that they do not mind talking about deregulation as long as it does not mean getting rid of Telecom Australia, as long as the cross-subsidisation does not stop and as along as they continue to get their road and rail services in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> The message that the National Party finds so hard to get across sometimes is that the biggest proportion of our exports comes from country areas and it is worth Telecom cross-subsidising. If the Liberal Party wants to sell off the lucrative parts of Telecom and perhaps Australia Post and to sell off enterprises such as the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Cooma and take people from the country, put up country costs or taxes or reduce services, or the lot, National Party people know that there will be great difficulties. The future ideological direction of the coalition has to be seen to be in a great deal of doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, through the Supply and Appropriation Bills this Government has begun to implement the important policies that were set out before the 1990 election. Let us look briefly at some of the things that have been announced in this Parliament in the last two days. Regarding training, employers with national payrolls of 200,000 and more will be required to spend one per cent on eligible training exercises. They will have a wide range of options to choose from, including making donations to institutions if they do not want to have structured training for their employees. But they will be required to contribute. This will mean that we will be able to move along the road of getting away from the dole concept. We will be able to get rid of the dole and give people training opportunities. They will get paid if they are prepared to train. </PARA>
<PARA> The increases in non-pension income before paying tax, which we announced pre-election, were dealt with in legislation introduced yesterday. Non-profit making sporting bodies and community service organisations are given tax exemption through legislation that has been introduced in the last two days. By giving incentives to young people to continue studying we have got rid of the terrible gap that existed between the time when people left school and the time when they got a job. People have got into the rut of unemployment because of that gap after they left school. We are stopping that from happening by giving young people an incentive to continue to study and by insisting on training. We are not just saying, `You can train if you want to'. Unemployment benefit no longer exists. They must train. They will get paid for training that will lead to a job. </PARA>
<PARA> We are giving people incentives to take out superannuation. These incentives will give them security and get us away from all the tests that we have to apply continually as the number of people who are living longer increases. The life expectation of all of us is much longer. If we rely only on pensions the tests will have to get harder. We do not want firmer assets tests and income tests: we want people to get a just return through paying into superannuation schemes. Of course, people will continue to get a pension but it will not be as expensive to pay them. I refer to those who may have been carrying out home duties or involved in other areas and have not had superannuation. Superannuation schemes will give Australia a large amount of savings that can be used to develop Australia. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has the inner strength to make the hard decisions and yet at the same time show compassion towards people. We also have the inner strength to develop a planned method of deregulating the economy which will not create massive unemployment. I believe that the micro-economic reforms that are being introduced will succeed. I ask the Opposition whether it has the inner strength and can be fair. Even if it does have the inner strength there will be a lot of conflict within the Opposition and within this Parliament that will not exist within the Government because we are able to continue the direction we have taken which is to give Australia economic strength and at the same time show fairness towards people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation and Supply Bills include the appropriations for the parliamentary departments. I want to deal firstly with the important issue of the conduct of proceedings in this House. The Opposition has raised this matter quite seriously at the outset of this Parliament and I remind the House that at the valedictory session at the close of the last Parliament I placed on record my very strong views about the conduct of the House during the last Parliament. I addressed my remarks to both sides of the House saying that there were very serious questions about democracy in Australia resulting from the failure of this Parliament to meet up to its responsibilities to allow satisfactory discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the matter has been taken up seriously in this Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) clearly got wind of the proposals that were going to be put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and, in his remarks, tried to get in first with some apologia for the Government's behaviour in this regard in the last Parliament. Most people agree-indeed the Government has not denied this-that the conduct of this House, due to the actions basically of Ministers in the House, particularly in Question Time, has led to a very serious deterioration in the value of this House as a parliamentary forum. I personally believe it is an absolute disgrace that at a time when people in eastern Europe are fighting for basic freedoms that we have enjoyed for a very long time we should treat these things in such a cursory and peremptory fashion in this House. This House hardly need exist the way some Ministers have treated it in the past. I am hopeful that in this Parliament there will be some genuine attempt at reform. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters were raised by the Leader of the Opposition and my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) on Tuesday. I note with very great regret that the Sydney Morning Herald, in its report of parliamentary proceedings on Tuesday, trivialised this matter. Mr Mike Seccombe, the person who reports what happens in this House, put in a very large article on the parliamentary reporting page headed `Boredom for some, trivia for all as Parliament opens'. He referred to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hewson said the standard of parliamentary conduct had reached `possibly its lowest level in memory' under Mr McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last session, the House got through an average of just 10 questions a day, the lowest on record. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fischer continued. Over the past seven years, 28 Opposition members had been suspended, and only one Government member. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt they had a point. But it was an old song, and Mr McLeay in reply simply promised to be as fair as always. </PARA>
<PARA> Of much more interest to most members was the news that Mr McLeay had broken his elbow during the break, when an exercise bike collapsed under him. </PARA>
<PARA>If this Parliament is going to be held in anything other than contempt the person assigned by the serious newspaper, supposedly, in New South Wales to report its proceedings ought to the have more regard for what happens here and what is raised seriously than is given in evidence by this report. This report is a total disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that people have contempt for this place when this kind of report comes out even though the people who occupy this chamber take it upon themselves to try to do something about it. I have the strongest possible concern about this. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for Hume is addressing a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I refer to in relation to the conduct of the House is that despite the remarks of the Prime Minister at the opening of Parliament on Tuesday, I have very great concerns about the sincerity of the Government. What evidence have we had this week? The first major piece of evidence was the Treasurer (Mr Keating) deciding to make a major policy statement on tax to the National Press Club. But he gave this House only the benefit of his opinions in an answer to a dorothy dix question today. That is totally unsatisfactory. This is consistent with the contempt that the Treasurer has always had for the proceedings of this House. It was the Treasurer who said that Question Time is an indulgence the Executive allows the Parliament. This is an outrage in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> On one occasion when I was shadow Treasurer, the Treasurer brought into the House on a Thursday night to be debated the following Tuesday 275 pages of tax legislation, including a 104 or a 105 page Bill on capital gains tax. The Opposition had to consider 275 pages of some of the most complex legislation ever introduced into this House over the weekend. I had to make recommendations to the Opposition shadow cabinet on the Monday and debate the matter on the Tuesday. The explanatory memoranda for these Bills were not tabled in the House until the concluding remarks on the Bill on the Tuesday night after I had spoken and at the conclusion of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The summing up on those 275 pages of legislation were given not by the Treasurer, but by Mr Hurford, who was then the assistant Minister. During the time I was shadow Treasurer there was hardly a time when the Treasurer did other than read a departmental speech of a most cursory nature on the second readings on about 975 pages of new tax legislation. The Treasurer made hardly more than a cursory introduction speech. He was never here for any debate on those subjects. He always sent the assistant Minister, Mr Hurford, in for the summary. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a disgrace. It is contempt of Parliament. There has been no change this week despite the remarks of a mea culpa fashion from the Prime Minister on Tuesday. We, in the Opposition, regard reform of this Parliament and this House as a primary objective. In one way or another we are quite determined to improve the performance of this chamber in the conduct of its democratic responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason I put on record the remarks I did in the valedictory debate, sometimes referred to as the hypocriticals, at the close of the last parliament, was that I wanted my remarks to be quoted against a Liberal National Government if we, coming into office, had not followed those precepts. I purposely put it down for that reason. Therefore, I feel very strongly about this. I am very concerned about the very bad start the Government has made in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Prime Minister's remarks on Tuesday, today he gave very long answers. One of them was quite personally abusive towards one honourable member. The Treasurer gave two very long answers. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) gave two very long answers to dorothy dix questions. There was a very long answer from the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). There was also a very long answer from the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) to a dorothy dix question. Question Time today was very unsatisfactory and not really in line with the spirit of the Prime Minister's remarks on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we, in this chamber-I am told the more important chamber in government in Australia-are having only seven sitting days in seven months of this year to consider legislation of a very important kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Leader of the House, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) brought in a motion to abolish the 11 o'clock rule keeping honourable members here beyond eleven o'clock tonight. Next week there will be guillotines and late nights every night to jam a whole lot of Bills through in two sittings weeks of this Parliament for no obvious reasons. There is stacks of time in the month ahead to deal with these matters at our leisure before they go to the Senate but we have only the most cursory opportunity to look at these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> All this from a minority Government-a Government elected on 39.4 per cent of the primary vote and less than 50 per cent of the two party preferred vote. Its mandate is negligible. Honourable members opposite come into the House prostituting the proceedings and give a very bad example to those countries and those people struggling towards a new democracy in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The economy is clearly in recession. Any of us who have been in contact with our electorates over the last eight weeks have seen a very serious deterioration in economic activity. During that time, every business, large and small, has had a very substantial downturn in its business-more than in the preceding six months, when the figures showed that we were already going into recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The ANZ advertisement survey shows that employment is falling off very substantially. The Government's figures always come late. Treasury figures, statistics by their very nature, are always late. Honourable members in touch with their electorates know that we are going very deeply into recession. We are advised by Senator Walsh, now that he is relieved of the burdens of ministerial office, that this recession was engineered by the Government because of a failure of fiscal, monetary and wages policies and the absence of essential structural reform, has led to a balance of payments crisis. This Government was forced to engineer a recession to try to solve that balance of payments crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically Australia has had difficulty with its balance of payments, particularly at times when commodity prices have gone down. The structural changes are needed to ensure that in the future when we move out of recession we do not automatically go into another balance of payments crisis. That is why structural reform is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members on both sides of the House acknowledge the need for structural reform. But in this case the Government has no answers to that long term problem. It has no vision. Even in those cases where there is a clear need for policy action, it does not have the guts to proceed with those measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that we have been subject to very great external difficulties and that it has taken the tough decisions. I ask: Why are things so tough for Australia? Where are the external forces that are causing such difficulty for the Australian economy? I have read all the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development reports and all the international summaries and I am told-and nobody denies this-that for seven successive years we have had unprecedented growth in the world economy. It has been one the seven best years in the world's economic history. Remarkably, and luckily for the Government, there has been no drought of a truly national nature over this period. </PARA>
<PARA> This is quite different from 1982 when the international recession was the worst since the Great Depression. The drought in 1982 was the worst in Australia in this century. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had quite different conditions for seven years. We have had excellent external conditions and excellent internal conditions. There was some downturn of commodity prices in 1985-86 but it was not major. The external conditions were marvellous. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that Australia, at a time of high commodity prices, of a booming world economy and of no drought anywhere, has a big balance of payments deficit and is loaded with a monumentally large external debt of $148 billion and an inflation rate of 8 per cent-twice that of our trading competitors. Where are the external conditions that have led to this? Why are these tough times for Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> If any body fronted up to the bar of any court with the evidence of total failure in the presence of quite favourable external conditions that the Treasurer seems to have engineered, he or she would be declared guilty without further ado. The fact of the matter is that this Government took over at a time when the rains came and the international recession disappeared. It has had seven marvellous years and at the end of that time we have a country with one of the worst balance of payments crises we have ever had, the worst inflation and on top of that external debt of a higher level than we have ever dreamed of. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us think what would happen if there is some external shock, a downturn in commodity prices, some world recession or even an internal drought. We are desperately exposed to the effects of those things. If any of those things happen, the recession we are in now will be a picnic compared with what will happen then. The responsibility of that rests clearly with this Government and its Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Advice is available from very good sources as to how this might be fixed. One of these sources of advice is the OECD Economic Survey for Australia of 1989/1990. The surveys come from Paris and are quoted widely by governments usually in support of their economic policies. One of the reasons for this is that the treasuries of the recipient countries have an input into the advice given by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Treasuries have always influenced the report, unlike the International Monetary Fund (IMF) whose international reports are published but the country by country reports are not published. I am reliably informed that there is quite a substantial difference between the tone of OECD reports about Australia and the tone of IMF reports which have been far more critical because they are private. </PARA>
<PARA>This OECD report contains two major sets of recommendations which are in total conflict with what the Treasurer is saying. I have no doubt that they are not in conflict with what the Federal Treasury is saying. The Treasurer, in some oversight in the December period when this matter was being discussed-perhaps he was too busy looking at the possibility of succeeding the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) as Prime Minister or looking forward to an election campaign-apparently did not examine the Treasury's input to the OECD. Otherwise, what is the explanation for the OECD, on two quite critical issues, coming in with advice that is quite different from what the Treasurer is talking about at the moment. I have concluded that the Federal Treasury is in fundamental conflict with the Treasurer on these two matters. The first one relates to consumption tax. The OECD report says:</PARA>
<PARA>Further reforms to the tax system could therefore be considered. Australia already obtains a substantial proportion of taxation revenue from indirect taxation. However, this revenue is collected from high rates on a relatively narrow base resulting in significant distortions in relative prices. Moreover, the existing wholesale sales tax only imperfectly removes taxation on inputs used in the manufacture of goods so that an element of indirect taxation remains on exported goods. The introduction of a ``broadly-based consumption tax'' as suggested by the Government at the time of the Tax Summit in 1985 would have a favourable effect on relative prices and would permit further reductions in marginal income-tax rates. A broadly based indirect tax would also have a favourable effect on price competitiveness for goods for export which would not be subject to the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasury would have seen that and I believe approved of it, but it is in total conflict with what the Treasurer said outside this House at the National Press Club the other day. On labour market reform the OECD report states:</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia, the framework of employer-employee relations appears to be a key factor affecting internal labour flexibility and enterprise adaptability. The legal arrangements setting out the rights of employers and employees (referred to as ``awards'' in Australia) differ significantly from most other OECD countries; they are legally enforceable decisions of the industrial tribunals-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose: are they really?-</PARA>
<PARA>they have been set up largely on an occupation or craft basis; and they determine a complex structure of work classifications and working conditions which limit the horizontal and vertical mobility within the firm, impede the adoption of flexible work practices and discourage enterprise training. They have proved difficult to change. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet the Treasurer does not support enterprise agreements, or deregulation of the labour market; clearly he is in conflict with his own Treasury advisers and with the OECD recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we to do with a government that perversely goes against the best advice in the way that it should proceed, has only tackled the easy bits of deregulation, like financial regulation, and has failed to face up to the other issues? There is no evidence from the Governor-General's Speech or the Appropriation Bills that the Government will do any better in the parliamentary period which we are now entering. </PARA>

<PARA> It is not often that honourable members get an opportunity to have a wide ranging debate on issues of special interest to them in this place. Appropriation Bills provide one of those opportunities. These Bills, as mentioned at the second reading stage, provide additional appropriations for unexpected and unavoidable expenditure requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> After listening for some time to the speeches by some members of this House criticising these Bills under consideration, I must say that I share the views of many people in my electorate that the Opposition does not seem to understand the needs and ambitions of the people of Australia. I suppose that view is reflected in the failure of the Opposition to gain a majority of seats in the House of Representatives at the last election. There seems to be on the Opposition's part an absence of realisation that the Government has a responsibility to provide an infrastructure on a national basis: I refer to services, capital works projects and the continuation of those services that we have come to rely upon to maintain our civilisation and our standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you will hear much rhetoric as you sit in that chair when these Bills are discussed. But very rarely will you hear mention made of needs, desires and ambitions of people living in rural Australia, provincial cities of Australia or even remote areas of Australia. There seems to be a concentration on economic theses, discussions on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reports, but we never come to grips with some of the thinking that occurs across this wide horizon called Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My constituents are interested in good roads, good airports, good education and good health services. When they hear Opposition spokesmen talking about cuts of $3 billion in national expenditure, they physically withdraw their voting support. They turn to a party, as they did at the last election that maintains expenditure to ensure that those necessary services are available to them. </PARA>

That prompted a letter from the Acting Director of the Davies Laboratory, one of the leading research institutes of the CSIRO in this country in tropical science, calling him what he was: a poser who did not on that visit even go into the laboratories and meet the people who were working there. That is the level of sincerity of the honourable member to which the scientists in the Davies Laboratory at Townsville took serious objection. It is repeated often along the front bench on the Opposition side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I came into this chamber this evening to talk about serious issues that affect the people of Australia. I have mentioned just a few items of concern to the people living in rural and provincial areas of this country. But I would like to address my remarks tonight on the Appropriation Bills to foreign policy and defence, two issues that are very near and dear to me. I want to mention two aspects that emerged from the Speech by the Governor-General on the occasion of the opening of this Thirty-sixth Parliament. The first was that the Government would continue to work actively for the promotion of international peace and to promote our alliance relationship with the United States of America (USA) under ANZUS. The second was that the 1987 White Paper would continue to guide the development of Australia's defence capabilities and the involvement of Australian industry within the policy context of greater defence self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA> These two statements are sound policy. They are consistent with our national goals and interests. Their successful implementation is fundamental to the continued security and prosperity of Australia. Ever since this nation was conceived it has always been our national goal to protect the security of Australia, its people and our democratic way of life. As a member of the community of nations Australia has fought in numerous wars for peace, freedom and progress. We have always had a powerful sense of brotherhood with those democratic nations that share our values and traditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's relationship with the United States of America is based on shared values of freedom, peace and progress. It is not simply a relationship based on our common opposition to communism and the exploitation of mankind. Our relationship is based primarily on a common moral vision shaped by our democratic institutions and cultural heritage. This alliance relationship is fundamental to the long term interests of both the United States and Australia, but more so for Australia in the short term. I find it fanciful when I hear people in recent times describe Australia as part of Asia; it never has been. Australia is a separate land mass distant from Asia and possesses a pronounced and separate identity to that of Asia. We have large oceans east and west and at present we have friendly nations to our north. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite our participation at great cost in blood and national treasure in the liberation of South East Asia and the south west Pacific during World War II, and despite our massive contribution in aid and security measures to many countries throughout South East Asia since World War II, we have never become a recognised common partner. For example, Australia is not a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations. Whilst we make a positive contribution to the peace process in Cambodia and have excellent bilateral relations with many South East Asian countries, we have a long way to go in developing perceptions in both Asians and Australians of each other's identity. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet against all this background Australia remains the richest and most advanced country in the southern hemisphere. Australia has a crucial responsibility to ensure the stability of our immediate area of strategic interest. Through the ANZUS alliance we can help to project within this region the basic conditions of security and progress that are essential for the maintenance of peace and stability. By achieving the objectives of the 1987 Defence White Paper, Australia can obtain the military capability to honour our alliance obligations. The 1987 White Paper requires as a necessary condition for defence sufficiency expenditure on defence of at least 3 per cent of gross domestic product, which is 3 per cent of $370 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1990-91 Budget presents a heaven-sent opportunity to ensure that defence expenditure is in line with the objectives of the 1987 Defence White Paper. In my view it is essential that, whilst Australia may seek to promote the rule of law and diplomatic solutions to regional conflict and whilst Australia may seek to maintain stable regional military balances to deter those powers that might seek regional dominance, it will not be successful in those endeavours if it is not militarily strong. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Government to continue as a priority with the development of a further bare base, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Scherger near Weipa, is welcome. That will complete the arc of bases, extending from Learmonth the RAAF curtain to Derby, Darwin, Tindal, Weipa and Townsville, that we as a nation may be called upon to avail ourselves of at a time of extreme pressure, maybe in the years to come. The potential for regional instability is of serious concern to the Government. If there is, as I have often spoken about in this House, to be a downgrading of American forces in Asia by as much as 10 per cent, in my view this could sharpen concerns amongst a number of Asian nations to dramatically increase defence expenditure. The Korean peninsula and the Philippines remain in a constant state of internal pressures and tensions. The withdrawal of United States forces from the Philippines would remove at one stroke one of the strongest stabilising influences in that part of the world, and the treaty upon which those bases are located in the Philippines expires next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, from an Australian perspective we must be prepared to adjust our security policies and military posture to take advantage of the possibility of dramatic changes in our strategic environment. We must do this at a time of financial austerity and regional political uncertainty. In this regard the rapid growth of Indian and Chinese naval power could lead to antagonism amongst nations of South East Asia. India's intervention in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, as well as its confrontation with Nepal, has attracted attention. India, with two aircraft carriers, will soon have the most powerful Third World fleet with the capacity to attempt control of the South East Asian straits. India now has a base on Nicobar Island, just 130 kilometres off Indonesia. Chinese naval power has been improved. In March 1988, two years ago, China fought a significant naval battle with Vietnam in the Spratly Islands. </PARA>
<PARA> Perry J. Wood, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, writing recently in the Christian Science Monitor observed:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chinese claim all the South China Sea island groups-the Spratlys, Paracels, and Natunes. These claims conflict with the claims of Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia-</PARA>
<PARA>with which we have a defence agreement-</PARA>
<PARA>the Philippines and Indonesia. The expectation of rich offshore oil deposits in this region make these claims a source of tension. </PARA>
<PARA> Japanese, Indian and Chinese naval modernisations have led the South-east Asian nations to undertake their own naval build ups. Their growing naval power, combined with old antagonisms and competition for oil and resources suggest a potentially volatile situation in South-east Asian waters. </PARA>
<PARA>That was an American perspective. It is against that background that the modernisation of Australian naval forces is of critical importance, and in my view it is essential for the Government to ensure that Australia possesses an adequate submarine force of sufficient numbers to protect our commercial maritime fleet and protect the security of sea lanes in this region. In this regard I urge the Government to exercise its option to secure two additional Collins class submarines to the six already ordered. </PARA>
<PARA> The relocation of part of the Australian naval fleet to Western Australia and the development of Australia's submarine force as a primary strike force argue for at least eight submarines in the Australian fleet. In this regard the retention of the North West Cape communications station becomes of added importance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to other matters of defence facilities and equipment referred to in these Bills. Whilst congratulating the Government for the build-up of Australia's defence capability, there are two other items of equipment which require priority attention. The first is the need for the Australian Defence Force to acquire at least four airborne early warning and control aircraft. The RAAF aircraft inventory includes the P3C Orion, and I understand that this aircraft is suitable for conversion to that role at about $50m per aircraft. Combined with the Jindalee over-the- horizon radar, the Australian Defence Force would then possess optimum radar capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The second item requiring appropriate attention is for the RAAF to retain the 11 Chinook helicopters which are at present in storage. I have previously spoken in this House on the reasons why the Chinook helicopter should be retained and my remarks on that occasion were subsequently supported by a number of authoritative sources outside this House. The Australian Defence Force needs the full complement of the 11 upgraded Chinook helicopters to provide a heavy lift helicopter capability. To have four helicopters, as is reportedly proposed by the Australian Army, in my view would be a tragic loss of a much needed heavy lift helicopter capability. </PARA>
<PARA> I have confined my remarks basically this evening to a few observations on foreign policy and defence equipment as I believe these issues are of primary concern. However, I note that the New Zealand National Party has now decided to adopt the anti-nuclear policy which in 1985 was espoused by the Lange Government which led to the collapse of ANZUS. Australia therefore is now effectively alone in the southern hemisphere in maintaining a defence treaty with the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> We in Australia have a strategic vision and a clear perception of our national goals and interests and we have the means available to achieve and protect those national goals and interests. We shall not withdraw from our responsibilities as a free and democratic nation. We in Australia have a major responsibility for ensuring the stability of our region, and as the world enters a period of new hope for peace I believe that it would be foolhardy to neglect the basic conditions of security which are necessary for the maintenance of peace. I take much pride in supporting these Bills introduced by this Government for the protection and security of Australia-economically, militarily and also for the social cohesion of our nation, Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>In recent years the sheer volume of new tax legislation has assumed such massive proportions, and has been characterised by such a high degree of complexity and convoluted drafting, that one may be forgiven for concluding that, by and large, it has served to confuse and obfuscate instead of setting out the rules with a reasonable degree of clarity and precision. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mark Leibler, tax lawyer, of Arnold Bloch Leibler and Co. said in the Australian Financial Review of 26 September 1989. Nowhere is this comment more appropriate than in regard to the capital gains tax introduced by the Hawke Labor Government. Not only has it demonstrated its incapacity to produce a tax system which can be easily understood, but Australians now suffer under more onerous tax obligations than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has repeatedly demonstrated his own confusion with regard to the economic impact of the capital gains tax by his own misleading and contradictory statements on this issue. What the Opposition has consistently argued is that Australia needs a tax system free of the complexities that the Treasurer has arbitrarily imposed. Our proposal of a speculative gains tax at a declining rate over five years not only offers Australians greater simplicity but also gives them the incentive to save and invest. Australia desperately needs a policy shift towards that which fosters and rewards individual effort. A fundamental element in the policy shift is our decision to abolish the capital gains tax and introduce a tax on speculative gains. </PARA>
<PARA> Laying aside the rhetoric, millions of hardworking Australians who in no way could be classified as rich, despite what the Treasurer would have us believe, are currently and will continue to be affected by this Government's oppressive capital gains tax. Four million superannuation policyholders, 750,000 small businessmen and women, one million small shareholders, thousands of Australian families, and beneficiaries of deceased estates: it is on behalf of these people that I speak here tonight. I refer in particular to the impact of the capital gains tax on small business and on the entrepreneurial skill of Australians, and its effect on home owners. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin by reminding the Treasurer what Australian taxpayers really think of his capital gains tax. The Taxpayers Association has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Capital gains tax is like a bad dream. Apart from the uncertainties, even what seems to be straightforward seldom is-like the bit about exempting gains on a principal residence! Our research show just about every conceivable complication can arise. </PARA>
<PARA>That was stated in the Taxpayer of 24 February 1990. I notice that yesterday the Government introduced a Taxation Laws Amendments Bill to try to tidy up some of the consequences of the capital gains tax in relation to the domestic dwelling. Difficulties in interpretation and the discriminatory nature of the capital gains tax are of widespread concern. It is no secret that the present capital gains tax works in favour of particular vested interests such as the union movement, which has been specifically excluded from the net of the capital gains tax by virtue of section 23 (f) and section 160z (8). What is the rationale for these sections? Does the Treasurer have a `capital gains accord' with the trade union movement? That is the only way I can understand how these particular sections were slipped in. As such, it reflects the Government's bias towards supporting the most unproductive and intransigent areas of the economy. Such hypocrisy from a Treasurer publicly committed to levelling the playing field is not unexpected. Poor drafting, ad hoc changes, the lack of any consistency or adherence to guiding principles or rules of law have contributed to a system where the unintended consequences of these new tax measures abound. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of these unintended consequences becomes all the more apparent when one compares the estimated and actual revenue collected by way of the capital gains tax over the last few years. In outlining the financial impact of the Income Tax Assessment (Capital Gains) Bill in 1986, the Treasurer estimated the revenue gain from introducing the tax at approximately $5m in 1987-88, rising to $25m in the fifth year of operation. The actual yield for 1987-88 was $281m. That is 5,600 per cent above the Treasurer's estimate. Looking at the Budget estimates for 1989-90, the fifth year of operation of the capital gains tax, we see revenue estimates from the capital gains tax are about $500m. This compares with an estimated $25m by the world's greatest Treasurer, an unbelievable 2,000 per cent increase on what was originally estimated at the time of the commencement of the Act. Whilst the Treasurer has justified this massive increase by reference to the removal of section 26aaa on 25 May 1988 the fact remains that his assertion that only a tiny section of the population would be affected is a complete fallacy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxpayers Association has not been alone in its condemnation of the Treasurer's capital gains tax. Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation said:</PARA>
<PARA>Taxing capital gains also discourages entrepreneurial development and the adjustment of asset portfolios which are crucial to improving Australia's productivity. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, Peter Boyle, the national director of the Australian Small Business Association said:</PARA>
<PARA>Keating's capital gains tax is like a brick wall in front of business incentive. </PARA>
<PARA>The recurring theme throughout the latter statements is the very real need to create an incentive orientated environment whereby Australia may trade its way out of its balance of payments and external debt problems. </PARA>
<PARA> For those willing to take up the challenge of business in the 1990s and compete it is essential that they be given the opportunity to do so in the knowledge that the risks undertaken will be adequately rewarded. Current tax arrangements, especially with regard to the capital gains tax, are complicated, costly and biased against productive investment and saving. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business plays a critical role in the Australian economy which is often overlooked. We cannot afford to ignore its contribution in the 1990s, nor the need to ensure its continued viability. Small businesses constitute 95 per cent of enterprises in Australia, including 105,000 farmers. That the Government's capital gains tax discourages anyone starting up a small business is beyond doubt. Any sale of a business established post September 1985 will attract capital gains tax. Existing arrangements allow only a 20 per cent exemption for goodwill in newly established businesses. The remaining 80 per cent of the proceeds of sale is taxed at the top marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Business goodwill upon the sale of an enterprise has traditionally been seen as some consolation for the hours put in by many small business men and women for risks run and the profits reinvested. Taxation such as this can only be seen as most oppressive and anti-investment. Similarly, there is a corresponding disincentive for those wishing to expand or extend their businesses. Let us suppose that through hard work a sole trader expands his business so that the current value of it is 50 per cent higher than what it was prior to September 1985. The effect of capital gains tax would be to tax that increase, 50 per cent of the business, at the top marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA> For those liquidating there are also major capital gains tax problems to be considered, especially if the business pre-dates 20 September 1985. For farmers and factory owners who have outgrown their premises or who simply wish to move on to something new, the gain on any such business must be realised. With no available roll-over provisions to encourage reinvestment elsewhere there is little incentive to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> While the bulk of all tax paid in Australia is paid by those on higher incomes or by larger companies there nevertheless remains a large number of small businesses and lower income individuals caught in the capital gains tax net. One of the significant offshoots of this, as identified in the recent report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled, Small Business in Australia-Challenges, Problems and Opportunities-a committee on which I participated-is the inevitability of a lock-in or reduction of capital mobility. Regardless of whether the assets are acquired pre-September 1985 or after that date there is a definite bias against selling. For instance, assets acquired prior to September 1985 are once only opportunities to realise tax free gains. Any reinvestment will attract capital gains tax and therefore the reinvestment will have to be that much better to make the sale worthwhile. For assets acquired after September 1985 in all such cases capital gains tax must be paid directly on the realised gain. Obviously there is a disincentive to sell. </PARA>
<PARA> As was pointed out in 1986 by the tax manager at the Macquarie Bank, Peter Fletcher, unlike income tax, capital gains tax is relatively easy to avoid. If one does not feel like paying it, one simply refrains from selling one's assets. This is exactly the sort of attitude engendered by capital gains tax, and one which will take Australia very swiftly to economic stagnation and decline. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst not all people hold this view, the longer term effects of this type of attitude are a major cause for concern, given our current economic condition. The Standing Committee was of the view that the lock-in of capital to existing small businesses resulting from the introduction in 1985 of a realisation based capital gains tax must result in a significant dampening of those very characteristics of small business-innovation, adaptability, mobility-which should be particularly highly valued in Australia's current economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that one of the major strengths of the small business sector in other economies and Australia's economy was its adaptability to respond rapidly to changes in technology, costs and market opportunities by the redeployment of both capital and human skills. The committee believed that this was a powerful argument for at least a deferral of capital gains tax where capital was being rolled over from one business to another-a recommendation that the Treasurer would do well to heed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, having talked to a number of small businessmen around Australia and having heard evidence from a great number of individuals and small business organisations, finally recommended in the area of capital gains tax:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . given the existing capital gains tax regime, capital gains tax be deferred on the capital gain realised on the sale of a trading business which is rolled over into another trading business. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee suggested in its further recommendations that capital gains tax deferral apply only to that part of the realised gain which is subsequently rolled over into another trading business. The Committee had some difficulty in the definition of what constituted a trading business-it was to be less than $1m-and it had a number of restrictions in that trading businesses were not to be considered in the areas of business dealings in shares, commodities, securities, land, futures, banking, insurance, money lending, hire purchase, financial, accounting or legal services. The Committee suggested that the roll-over should occur within one year of the sale of the previous business and that full capital gains tax be paid in the tax year when the existing business is sold unless the realised capital gain is deposited in an approved holding account until such time as reinvestment occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see from those recommendations that the Committee was agreed on the suggestion that there be a roll-over provision. However, there were considerable difficulties in the actual implementation of that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to capital gains tax and the family home, the logic of the Treasurer's argument-that the introduction of capital gains tax stemmed from his desire to create a level playing field in the field of taxation-dictates that the next move will be to extend capital gains tax to the family home. The exemption of the family home from capital gains tax has given it an artificial attraction as an investment. The result has been an inflated demand for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Young home buyers face the reality that the exclusion of the family home from the capital gains tax has dramatically increased the price of residential real estate over recent years. Whilst total investment in dwellings has increased significantly faster than the economy as a whole, record interest rates have combined to force housing prices beyond the level of average wage and salary earners-so much so that the outlook facing first home buyers is that in Sydney the facts speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year a first home buyer needed a salary of $64,000 to meet the monthly repayments on a medium priced home financed by an average home loan-that is, they needed significantly more than double average weekly earnings. Only 15 per cent of families could meet these conditions. By comparison, a first home buyer back in September 1985, at the time of the introduction of the capital gains tax, would only have need and income of $23,700-just above average weekly earnings-to meet the monthly repayments to purchase a medium priced house. Recent Housing Industry Association figures reveal that this situation has not changed significantly. In both Sydney and Melbourne the proportion of household income spent on mortgage repayments during the March quarter was unchanged at about 38 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the matter of the capital gains tax being a de facto death duty. Capital gains tax has proved a most worrying development for the elderly in the community due to the implications it has for deceased estates. Upon introducing the capital gains tax, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA> Liability . . . in the case of death will be rolled over to successors, and will only be assessed on any subsequent disposal. Therefore the CGT will not apply in the case of death. </PARA>
<PARA>This, as we all know, is totally misleading. In effect, when an asset is taken over by a beneficiary at the deceased's cost base and then prices have risen faster than the CPI, then some capital gains tax which the former owner would have incurred on a sale is a tax time bomb left with the beneficiary. Thus, where an asset has been acquired by the deceased after 19 September 1985, capital gains tax liability charged, maybe years later, to an unsuspecting beneficiary will extend back to the date the asset was acquired by the deceased. So much for the Treasurer's promise that capital gains tax affects only the rich. But, given the left wing sympathy for the reintroduction of death duties, it is little wonder they have been surreptitiously introduced in the guise of capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to speculative gains tax. By contrast, the Opposition has proposed a tax on speculative gains designed to penalise the financial cowboys and encourage long-term productive capital investment. Mr Keating's capital gains tax, as I have demonstrated, acts to discourage all manner of entrepreneurial activity in the small business sector. More particularly, it impacts severely on small business men and women, comprising 95 per cent of all enterprises in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the coalition's proposals, assets held for one year will continue to be taxed at 100 per cent of the real capital gain thereby penalising those in for a quick buck. A reduction on a sliding scale of 20 per cent a year over five years will ensure adequate rewards, on the other hand, for those who invest wisely and productively. </PARA>
<PARA> By providing incentive for people to pursue tax free medium to long term capital gains in this way savings and productive investment will be encouraged and millions of Australians will have the opportunity to get ahead. The coalition alternative aims at simplifying the taxing of capital gains to make it more equitable and cost efficient. More importantly, it will encourage individual savings and wealth creation as a means of providing for the future.</PARA>
