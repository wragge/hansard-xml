<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the cognate debate on the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I want to focus my remarks principally on the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill. The main issues which this Bill addresses include changes in patient contribution rates; the introduction of a minimum pricing policy; measures to improve efficiency and minimise inappropriate prescribing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill proposes structural reform to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), which is essential given the escalating costs to the Government and the taxpayer of providing this valuable service to the community. The cost of the PBS has doubled in the last four years and has been forecast to double again within the next three years. Those figures necessitate an urgent review of the scheme in order to ensure its survival and continuity. In keeping with the Government's commitment to both comprehensive and equitable reform the Government has successfully completed that review, to which this Bill stands testimony. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the Government successfully addressed the need for reform, but it has also honoured its social justice platform by safeguarding the poor and needy from any adverse impact which might otherwise have resulted from proposed changes. To illustrate this point I will now address the changes affecting concessional beneficiaries and, in particular, pensioners receiving the full pension benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed in this Bill that from 1 November 1990 pensioners will be required to pay an amount of $2.50 for each prescription they have completed. There is a ceiling of $150 for the period from 1 November 1990 to 31 December 1991 and then a ceiling of $130 per calendar year, which is the maximum that a recipient of benefits will be required to pay for pharmaceuticals. Once that ceiling has been reached those pensioners in need of pharmaceuticals will be able to obtain them free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Government last week announced changes to the method which would be used to reimburse pensioners for the fee they will be now required to pay. On 1 November 1990 a $50 pharmaceutical supplement will be paid as a lump sum to those receiving the maximum rate pensions. For these pensioners this payment will replace the $2.50 per week pharmaceutical pension supplement announced in the Budget, which was to be paid over the 20-week period before the general pension increase due to take effect, with the indexation of pensions, in March 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the lump sum payment, those pensioners who are chronically ill and need to have a couple of prescriptions filled each week, or more in some cases, will be able to seek further advance payments on their pension increase of up to $32.50. This process can be repeated if necessary until the ceiling of $130 is reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has introduced these changes because it is sensitive to the needs of those who require large doses of medication. We are determined to minimise any inconvenience that this group may have incurred as a result of the reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Part rate pensioners who hold a pensioner health benefit card, as well as all sickness beneficiaries and other beneficiaries aged 60 and over who hold a benefit card, will receive the $2.50 per week supplement from November 1990 to March 1991. This supplement will then become a $2.50 increase in the base pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners will not be adversely affected by this proposal. They will receive a real pension increase of $130 per year. Those who are chronically ill and genuinely require more than $130 worth of medication each year will be able to obtain additional medication for free. Further, the ceiling translates into 52 prescriptions per year. Surveys have shown that on average pensioners use 27 prescriptions in a year or less. So in actual fact many pensioners will be better off because the portion of the $130 which is not used to purchase pharmaceuticals will go directly to them to help meet their everyday living costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes proposed in this legislation are evidence that the Labor Government is committed to maintaining the living standards of pensioners and providing increases where possible. It is fair to say that we have exceeded our own promise of ensuring that pensions be above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. This year they will be significantly above that figure and some pensioners will be able to experience even greater increases because of the additional funds they will receive directly in their hands to offset the changes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> With this Bill the Hawke Government has drafted a proposal which provides savings to the public purse and at the same time is equitable to ensure the continuity of the service through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to that segment of the community which generally needs it most, that is, the aged, the frail and the needy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is forecast that these changes regarding pensioner charges will result in real savings for the taxpayer of $185.3m by 1993-94. That saving takes into account the additional cost to the social security budget of increasing pensions to directly offset the proposed charges for pharmaceuticals. That is tangible but fair reform, but the benefits of the changes will not stop at that point. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been increasing concern amongst health care professionals about the misuse of pharmaceuticals amongst the elderly and the tendency by doctors to overprescribe. The charge of $2.50 will go a long way towards addressing the propensity to stockpile medicines for a rainy day simply because they are free. The Government is effectively encouraging pensioners to consider more closely the type of treatment a particular doctor is using, as well as preventing people from shopping around from doctor to doctor and collecting armfuls of scripts as they go. </PARA>
<PARA> I was recently discussing the issue of overprescribing with my local general practitioner. He quite rightly pointed out that the majority of doctors and patients harbour the mentality that we need a pill to cure the ill, so to speak. I think it is fair to say that patients tend to believe that they have only received satisfactory treatment when they leave the surgery with a prescription. This places doctors in a very difficult situation because a medical practice effectively operates like any other business and unless the demands of the market are met the practice ceases to operate effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> My general practitioner indicated to me that he had the opportunity in his surgery to hear the sales pitch of representatives from something like four drug companies in any one day. All of this goes to show, as he pointed out to me, that the sort of medical advice that general practitioners provide should relate to altering one's lifestyle with a more healthy diet, exercise and things of that nature rather than reliance on a prescription sort of mentality that has so often pervaded the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth saying that one would hope that the changes announced in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will contribute in a tangible way to doctors rethinking a lot of the ethos that has gone on in medical practices. These changes are particularly designed to ensure that in the future the whole community is more questioning and critical of the way doctors go about conducting their consultations so that they will move away from the script-led medical mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> In some cases relatives of the elderly can attest to years of hoarding and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals in bathroom cupboards. This is obviously a dangerous phenomenon because pharmaceuticals go out of date and more often than not it is forgotten what the drug was actually intended for. Such a situation is hazardous and, far from achieving its original purpose, can actually be responsible for creating ill health. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there are also financial penalties attached to such waste. The Australian taxpayer has to pay for those drugs that are wasted as well as those that are used to make people better. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme costs the taxpayers more than $1 billion per year so we really should be looking at ways to minimise wastage. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make some remarks about the changes to the general patient category which now require people to pay a sum of $15 for each prescription. It is fair to say that the increase, which is aimed at ensuring that those people who have a greater capacity to pay do so, is one that could not be argued with in this House. I make it clear that people in this category who are chronically ill and who require large numbers of prescriptions will not be adversely affected. The general patient category also includes provision of a safety net in the form of a ceiling which guarantees that the maximum outlay in a calendar year will not exceed $300. Once this ceiling has been reached, patients will be entitled to pharmaceuticals at the cost of $2.50 until the sum of $50 has been spent, after which they will be entitled to their prescriptions free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in this Bill will not adversely affect the disadvantaged and the needy. The Government has safeguarded them in the calendar year safety net arrangement that has been established. Most people who view this issue objectively would say that that is a fair and reason-able change to make. At the same time the Government is effectively reforming the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by containing the cost of providing the service. This amendment will result in savings to the Government to the tune of $245m in one calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the minimum pricing policy. This amendment also proposes to reduce the financial burden of the PBS on a taxpayer through the introduction of a minimum pricing policy. This will mean that where there are lower priced alternatives for a particular drug available on the PBS, the level of government subsidy will be based on the price of the lowest price brand. If the patient elects to receive the dearer brand, the difference will be met by the patient, including pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries who will pay the $2.50 concessional contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy in no way limits the amount of drugs available under the PBS, and all drugs, whether they will be cheaper or more expensive, are subject to the same strict quality control. At present there exists a wide range of drugs available on the PBS which will be fully subsidised by the Government. There are 700 generic drugs listed which are able to treat nearly all the diseases and conditions, even those that use chemotherapy as a part of their treatment.</PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is practical and commendable because it will encourage medical practitioners to prescribe those drugs which will be the least financial strain on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. At the same time one would hope that it encourages doctors in their prescription habits to be conscious of their obligations in this area. The proposal of a minimum pricing policy will also have a positive effect in the development of the pharmaceutical industry by encouraging the development of a locally based generic drug manufacturing industry. Market demands will provide financial incentives for an Australian pharmaceuticals manufacturer to start production and in doing so bring about increased employment, hopefully export growth, and technological improvements and advances. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of drug companies are based in my electorate. I trust that they will avail themselves of this opportunity, rather than relying, as they have tended to do in recent times, on their multi-national conglomerate partners to provide much of the actual industry, and simply reverting to being a dispensing arm for those international operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The third element of change contained in the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill which will further enhance the reforms of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is dealt with in clause 9 of the Bill. The amendment will implement part of the agreement reached earlier this year between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild on pharmacy restructuring. This part of the agreement relates to a new level of pharmacy remuneration for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions. The provisions of the Bill effect the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires that this Tribunal give effect to agreements reached between the Government and any organisation representing the majority of pharmacists. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is further required to terminate an inquiry it may be conducting into pharmacy remuneration if such an agreement is in force. Most importantly, however, this clause removes the need for the Tribunal to hold inquiries while the agreement is in force. I would point out that it was a determination of the Tribunal on 28 August 1989, following an inquiry into pharmaceutical remuneration, which began the dispute between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild.</PARA>
<PARA> The changes that are outlined in this particular legislation will provide a more practical forum for resolving many of those differences. I congratulate the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) on his efforts towards resolving fairly and reasonably and for the benefit of the whole nation what was for all those involved a difficult and trying period. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the deeming provisions outlined in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). There are a number of issues that should be discussed. The changes relating to the deeming provisions of pensioners' incomes have caused some anxiety in the community. This concern is understandable, but unnecessary and ill-informed. The new arrangements will not significantly affect the vast majority of pensioners. Indeed, it can justifiably be said that banks have taken unfair advantage of pensioners for many years. The ethos of pensioners putting money in interest-free cheque accounts or low-interest savings accounts in order to minimise their yearly income and therefore maximise their pension payments has been a great windfall for the banks. Unfortunately, the net effect of this process has often meant that the interest earning opportunities of pensioners has been lost. They have organised their financial arrangements in a way which makes them worse off, increased the cost to the Government, and left the banks smiling smugly at customers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA> The new arrangements, in my view, are fair and direct incentives to pensioners to make sound financial investment decisions. A key element of the Government's changes in this area is the expanded financial information advisory service within the Department of Social Security. It will play a very important role in the future. Based on my knowledge of this service, which has one of its branches operating in my electorate, the departmental officers are doing an excellent job explaining and detailing the difficult concepts about which many pensioners are seeking advice. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in stark contrast to the role that many members of the Opposition have played in unnecessarily frightening and creating anxiety for many in the pensioner community in what can only be described as a calculated campaign of misinformation about the actual effect of the deeming provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The deeming provisions in almost all circumstances can be organised in such a way that the pensioner is no worse off. It is certainly fair to say that in the vast majority of cases pensioners can organise their affairs, if they have some other money sitting in accounts, in a way that makes them better off. What we have is the combined effect of additional interest-earning income capacity and lesser reductions in the pension for income earned over the threshold limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Many pensioners have money sitting around in an account that does not earn any interest in the mistaken belief that, if it does not earn any interest, they will protect their main target of keeping fringe benefits and those sorts of things. The banks have been able to take advantage of that and take the pensioners for a ride; the pensioners have been disadvantaged through that process because their income earning capacity would have been far greater than the effect on their pensions of the way they were organising their financial areas. The net result is that the only ones who have won out of that process have been the banks. I think they have a lot to answer for in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding my address, I would like to point out that through this Bill the Government is honouring its commitment to equitable and sustainable reform while ensuring that those groups in society who are most vulnerable are safeguarded from adverse effects. The broad objective is to ensure better health outcomes through more appropriate targeting of government subsidies while at the same time preserving all the essential features of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Government has met its commitment to provide a universal program which guarantees access to essential medications for those most in need while maintaining an equitable funding base through the taxation system. For these reasons, I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I would like to sum up this debate in a number of ways and address a number of the issues that were raised by honourable members. I appreciate the support of the Opposition for the Social Welfare Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill and the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and its recognition that in these areas of social programs-whether it be in income support or services such as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme-we constantly have to make changes to them to adjust to the forces in the economy as well as to the changing patterns of our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People generally do not like changes, but the problem with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, as people are becoming more and more aware, is that at its current rate of growth it would become an untenable scheme that no government could sustain it in a way that would enable it to provide the essential health services and protection that it should. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in its overall operation, though, is the role of the pharmacist, and a very important role that is, both as a delivery agent and as an advice agent to people in the handling of their medications. In that regard, the Government is involved with pharmacists and pays pharmacists remuneration on a prescription basis for dispensing those pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions. The process we have to go through at the moment is before the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal (PBRT). That body was set up in 1981 by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) when he was Minister for Health. The Bill was introduced by the then Government because of problems in the relationship between pharmacy and government at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are dealing with issues of money, particularly on the scale of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, then one way or another I think we are destined always to be involved in that situation. The Tribunal was established to take the matter out of what was then solely a bargaining position, and that led to many frictions, of which the honourable member for Warringah would be only too well aware. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that one of the flavours of the debate on this Bill is the apparent disposition of the Opposition to attack the independence of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, and to attack it only in this House. We do not see the same venomous attacks on its independence outside this House. The shadow Minister talks about the PBRT `punishing' pharmacy. He says that he would prefer an independent tribunal, that `very few people would regard the PBRT as fair and objective' and that it is carrying on a `vendetta against pharmacy'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very strong statements which, considering the formation of the PBRT, headed by a Deputy Commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission and having as members other people appointed very much for their expertise, should not be made lightly. If claims are made questioning integrity, they should be properly based and backed up with facts. But that has never been the case, and I doubt that it ever will be-either inside or outside this House. If honourable members want to come in and question the integrity of the PBRT, then they should have the guts to say what they are questioning and provide the facts, and basically lay their charges in a substantive way against particular people, not just slur everyone. There are five members of the PBRT: Mr Justice Riordan, Deputy Commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission; Mr McAuley; Professor Richardson; Ms O'Brien; and Mr Miller, who himself has been a practising pharmacist. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we have to get away from that approach. It is really either put up or shut up. I have made that challenge before, but it has never been answered, and I think it does behove the Opposition, if it is to be taken credibly on this issue, to actually put forward any details and make substantive claims-and not in here, in what is often called coward's castle, because of the protection of the Parliament. It should make its claims in a way which can be properly answered. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem for the honourable member for Warringah is that he did not seem to be able to grasp the difference between how the PBRT will operate under the new clause in the Bill and how it operates now or how remuneration was determined when he was Minister prior to the formation of the PBRT. The story goes around that, as part of his discussions at one time on pharmacy remuneration, he was in a room with pharmacists and the remuneration was worked out on the back of an airline ticket or something like that. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment to the Act basically gives the opportunity, if there can be coincidence of views between the Government and a major pharmacy body such as the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, to reach agreement, and that should then be taken effectively as a consent agreement, as it is in many other issues of industrial relations. If that is not the case, then either party, or both parties for that matter, obviously would have the power to continue, and the Tribunal would have the authority to continue, to go through the processes in the way in which it has been conducting its business on behalf of pharmacy and government since 1981. So what we have is an expansion, if you like, of the opportunity to improve the relationship and the remuneration process between pharmacy and government. I appreciate that the Opposition is supporting the Bill. I think that, in the end, it will certainly be for the betterment of the whole system. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise another matter referred to by a number of honourable members, in particular the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), and that is the concern that people living in nursing homes would have seven-eighths of their $2.50 a week pharmaceutical supplement taken away because their care and accommodation payment or fee was in fact related to their income. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day after the Budget was introduced I wrote to every nursing home explaining that this addition to the pension would be quarantined. I have made numerous statements about it between then and when Senator Walters and others commented about it, suggesting that people could lose those benefits. It is inappropriate, when people are dealing with the most vulnerable and frail members of society, with the knowledge that this will not happen, to persist in raising the issue. It is inappropriate and in no way sensitive or becoming of anyone to go down that path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I have not made a determination in relation to that, because it is not yet in effect. The point is that people living in nursing homes and hostels will have that part of their pension quarantined, because it is there specif-ically as a supplement or compensation to cover the cost of a prescription. I hope once and for all scaremongering statements by persons in the community or in this House will cease, because it does not help those affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as generics are concerned, I appreciate the comments that were made by honourable members, some more than others. I am pleased that overall there is agreement with the principle that the role of generics should be expanded in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I understand why the shadow Minister might castigate the Government for not introducing generic substitution. He fails to recognise the importance of factor F, in terms of prices for the pharmaceutical companies and the development of the pharmaceut-ical industry. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) pointed out that there is an opportunity for the broader role of generics in the whole process to lead to expansion of the pharmaceutical industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, a number of honourable members are not aware of what a generic is. I noted that the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), in his-should I call it a contribution-speech, talked about a patent life of 16 years, and in his usual manner berated anyone who happened to be in sight. The patent life was extended from 16 to 20 years some time ago. It has been a while since the honourable member was shadow Minister for health, so I would not have expected him to have picked up on that. But he says things so forcefully and with such venom that one expects him to be clear on his facts. He was also confused when he spoke of the concept of a generic being a different generation drug, as I read his speech. He was talking about beta-blockers and comparing them with ace inhibiters, suggesting in some way or another-and I do not know how the logic would work -that the Government would not allow people to have ace inhibiters when what he thought was a generic of an ace inhibiter would be a beta-blocker. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the present shadow Minister, the honourable member for Lowe, being both shadow Minister for health and a doctor in his own right-and I understand once a respected one; he is concerned about his decline in respectability, but I shall not comment further on that-will have a talk with the honourable member for O'Connor, if he can bear to do so, and explain to him what a generic is and tell him about generic policy. We might then get a more sane contribution in the future from the honourable member for O'Connor, if that is possible, on this type of matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Other concerns were raised about overcharging by pharmacists. Certainly, we have to be aware of that and I think the consumer has the right to know what is going on. A number of instances have been reported to my office and the Department in recent weeks of pharmacists charging up to $15 for medications and trying to charge pensioners $2.50 when they do not have to pay anything at this stage. Instances of this sort bring disrepute on the industry and, in fact, it has led President elect of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and Acting National President, Mr Colin Johns, to issue a directive to his members on the matter of overcharging. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Guild has received consistent and disturbing reports of a small number of pharmacists allegedly overcharging for PBS prescriptions, since the Budget announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Guild cannot condone activities reported such as charging $15 for Indocid capsules and $2.50 for pensioner prescription items prior to November 1. Although such charges may be able to be justified in the minds of some pharmacists it can only result in Government pursuing legislation to the detriment of all. </PARA>
<PARA> During a period of sensitive negotiations, issues such as this will only serve to strengthen Government resolve to maintain a hard line. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that members of this House and pharmacists will take note of that directive from the Acting National President of the Pharmacy Guild because it is an issue of serious concern and a burden which the community should not have to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> The use of pharmaceuticals is an issue which really underlies the cause of certain health problems in Australia. The Government believes-and I am sure that all Opposition members appreciate and understand this as well-that these measures will help to develop a far healthier population which will use medications more appropriately. I certainly agree with the Opposition that the medical profession has a very important role to play in this area-one which it has not taken squarely on its shoulders at this stage. When I talk to different organisations in the medical profession about overprescribing and inappropriate prescribing of drugs there seems to be a great reluctance to accept any responsibility-in fact, to accept much responsibility for working with government to deal with the issue. That sort of head in the sand attitude is not acceptable. I appreciate that the Opposition shares this sentiment, and I think we have to look at this matter because it should not be the sole responsibility of government, consumers or pharmacists to deal with these issues. Too many people end up in hospital every year because of the wrong use of drugs and inappropriate prescribing. Apart from the cost to the community, the fact that about 20,000 people end up in hospital every year because of these sorts of problems is a sad indictment of many aspects of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems that we are hoping to overcome, and which I am sure we will overcome due to the developments that have come through in this legislation, concerns the practice of hoarding. Many people, for various reasons-obviously human nature being one of them-tend, if something is free or particularly if they feel any insecurity for some reason or another, to hoard medications. We get a lot of health problems as well as wastage as a result of this practice. I illustrate this point with the example of a cupboard in a person's home which was cleaned out by a relative who found drugs to the value of $2,450. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was many years' supply of drugs-it was almost a pharmacy! In some cases six to nine year's supply of different drugs have been found. This occurs simply because of unnecessary hoarding or squirreling, as one might call it. One way or another, it is a tremendous amount of wastage and constitutes a tremendous health risk to that person's health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In another example, again of an annual clean-out of cupboards, a writer's surviving 91-year-old relative had 77 unopened bottles and pill packets although it had been only 12 months since the cupboard had been previously cleaned out. In addition to those sorts of problems, one came through on the hotline where a person obviously was very distressed because she had a large number of medications. A departmental doctor said that a large number of them were effectively the same drug under different names being used and administered daily-so she was getting multiple doses of the same drug under different names-and there were a number of drugs that had contraindications and would cause complications when other drugs were taken with them. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of health issues such as these need to be addressed. I believe that the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme under this Bill will do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Turning to the Treasury vote, in the area of tax administration, outlays of the Treasury are to increase from $769.227m in 1989-90, to an estimated $963.247m in 1990-91. These outlays reflect the collection costs that have resulted from increasingly complex taxation laws under this Government. Treasury itself has acknowledged that Australian tax law is in need of simplification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, $2.079m has been allocated this year to taxation policy. Buried somewhere in this subprogram is the Government's tax law simplification unit vote, that unit having been established in only February this year. As any businessman would be able to tell you, Mr Deputy Chairman, there has been precious little tax law simplification under this Government. Indeed, the reverse is very much the truth. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the widely acknowledged and urgent need for tax law simplification in Australia and the role of tax laws in contributing to tax collection costs, I should have hoped that Treasury would see sense and, as a matter of priority, get on with the job of reforming and simplifying our tax system. Instead, we find only a few lines in the explanatory notes discussing both the 1989-90 outcome and the 1990-91 outlook for tax law simplification. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Treasury portfolio and vote are not immune from the pork-barrelling efforts of the Government. At page 31 of the explanatory notes for the Treasury portfolio, there is proposed expenditure of $17,000 for the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations and $20,000 for the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation for representation on the Government's fraudulent price watch network. Identical amounts were spent last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The price watch network has been exposed as nothing but a propaganda exercise for the Government. It does nothing to alter high rates of inflation for which this Government is directly responsible. Amongst its other activities, it seeks to attach blame to others, namely, the people who sell goods and who are subject to this rather indefinable oversight by the price watch network. In seeking to attach blame to others for the effects of inflation, it matches the present little diversionary tactic of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in trying to blame the banks for the results of his fiscal and monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 130 we find the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which the Government has used to make secret payments to favoured Labor States above and beyond those formally provided for as a result of the Premiers Conference. These payments include $12m to South Australia for water treatment projects, $40m to Tasmania for public sector restructuring, and $20m to Western Australia for transport improvement. These outlays take the form of capital grants rather than recurrent grants, so that they will not be taken into account by the Commonwealth Grants Commission when it comes to formulating the distribution of payments to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> These payments were kept secret and designed to circumvent the requirements of fair dealing at the recent Premiers Conference and to limit parliamentary scrutiny of this expenditure. The exposure of these grants by the shadow Minister for finance, my colleague Senator Short, has also demonstrated the hollow rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his so-called federalism initiative. No non-Labor State can ever again take this Government's commitments at face value. This Government is fostering distrust between the States and the Commonwealth to the detriment of a healthy federal system. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning briefly to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, I draw the attention of the House to a number of consultancies employed by Prime Minister and Cabinet and detailed in its annual report for 1989-90. A number of these consultants seem to have been engaged in advising the staff of Prime Minister and Cabinet on a variety of health issues, including, no doubt, the pressing health problem of colds and flu. On page 228 of the annual report we find that several thousand dollars has been allocated in the past to stress management workshops, stress awareness programs, cold and flu avoidance information sessions and the like. Again, it is nice to think that the Prime Minister and Cabinet staff are being kept healthy, but I would have thought that an individual's health was very much his own responsibility and not something that the taxpayer should be slugged for and hardly something that should be in the vote for Prime Minister and Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> There are thousands of Australian firms in the private sector that I am sure would like to be in a position to cater similarly to the health needs of their employees, but of course they do not have the bottomless pit of taxpayers' funds that the Government has. But they are afforded no such luxury, in the economic circumstances forced upon this country by this Government and the bureaucrats who administer its policy programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has the unfortunate role under this Government of giving effect to special interest group strategies. It is on the basis of these efforts that the Government invariably seeks re-election. These strategies, I put it to you, Mr Chairman, have no purpose other than to buy off selected interest groups through government handouts at the expense of taxpayers. The principal offenders are the Office of Multicultural Affairs and the Office of the Status of Women and their respective programs, the so-called national agendas on multiculturalism and women. Prime Minister and Cabinet is also the home of the Social Justice Secretariat, which administers the Government's social justice strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of interest group buy-offs has been the same year after year, but it is getting worse, if anything. Narrowly based groups which claim to represent particular interests in the community receive grants for a variety of nefarious projects which have been well publicised-special surfboards designed for women, nonsense projects, a complete waste of government money. In many cases, the grants are for small amounts but they mount up to many dollars indeed. Worse than that, such grants set a bad example to the community at large and bring governments and parliaments into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> These groups are also granted positions on various government committees, for which they are often paid sitting fees and costs, and receive consulting work for projects which are, to say the least, of dubious value. More often than not, these groups have no greater merit or entitlement to these moneys than a well-developed talent for milking the system. I suppose it is likely and can be said that Prime Minister and Cabinet is charged with ensuring that there is the appearance of good works being done in these areas while keeping the individuals and the interest groups appeased with government largesse. I would have liked to have gone on to another matter, but I see that the clock is about to beat me, so I will leave it there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said in my speech on the Appropriation Bill that one of Australia's main problems for the transition to the next century was to achieve an economic growth rate more in keeping with the performance of this region's part of the world economy. I note that the Treasury's first economic policy objective is `to achieve sustainable economic growth'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What causes rapid economic growth? In the 30 years that I have studied economic growth, the debate among theoretical and policy economists has gone through a number of fashions. In part, this has reflected the reality of which economies were actually growing most quickly at the time of the controversy. Around 1960, it seemed the case that Soviet-style economies were capable of mounting rapid economic growth through directive regimes. By 1970, the stagnation of the Soviet bloc was more apparent and western European economies took over the running of fashion. Market economies with strong state sectors and indicative planning seemed to be the way to go for rapid economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The turbulence of the world commodity markets in the 1970s resulted in a new fashion for the 1980s. The east Asian economies led by Japan have proven to be flexible adaptors to changing economic conditions and we started to talk about the east Asian edge. By the late 1980s, Japan had been joined by other good performers in east Asia and Professor Garnaut now talks about the east Asian ascendancy. </PARA>
<PARA> A further result of these changes in growth rates, exacerbated by the currency realignments in the mid-1980s, has been for historians and strategists to debate what causes the rise and fall of different countries, a debate that is centred in the United States and has led to Paul Kennedy's book on the subject becoming a best-seller. As a result, we have a lot of literature on what causes rapid economic growth and what differentiates different rates of economic growth in different countries. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the literature tell us? In the first instance, it points out that when we talk about Third World economies, a prerequisite to economic development and growth is political stability and administrative efficiency. It then goes on to talk about certain cultural norms of industry and hard work. Most of these we can assume to be present in Australia already. </PARA>
<PARA> The literature then wobbles off in two general directions. It talks, on the one hand, about the need for appropriate factor shares between labour, capital and the public sector, sector shares involving a considerable amount of government intervention. It also talks then about the desirability of market forces setting the allocation of labour, capital and other productive resources. In other words, there remains the old tension between the appropriate mix of market and plan. But injected into the debate, quite appropriately, has been to look at the east Asian economies that have been so successful to see what differentiates them and see why they have been able to do it. I will itemise a couple of these before returning to our Budget and the Treasury's role in it. </PARA>
<PARA> These east Asian economies have had, first, high savings ratios, which have enabled high investment ratios and then the export of capital; their labour forces have had a low factor share of gross domestic product (GDP) and earnings related to productivity rather than industrial muscle; foreign markets have been afforded priority for goods; state consumption, including military expenditure, has been, generally speaking, low, but state direction of macro-economic activity has been unusually high, in not only Japan but also South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and other well-performed economies. </PARA>
<PARA> How can these factors better our understanding of the appropriate role of Treasury in the setting of Budget factors on a year to year basis? In the first place it is quite clear that our factor shares had gone badly astray during the 1970s when, it must be pointed out, both sides of this House had a share in managing the economy. Our wages share had gone to historically high levels and the government share of consumption had risen. Investment levels, particularly if we took out the mineral sector, had gone to a very low level and, far from plugging into the international economy, our economy had actually moved closer to autarchy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers reveal that at the aggregative level the Treasury has been successful in correcting to a considerable degree these imbalances. First, the Government share of GDP has been reduced from a peak of 30 per cent to a projected 23.5 per cent. To the extent that this reflects a reduction in consumption by government, it will contribute to a high growth profile. There are a few real dangers which come into this. If it prevents the maintenance of an appropriate public sector infrastructure of capital, this trend would actually in the longer term establish a constraint on sustainable growth-which is one of the reasons we on this side of the House need to have a debate about it over the next couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The other danger is that the erosion of social programs which has been involved in the cutting of government expenditures could result in a reduction of social programs for citizens requiring assistance due to difficulties beyond their control. We try to avoid this by appropriate means and assets testing of benefit programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government sector has moved into effective surplus which has further reduced present consumption claims on savings and has actually contributed to the savings ratio improving. Thirdly, capital and labour have also increased their contributions to the savings ratio in some measure due to the Government's intervention in the shape of the accord. The profit share in the business sector, which collapsed in 1975 and again in 1980, has been restored to something around its late 1960s levels and the labour share has been restored to a similar level, having exploded during the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I point out that a theoretical economist would say that a restoration of these factor shares, in the way that is described in the Budget Papers and which I have referred to, would lead to a surge in economic growth, and that has taken place. We can see it in the measurement of labour participation rates, jobs available, economic growth sector by sector and in GDP as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> During the last year this surge of economic growth has been somewhat constrained by government action on tight monetary policy because the growth rate that occurred saw the growth of demand exceed the growth of output and as a result there was a flood of imports which has led to an unsustainable growth rate in international debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to go back to the theoreticians I talked about at the beginning of this speech. What would they say we should do in order to correct the external imbalance? Firstly, we could argue for autarchy which would take us back to the dirigisme of the generation of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s which has created the problems that we are now trying to correct. Secondly, we could kill off domestic demand to such an effective extent that it would stop the import surge but effectively kill the economy as a whole. Thirdly, we could stick with our present policies which have the aggregative factor share settings correctly placed, which would see a reduction in the external deficit of about one per cent per annum, reducing over a couple of years to 2.5 per cent of GDP per annum which is an acceptable and sustainable level. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-this is what I would like to conclude on-we can take a slightly different option and say that the factor shares have now been put in correct proportion, we have corrected the imbalances that developed during the 1970s and early 1980s and we are now in a position to undertake a high growth rate in the economy of the kind more consistent with that of our neighbouring economies. </PARA>
<PARA> We might say that this will produce State intervention of a level that the Treasury is inclined to oppose, but it does so for very understandable reasons. When it was undertaken in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s it eventually established a system of economic development in this country which led to our having a low growth rate. However, such intervention is quite consistent not only with the practice of the fastest growing economies in the world, to be found to our near north, but it is also being practised in Australia in those key areas of labour-capital shares through the accord; in telecommunications, air travel and other infrastructure policies which will be confirmed over the next couple of weeks as a result of the debates within the Labor Party; in labour training policies so successfully pursued by the Minister concerned; and in the restoration of our savings ratio by intervention in national superannuation policies which will yield hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in Australian industry over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to accelerate the restoration of rapid economic growth with an external balance we need to work on intervention on a sector by sector basis. I will be returning to these sectors in later debates. Let me just flag four that I think could be usefully approached. Firstly, there needs to be considerable discussion about the appropriate mix of policies to produce an effective and efficient infrastructure to maintain economic growth in this country and the level of ownership and regulation that is appropriate for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we need to again attack the problem of technological innovation because the management and investment companies program that was certainly well intended did not produce the intended results. Thirdly, we need to think about strategically exporting secondary industries in line with but not totally in accord with the Australian Manufacturing Council's Global Challenge publication which came out last month. Finally, we need to move into increasing the rate of value added projects to be found in the resources sector. So we have infrastructure, technological innovation, secondary industry policies and the resources sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to speak briefly in this committee stage on the Department of Finance and a few brief matters regarding asset sales because there are some questions that have been raised which have not been answered by the Government that stem from the Budget. On page 3.375 of the Budget Papers there is an overview of the proposed asset sales. Asset sales are something that the Opposition agrees should take place, and we have supported the principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there are two matters that have come to notice that I think are deserving of the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Free) in reporting back to this chamber. The first one relates to the sale of the Sydney-Moomba gas pipeline as it relates to the agreement with the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL). It is quite clear that there are now major legal doubts about what the Government is proposing. It would be appropriate for the Parliamentary Secretary to come back to this place and make clear exactly what is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of this matter is long and detailed. In summary, this is the second time in a Budget-the previous Budget dealt with it-it has come forward as being proposed for sale and there have been public advertisements that there is to be legislation brought to this place which we will consider in due course and make a decision on. The gas haulage rates that will be charged by the Pipeline Authority, which is now 100 per cent government owned, are to be increased by 50 per cent. That will transfer into about a 5.5 per cent price increase for commercial users and about a 1.5 per cent increase for domestic users. It is not an insignificant amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this legislation coming forward is the interesting point. If we go back in time we see that the original proposal to sell the pipeline was made on the basis that AGL, which has the carriage contract, was not able to proceed to buy the pipeline. Now there is a legal dispute as to whether it does have a legal right to purchase the pipeline. The Government is apparently saying that it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The trouble with selling the pipeline is that AGL has a supply contract to the year 2006. That is fixed to return to the Authority only the costs of operation and finance. If it is sold the buyer must finance its cost at commercial rates and convince AGL that it needs a new higher cost contract. The alternative was for the Government to legislate to repudiate the contract with AGL, a private company. That is the nub of the issue. It is intending to repudiate the contract. If it does the question of compensation then becomes quite important. Based on information that has been given to me, the prospect of compensation could run up to $600m based on the payout cost of the new haulage rates that this legislation is proposing. That would totally negate the benefit to the Commonwealth of the sale of the pipeline. Therein lies a real dilemma for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is even worse than that because I understand that there has been conflicting legal advice, firstly by the Pipeline Authority to the Australian Government Solicitor and, secondly, by the assets task force to the Australian Government Solicitor. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has become involved and I understand he has communicated either verbally or in writing-he does not send me copies of his letters-with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) expressing concern about what is taking place with regard to this proposed asset sale because of the implications on compensation to the revenue of the Commonwealth if a successful compensation claim does proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter was raised at the Australian Labor Party (ALP) Caucus meeting on Tuesday. The Attorney-General did respond, but not in any detail, I understand. I think it is time for the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) to give this place a full account of exactly what is happening and what are the respective rights of the parties. The people of Newcastle in particular, and New South Wales generally, want to know what is going to happen to that pipeline and what effect there might be on prices. It is quite clear that there is an unholy mess at present and until it is sorted out there will continue to be great uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole program of asset sales-and we have seen about $3 billion of asset sales take place over a period-will now be put under a cloud and under question. I think that would be regrettable. I am not in possession of all the facts; so I will be charitable and ask the Minister to put forward exactly what is happening and to make any comments about the abilities or otherwise of the asset sales task force. To my mind, the task force has achieved quite remarkable results, having regard to the very limited scope that it has been given. I certainly think that this is a political problem for the Government which has great potential legal ramifications for AGL in terms of the compensation that might be claimable. I raise that matter with the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, who is at the table. I could not be speaking to a more appropriate person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He cannot even type, but in any event he can carry back the message that there are many people who want an answer on this matter. I have talked with many of the employees of the Pipeline Authority. Many of my colleagues and I have had representations from AGL. It really is a matter for the Government to state exactly what the position is as this continued silence is just not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I wanted to raise-and I do not want to delay the Committee-relates to another major asset sale concerning the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC). This also falls into the same category as that of the pipeline in that this is the second time that there has been an attempted sale. The last sale plan was not successful. There were six bidders and all of them withdrew prior to taking up the option to acquire HLIC, which is a 100 per cent government owned housing loans mortgage insurer. Interestingly, it holds 50 to 55 per cent of the market for mortgage insurance so it is a very significant entity. It should be sold, in my view-there is no doubt about that-but there are some problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, the Minister has not put down a statement or made clear exactly what is happening. We can only rely on media statements. In my view, when we are talking about such substantial amounts of money which are detailed in the Budget Papers, that, in itself, is not satisfactory. There has previously been an unfortunate leak about some of the negotiations with regard to the HLIC, involving the Australian Federal Police. I understand that matter has been resolved. Certainly the commercial sensitivity in dealing with these matters needs to be paramount in everyone's mind, be they employees, the HLIC, members of the asset sales task force or members of the Government. What we are concerned about is returning to the Commonwealth the very best price that can be achieved in the marketplace from the sale of assets. That is the point that I am concerned about, based on the report that has now become available. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that there is great division. Now is not the time to canvass the whole issue of privatisation, although if anyone attempts to interject I will be tempted to launch forth yet again in support of privatisation. Certainly the ALP has had some confusion and some doubts about these two particular asset sales. A Caucus committee recommended that the HLIC not be sold and that it was worth keeping in government ownership. Cabinet has persisted with the proposal that it be sold. The problem is that it is now hard to find a buyer. Therefore, it has proposed an alternative. The Minister for Finance has indicated that the Government will not be selling it unless it can achieve at least $50m by way of proceeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Now there is a proposal on the table, at least publicly, which I ask the Minister to respond to and the Secretary at the table to elicit a response, about the possibility of the option of the total wind-up of the HLIC which, based on its reserves and on an independent report given to the assets sales task force by the John Trowbridge consulting firm, may possibly return $37m to $59m, depending on assumptions relating to future claim experience by way of reserves which could be returnable to the Commonwealth. We need a response to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that if one is going to have a winding-up of a mortgage insurer, the level of claims that may be outstanding has to be taken into account. They have to be paid for out of the proceeds of the winding-up-that is, the moneys that will flow to Consolidated Revenue-and all claims under existing policies will have to be met. The nature of mortgage housing insurance is such that it is long term; some loans have terms of 30, 35 or 40 years. We need an answer and we need one quickly. The liability question is not resolved, and that is a contingent liability to the Government --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to one item covered by the Treasury estimates, that is, the Industry Commission. The amount allocated to this Commission is synonymous with the amount of money which is being spent by government in maintaining bodies and inquiries. The estimates provide $12.16m this year for the operation of the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission is a direct linear descendant of the Tariff Board and its successor, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), bodies which I think have contributed to problems in Australian industry and to decisions which have been made by governments and in this Parliament over a considerable period of years and which have not necessarily been in the best interests of Australian industry. Twelve million dollars would have been well spent if at the end of the day the Industry Commission had contributed to the evolvement and the betterment of the operating circumstances of Australian based industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I declare an electoral interest. Three major industries are in my electorate. The Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd is, and has been for many years, almost totally dependent for its continued operations on decisions which are made by governments and this Parliament. Alcoa of Australia Ltd does not have the same degree of direct interest; nevertheless it has a direct interest, and the wool textile industries have a long history in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, the Industry Commission brought down a report on a number of welfare measures. I am not really sure why it should be getting into that area. It probably cost $300,000 or $400,000 to prepare. It appears to me to say in summary that we could save government expenditure if we did not provide hearing aids to pensioners. That is a totally true statement, but it does not cost $200,000 or $300,000 to arrive at such a realisation. It does not suggest-other than saying what private enterprise prefers-how people could afford this item which is essential for their day-to-day lives. It merely says that we could save money, that it is someone else's problem. If we cut out pensions, we could save a lot of money. But is anyone seriously going to suggest that this Parliament take that type of step as a savings option?</PARA>
<PARA> That typifies the problems that have existed since the days of the Tariff Board and the IAC and which obviously have not disappeared under the present body. The Tariff Board's reports were rarely adopted by governments. In fact, some of them bore so little relevance to the reality of life in Australia and the reality of political life and decision making that they were counterproductive. The reactions to reports which were obviously unable to be implemented were so great that decisions were made which in the long term disadvantaged the industries which were supposed to be assisted. </PARA>
<PARA> Those honourable members whose memories are long enough-and there might not be any in the chamber at the moment-will remember the enormous levels of tariff assistance provided to the metal industry in the 1950s and 1960s. That tariff assistance was way above any requirement. It made the cost of imports prohibitive and rendered irrelevant the need for Australian industry to compete in those industries. Most honourable members will remember that in the same period similar problems discouraged investment and modernisation in our textile industries. At that time the most successful textile operator in my electorate was Godfrey Hirst Carpets, and it still is. In 1967 Mr McKendrick purchased Godfrey Hirst Woollen Mills and literally took all the machinery down to the tip. The mill would never have re-opened again had Mr McKendrick not taken it over. </PARA>
<PARA> The levels of protection were a reaction to the fact that the Tariff Board of the day did not do its job properly. It made recommendations which were totally unacceptable at a political or community level and created reactions which resulted in over-reactions. The worst examples were the McEwen car plans sponsored by the then Leader of the Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister, Sir John McEwen. Because of those plans, in 1990 we are still trying to get the car industry on a competitive footing. In the short term the McEwen plans were very good. Unfortunately, they were inflexible and, ultimately, unable to change with the changing requirements of the Australian community for smaller vehicles that did not fit into the context of those plans. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1970s the Industries Assistance Commission was established and it brought down a series of reports. At the moment I have a question on the Notice Paper dealing with the Industries Assistance Commission, but in the meantime I would like to know how many of those reports were actually implemented-in part or in full-significantly in line with the recommendations contained in the reports. I believe that on all the major issues those reports were rejected by the Government of the day, of whatever political persuasion. The point I make is that, because the reports contained recommendations that proved to be irrelevant to reality, they resulted in long-term damage to our industry. They certainly did not assist in modernising industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Industry Commission operates on the basis on which the Treasury historically has operated, and continues to make the sorts of recommendations made by its predecessor, then it will be the dead hand on Australian industry. The guiding philosophy seems to be: `You can save money if you don't do it'. There are some things that governments have to do. There are some things that deal with human need. One of those is that people, if they are to maintain their living standards and contribute to the country in which they live, need to work and earn in order to participate properly in society. The reports that I have read of the Tariff Board, the Industries Assistance Commission and the Industry Commission always suggest how we can modernise and shed labour, but rarely how we can make our industries more competitive and more relevant. I believe that over a long period these bodies have done material damage to the industrial base of Australia. They have been out of touch with reality. They have adopted an academic approach, rather than considering the realities faced by Australian industry. I question whether we should be spending $12m if we are not to receive tangible and effective results in return. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the Committee further. The clock beat me on the last occasion on which I spoke and there is an important point I want to make in regard to the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. That is, if the Government winds up the Corporation, then it will be called upon to reach into Consolidated Revenue for some 35 to 40 years to meet outstanding liabilities. Also, it is understood that in Victoria the rising liability factor is increasing dramatically because of the falling property prices. I think that that aspect ought to be taken into account as well. If it is happening in Victoria, it is happening elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be ironic if the Government went down the path of winding up the corporation, only for some future government to find that the benefits that were supposedly going to accrue to Consolidated Revenue from the winding up were dissipated in meeting future liabilities. The Government should look at this matter far more carefully. It is ironic also that if two of these asset sales end up in the mess that I fear may occur, it will call into question the competence of the administration of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). It is important that as soon as possible the Treasurer should respond in detail about both of these matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the committee stage of this debate to address my remarks specifically to that part of schedule 3 which provides for an advance to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). My specific purpose is to mention the proposed sale by the Government of the Pipeline Authority. I am inspired to do this by the earlier comments of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who spoke at some length about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Pipeline Authority has its headquarters in my electorate, in my home town of Young. The future of those people who work for the Pipeline Authority is, of course, of utmost concern to me and to the people of the Young district. The point to be made in all of these discussions about the sale of the Pipeline Authority is that no honourable member on either side of the chamber disagrees with the decision to sell. We disagree about the proposed method of sale. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which the Government is proposing to sell the Pipeline Authority draws into question some of the basic ethics of this Government. The Pipeline Authority was set up under a contractual arrangement between itself, as the haulier of the gas from the Moomba gas fields to the Sydney distribution point and to a couple of spur lines along the way, and the company AGL-Australian Gas Light Company-which is the ultimate customer of the gas that is hauled by the Pipeline Authority. That contract was set up on a 30-year basis. The arrangements between the Pipeline Authority and the Australian Gas Light Company have operated within the letter of that contract.</PARA>
<PARA> Now, of course, the Government, in its attempt to sell the Pipeline Authority, proposes to break that contractual arrangement and to introduce through legislation in this place two price increases for the hauling of that gas from Moomba to Sydney. The first increase, to take place on 1 January 1991, will be 25 per cent. The second increase of an additional 25 per cent will follow 12 months later. There is no reason for this increase, other than to attempt to increase the value of the asset that the Government is trying to sell.</PARA>
<PARA> In times past the Government has shown no interest in increasing the price for the hauling of gas between Moomba and Sydney until such time as it has actually tried to sell the asset. In the process of selling the asset, it has said, `Hey, this is a great idea. Why don't we put up the income for the Pipeline Authority by 50 per cent? Won't we get a higher sale price when we go to sell it? This is a terrific idea. Let's do it'. The Government has done it. In the process it has breached normal business and commercial ethics. It has done so by breaking the contractual arrangements between the Pipeline Authority, which is effectively the Government, and the Australian Gas Light Company, the customer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few months, following a disastrous round of business failures, there has been a great deal of discussion in the community about business ethics. Indeed, many would say there has been a lack of business ethics in Australia over the last few years. The Government has had its fair share to say about the lack of business ethics. In the last few weeks I have heard many members on the Government benches talk about the disgraceful lack of ethics within the business and commercial community. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst they have been saying that, they are engaged in exactly the same activity through the proposed method of sale of the Pipeline Authority. In effect, the Government will be breaching contractual arrangements which are the very basis upon which the Pipeline Authority and its customer, the Australian Gas Light Company, have operated for many years in the past, and would have operated for many years into the future. That is a straight-out breach of normal commercial business ethics and I think the Government should see it in that light. The Government should be ashamed for what it proposes to do, and honourable members on both sides of the House should be asking of the Minister for Finance how it is that the Government can go down this path when we have so many examples in the business community of the great cost and great problems that can be created by breaching normal business and commercial ethics. That is the first aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect is that the Government is not really going down the path of privatisation in the proposed sale of the Pipeline Authority. I know that the Government is billing it as yet another example of its embracing of the philosophy of privatisation, but in effect it is not. The real philosophy of privatisation would see an organisation such as this being offered for sale, shares being floated on the market and, prior to or simultaneously with those shares being offered on the market, a proportion of the shares offered being made available to the staff of the Authority on some preferred arrangement for those staff to take a financial interest in the company for which they work and on which their future greatly depends. That is what privatisation is all about-giving employees a share of the business they work for. That is not what is being done in the case of the Government's proposed sale of the Pipeline Authority. What the Government is doing is simply having an assets sale. It is not going down the proper path of privatisation to ensure that the maximum benefit can be achieved, not just by the workers but indeed by the community of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are things which cause us a great deal of concern. I think the staff of the Pipeline Authority are quite right in expressing concern about the manner in which the Pipeline Authority is being sold. I think they have a right to have at least an opportunity to purchase shares in the company they work for and I think the Australian people have a right to expect that members of the Government, the people who set the standards throughout the community, should live up to normal commercial and business standards that are imposed on and expected of the rest of the business community. We cannot expect business to stick up for decent standards when the Government itself will not adhere to them in its own operations. This is something that very much concerns all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that causes us some concern is the fact that, in the first place, the Pipeline Authority was never meant to be a pipeline authority owned by the Government as a statutory authority. Originally, the pipeline was to be built from Moomba to Sydney by the Australian Gas Light Company. However, the late Rex Connor, a Minister in the Whitlam era, stepped in and said, `We can't have a private company building a pipeline like this. The Commonwealth must do it. The Commonwealth must own it and the Commonwealth must operate it'. It was some years ago in the early seventies when the then Liberal-Country Party conservative Government was in power in New South Wales that Rex Connor went down to Sydney and told the then Minister for Minerals and Energy that the State Government would not be allowed to let AGL build that pipeline; it would be built by the Commonwealth. So from the very first instance this is a creation of the Labor Party, particularly a creation of the late Rex Connor, and it seems extraordinary that the Government should be going about disposing of this asset in the manner in which it is proposing, particularly in the light of the fact that it comes from the very heartland of Labor's philosophy so many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> None of us now disagrees with the fact that it should be sold. What we disagree with is the manner in which it should be sold. I am pleased to note that the Minister for Finance has entered the chamber because I will be interested to hear what he has to say about the legal consequences of the Government's proposal to breach the contractual arrangements between the Pipeline Authority and the Australian Gas Light Company. I believe that those breaches are reprehensible. It is a disgrace. It is something that sets a bad example right throughout the business community and, indeed, the broader community at large. It is something that this Government should not be doing and, in the process of doing it, I think it brings a great deal of disgrace and shame upon the shoulders of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe also that the staff and employees of the Pipeline Authority, who have shown great expertise and diligence in their task, have a right in the sale of this asset to have a proportion of the shares offered to them for purchase as individual employees. I know from talking to them that many of them would be interested in this. It would give them a great sense of belonging to the organisation. It would provide them with considerable incentive to perform better and it would also provide them with an ongoing interest in a company which is terribly important to the future of Australia. I will be interested to hear the response from the Minister for Finance to my remarks and to those of the honourable member for Bass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to some of the remarks that have been made in the course of this debate by the two Opposition speakers. The two issues that have been raised relate to the asset sales of the Pipeline Authority and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (HLIC).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dealing first with the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the allegation has been that we have had trouble finding a buyer and that we are now looking at the possibility of a wind-up. I say, firstly, that that is not the situation. What is being looked at-and interest has been sought from a number of possible purchasers on this basis-is a buyer who would acquire the HLIC's goodwill, the new business rights, the physical assets and the staff obligations, and who would contract to manage on the Commonwealth's behalf claims made in respect of the HLIC's existing stock of residential and commercial insurance policies for a period of five years-the major period in which the underwriting risk normally occurs is the first five years of a loan-after which time the buyer would resume the residual risk. </PARA>
<PARA> On this basis, we believe that there is much more likelihood of a satisfactory sale being arranged than the previous straight-out sale basis. The purchase price, I believe, on that basis will be a substantial one and one which should be satisfactory to the Commonwealth, but at this stage I am not able to give any further information. The expressions of interest that were sought on this basis had to be in with the Commonwealth Task Force on Asset Sales by Friday of last week. A report is coming to me from that task force in the near future on what that process has thrown up, and I will be able to provide the House with more information at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Pipeline Authority, the proposal which has been announced involves the breaking of the current arrangements in relation to the price at which gas is charged. The basis for doing that is that the current arrangements do not provide the Commonwealth with any return-that is any profit-on its investment. It is simply a straight-out cost recovery exercise, which in our view is a fairly unsatisfactory basis upon which such an enterprise should operate. It effectively means that there is considerable subsidy to the gas consumers of New South Wales, and a more satisfactory basis of operation, with or without a sale, would be one where the gas was sold at its true economic price, which would include some return on the investment in the pipeline.  That is the fundamental thinking on it at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, if it were to be sold on the current arrangement without any change in the haulage rates and the return to the owner, we would get a very poor price for the asset-an exceedingly poor price-particularly compared with replacement value, which is well over $1 billion. We would be handing over a very valuable asset for a very small price because the new owner would be locked into a very poor return basis-depending on what the purchase price was from the Commonwealth-until the year 2006, and thereafter with not much improvement for some years. </PARA>
<PARA> The only really satisfactory basis for sale is to put the pipeline on the economic basis on which it should properly have been put in the first place. That provides the new owner with an enterprise which will provide a reasonable return on the investment. It will also be a monopoly, of course, and our concern is to ensure that there are restrictions on the prices that the monopoly gas haulage company could charge. In the public announcements made about the new basis of sale, the Opposition will have noticed that there is reference to two possible pricing formulae or processes, which would provide some limitations on the degree to which prices could be increased in future after the two 25 per cent increases that have been foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> To break the current arrangements cannot be done lightly, and is not done lightly; it is a serious matter. The Opposition has properly made the point that it is not a minor matter but a serious step to take; it is not something that is being done lightly. It is a step for which we believe there is absolute legal authority; that is, it is not an illegal process. That does not mean that there will not be some High Court or legal challenge-there probably will be-and certainly the people obviously talking to the Opposition probably told it that that is what they were going to do. They certainly told the Government that they are likely to undertake a legal challenge. Our strong advice is that the Commonwealth is quite well placed to meet any such legal challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the moral aspect, which in some ways is more important, because it is not easy, and should not be done lightly by a government, to break an arrangement which it properly entered into and which the other parties to the arrangement could have a reasonable expectation in normal circumstances would be seen through by the Government. The reason for making that change is simply the one I have already enunciated-that is, it makes absolute nonsense of a sale, supported by the Opposition and included in its list of asset sales at the last election, to sell it with the current contractual arrangements, because one would get peanuts for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, if it was to be sold for some substantial price, we would have to be looking at some beneficent owner who was going to make losses or have no return upon their investment for many years. Obviously, we are not going to get a buyer on that basis. So the only satisfactory basis for sale is to put the pipeline on a proper economic basis in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it could be said that this should have been done in previous years, and I accept that it would have been better had it been done in previous years. It was not done when it was first set up under the then Labor Government; it was not changed by the Fraser Government. The recent rearrangements ensured that there was cost recovery. Prior to that we were not even getting cost recovery. So we at least moved to that degree. But it is now clear that the pipeline should have been put on a proper economic basis. We now propose that that be done. </PARA>
<PARA> To do that, legislation will have to be brought into this House, and I propose that to be brought in probably in the next two week period of the Parliament sitting. There will then be an opportunity for the Opposition to further consider its position. But I expect and hope that the Opposition will support this. As I say, the Opposition thinks it should be done. If there is going to be a sale of the pipeline, it can only be sold in a rational way on the basis which the Commonwealth proposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there has been a considerable amount of lobbying by interested parties and a lot of wild allegations being put around about the degree to which compensation might be due. The advice to me is that the amount of $600m, referred to by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith)-I have also seen that figure from the same source, I am sure-is, in our view, a massive and gross overestimate. No figure of that kind is in vogue. If anything like that figure was to be a possibility, it would certainly be cause to reconsider the whole process of sale. Clearly, we will be going ahead on the basis that little in the way of compensation of that kind will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Opposition spokesman to the fact that part of the arrangement is that the enterprise is required to pass on in full the increased haulage costs. On that basis, therefore, there should not be a great deal of compensation since the costs will be fully passed on. The only basis can be that, presumably, there would then be a possibility of some loss of business in some areas. Of course, that may or may not eventuate and is something we can discuss at a later date. At this stage, I can assure the House that we are not looking, in our view, at the likelihood of losses remotely of the kind of extraordinary figures being alleged by interested parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable members who have participated in this debate at the committee stage on proposed items of expenditure for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Finance and Department of the Treasury. I also thank the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) for coming into the chamber and attending to two matters that were raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I respond to some matters raised by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). He expressed some concern about progress on tax law simplification. This is a matter that the Department is pursuing as important and has, therefore, devoted the appropriate resources as referred to in the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I add that, certainly from a consumer's point of view, a great deal has been achieved already by the Australian Taxation Office in the area of simplification. In recent times we have had the introduction of self-assessment, which has certainly made it easier for ordinary taxpayers, and this year the introduction of the tax pack, which I think honourable members would agree has been an outstanding success. It is a very useful step by step guide to completing a tax return. The task is not exactly one we all look forward to with great enthusiasm each year, but certainly for me, and I am sure for others, the job has been much easier this year because of the tax pack. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin went on to accuse the Government of pork barrelling a number of organisations-in particular, consumer organisations and the Australian Pensioners Federation. He also made some criticism of its involvement in the Government members' national price watch network project. I simply make the comment that the price watch network has been a very effective organisation. Those Government members involved in it have worked very hard in the interests of consumers and have succeeded in making available to ordinary people in towns and cities across the country important information on where they might be able to save a bit here and there on their weekly grocery bills. I am surprised that the honourable member for Curtin finds this kind of activity reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> The price watch project is also a very cost-effective activity. It is assisted very largely by voluntary labour and also by some part-time clerical support provided through the Government Caucus committee secretariat. The Government Caucus committee secretariat is a secretarial unit located in this place which provides support services to the Government's backbench committees. There are also some part-time staff assisting the price watch effort. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make the point that this organisation was established by the Fraser Government to support in those years the Liberal and National parties' back bench committees. The Labor Party inherited this organisation when it came to Government and decided that it was important that secretarial support be provided to Government back bench committees. We agreed with Prime Minister Fraser and his Government that this was important, and so we took it over. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and well before then. The honourable member for Curtin also attempted to make something of alleged secret payments to the States. I make the obvious point that payments which appear in the Budget Papers can hardly be described as great secrets, particularly as the honourable member for Curtin was able to come across those figures without too much difficulty. Such payments are part of the normal process in dealings between the Commonwealth and the States in the lead up to the Loan Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That a majority of the States of Australia have Labor governments is a fact of which honourable members on this side of the House are proud. Though the honourable member for Curtin may disagree with it, it is a fact and an inescapable part of intergovernmental dealings that dealings between State and Federal governments these days tend to be between Labor governments. In passing, I should say that if the honourable member for Curtin finds these payments so objectionable, he might like to make it known in the media in his home State that he appears to oppose assistance to Western Australia for those transport projects to which he referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member spoke also of some consultancies operating within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concerning the health of employees working in various offices within the Department. That work is important. It yields to the employer important dividends. Obviously, by having a healthy work force, absenteeism is reduced and greater output and efficiency achieved. It is my understanding that similar projects are becoming popular in the private sector as well because private employers recognise that a healthy and fit work force makes for a better enterprise. Increasingly private employers are getting involved in health promotion among their employees. The programs seem to be working extremely well in Canberra, judging by the number of joggers I see on the streets at lunchtime and at other times of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Curtin mentioned also the existence within the Department of various units that he described as catering to the needs of specific interest groups. He referred specifically to the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the Office of the Status of Women and the Social Justice Secretariat. There are other organisations within the Department of which he would be well aware but to which he did not refer. For example, I mention the Office of the Chief Scientist. The location of those offices within the Department is a reflection of the importance that the Government attaches to activities in those various fields. Often the objectives that are being pursued assist groups and individuals who perhaps do not have the prominence that they deserve in other areas of Government activity and in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> It was with a rather wry smile that I listened to the honourable member for Curtin refer to various nefarious projects that had been funded from year to year. It is a source of some satisfaction that he had to go back many years to find a particular project to which he needed to refer. This is old stuff from the Opposition; this is old Waste Watch Committee rhetoric, the kind of shallow stuff the Opposition went on with some years ago when it went through the annual list of research grants and selected research projects with titles that might be described as rather esoteric. That is a fairly easy exercise for anyone to do. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Waste Watch Committee was carrying out that exercise it was interesting to hear one of the Opposition's own members, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), when speaking on a report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, demand that the Government allow institutions greater autonomy and not attempt to interfere at all with the direction of research. If one can rely on the Opposition for one thing from time to time, it is a degree of inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank also for their contributions the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). I know they would want me to express on their behalf their gratitude to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) for providing such a prompt response to the two matters they raised, concerning gas pipelines and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.

It is about time that the various regulatory agencies, both State and Commonwealth, made sure that those corporate laws that do exist are enforced. We note with some regret that it has taken the Government some time to come to this position. The Australian Labor Party has been in office since 1983, for seven years. Its interest in regulation of companies and securities legislation has been demonstrated by a pattern of disinterest, inactivity and complacency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes the apparent determination of the Government now to come to grips with this matter. It should be noted, however, that in the course of that sorry pattern of failure in the past, when the Government finally got around to improving corporate regulation it ran straight into the Commonwealth versus the States argument. That has tied up legislation in this House and in the High Court and has meant that for about 18 months there has been an Australian Securities Commission with no regulations to enforce and a National Companies and Securities Commission which has been running out of staff and running out of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Attorney and suggest that in order to clean up the present mess in relation to companies and securities regulation, he should produce legislation as early as possible in this Parliament. Draft legislation has been around for some time. Almost every day one opens a newspaper to find that a new report has come out about how things ought to be improved. The only place one does not see any reports or any action is in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation that regulates companies and securities law is one of the most important, complex and technical pieces of legislation to come before us. It will take time for the community to digest it, it will take time to have soundings and it will take time to have debate. I appeal to the Attorney-General to introduce that legislation as soon as possible so that there can be time allowed for the taking of views and for sensible debate so that we get it right-and let us hope that this time we will get it right. I have said in this House before, and I say again, that the Australian Securities Commission-the one regulatory authority-will be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I have listened with great interest, in the context of the companies and securities regulation issue, to many of the new members of parliament who have been making maiden speeches over the last week and to others from the government side of the House who have repeatedly criticised bad company practice over recent years. For my part, I would say that there has been much to criticise. There has been a lot of bad company practice. But I suggest that those honourable members who are critical of some of those people who have now fallen from grace in the financial sense should look at the record of their own party leaders-I know that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) will be interested in doing this-to see exactly where the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer stood on the issue whilst those who have now fallen from grace were still in favour. </PARA>
<PARA> I did this exercise very quickly and came up with an article from the Australian of 14 November 1987, entitled `A day in the life of a PM: from suburbia to millionaires' row'. The article told how, on this particular day, the Prime Minister had gone to Mount Druitt-which was very comforting to know-and had then caught a helicopter across Sydney Harbour to receive Alan Bond's gift to the nation of a $12m replica of Captain Cook's barque, Endeavour. I do not know whether that vessel has been completed, but I hope it has. The report then stated that the Prime Minister had lavish words of praise for Australian businessmen. Before a live audience on The Midday Show the Prime Minister described Mr Bond as `one of the most outstanding exports from pommy land'. He said that he wanted to repudiate the idea that Labor was not a party which had close links with big business. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be a condemnation of our society if we did not recognise the enormous contributions of the Alan Bonds and other great entrepreneurial risk-takers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one thing to get up in this Parliament now and criticise the entrepreneurs for their excesses, but whilst the excesses were being indulged in, the Prime Minister of this country was involved, as much as anybody else, in congratulating those excesses. If one wants to know why there was a failure in relation to corporate activity, one should look at the attitude that was being taken by the Federal Government throughout that period. Now that some of those people are being criticised, principally because they have fallen from grace, at least the Government seems to be determined to do something about corporate activity and regulation.</PARA>
<PARA> According to Budget Paper No. 1, there will be an increase in operating expenditure as from January 1991 of approximately $41m per year over and above what was being spent jointly by both the States and the Commonwealth. Although the expenditure in relation to the Australian Securities Commission will be $108m in the year to 30 June 1991, a large portion of that amount appears to comprise set-up costs. The Attorney-General might be able to inform us how much of that cost will constitute set-up costs and, indeed, how that cost adds to the set-up costs already incurred in relation to the Australian Securities Commission over the year to June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, this is not a zero sum gain for the Commonwealth Government because even though it is increasing expenditure in relation to the Australian Securities Commission and companies legislation it is opening up a new source of finance. As from 1 January 1991 it will take over the revenue that was formerly collected by State corporate affairs commissions. On a full year basis it appears that that revenue will be $210m. Of that $210m, the first $110m will go straight back to the States-not for corporate regulation, not for investigation of bad practice, but for general revenue. In other words, companies will pay their regulation fees and the Commonwealth will pay the first $110m back to the States to be spent as they see fit. Apparently that sum will be indexed in perpetuity. The Attorney-General might confirm whether that is, in fact, the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the balance of spending, which will be a little over $100m, is not the full amount which will be raised from the system. The revenue raised from the system will not go to regulate companies. Nearly half of it will be creamed off to go back to the States. I think that the money that will be raised from corporate registration fees ought to be used to regulate corporate activity. If more money is raised than is spent, there are two alternative courses of action-either to spend a little bit more money to make sure that we clean up the corporate scene or to cut company registration fees. As it is, honest companies not only will pay for dishonest companies to be policed, but will pay the States so that the States can cover general revenue items with money which they ought to be raising from their own coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said in this House that companies have had enormous tax breaks in recent years. Companies not only pay income tax, but also training levies, payroll taxes, workers' compensation taxes, sales taxes and a lot of other taxes. This is another tax. If the Government were really serious about cleaning up corporate Australia it would make sure either that the full amount of company registration fees is spent on corporate regulation or, if that is not needed, that that money be returned rather than disguised in this revenue and expenditure proposal as a hidden tax on companies in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a matter relating to the rights of individuals in our society and the serious problem which is growing with the adoption in Australia of the American type of litigation system. I note from the Budget Papers that a sum of $3.4m has been allocated for reimbursement of legal fees under the legal aid system. I think we are reaching a stage where litigation has become so much a part of daily life for persons involved in corporate, professional and other public activities that it can, as it has in the United States, create a stranglehold on persons in these professions who are engaged in these activities. They will have to spend more time examining the possibilities of litigation than they do whilst carrying out the work for which they are trained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently an extensive article appeared in the Melbourne Age concerning the difficulties that were being experienced in attracting medical practitioners to the field of obstetrics. The reason given for those difficulties was the extremely high level of litigation against medical practitioners, which has been growing for some years, relating to the birth of children and subsequent problems with a child. The article indicated that the annual insurance that had to be paid by medical practitioners in this field was something in excess of three times that which is normally paid by members of the medical profession. An obstetrician was often confronted with malpractice or carelessness charges which may or may not have had real substance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the corporate areas litigation has become probably the most profitable single section of business in Australia. Corporate lawyers are probably taking more out of our industries than taxpayers or anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I give a simple example. Some years ago-and I am not sure whether the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who is at the table, was the Minister at the time-there were proposals to grant additional television and radio licences throughout Australia. In Western Australia an additional television licence was granted. Representatives of the commercial licence holders managed to prevent that station from going to air for over a year with a series of court manoeuvres, extremely expensive to all parties concerned, but not so expensive for the persons taking the legal action that they did not engender a profit because of the additional revenue share they had from the advertising market whilst the competitor was kept off the air. It took a year from the time of a decision on that licence until the station was actually able to start transmitting-not because of any technical problems or because the licence had been improperly considered but because the courts were able to be used, quite improperly, as a commercial vehicle to generate a situation where the competitor was eliminated from the marketplace for a substantial period to the profit of the litigants. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise one other area which is also of concern, and that is the question of legal aid. The cost of any extensive litigation extends well beyond the capacity of most Australians. Probably 70 per cent of Australians could not afford to spend their day in court, which in this day and age probably means a couple of years waiting and then about a week in court if it is a serious case. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite one case without locating the persons concerned, or even acknowledging the State, because I think that would be unfair. A gentleman was charged-he may not have been a gentleman-with the murder of his wife. During the trial it was found that certain of the evidence for the prosecution was in fact contrived. The case was dismissed. The gentleman was left to sell his home to pay his legal costs because he had been, apparently, improperly charged. That is quite wrong. He could not get legal aid because he owned a house. He was found to have been improperly tried because of actions of the authorities, but he was not entitled to costs against the Crown and not entitled to recoup the cost of those improper legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> My biggest concern-and I suppose it goes with the general malaise that is occurring in the corporate area at the moment-is the ranking given to legal fees in distribution after a corporate collapse. In some instances-and it would be unfair to mention organisations-the litigation which has taken place-and I place it in the past tense-has involved some of the major corporate collapses in Australia in recent times. The previous speaker has mentioned a few. They will have run into millions of dollars of legal costs and legal fees. In almost all of these cases the purpose has been to protect in some way or other a major operator in the organisation that has failed. Persons who have small investments in voting shares and stand to lose the majority of their savings, find that what they may acquire in the final wind-up of an organisation is reduced significantly because of costs incurred, not to their benefit but to the benefit or the perceived benefit of one or two large operators in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently a parliamentary committee is examining shareholders' rights and some of the disclosures at public hearings have been quite significant. In general principle there needs to be some examination of how far litigation can go and how the 70 or 80 per cent of Australians who do not have access to unlimited, and possibly other people's, funds can protect themselves or be protected. At the moment legal aid literally does not apply and the cost of litigation is beyond the capacity, as I say, of something like 75 per cent of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to two aspects of the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 in relation to schedule 3 and the Attorney-General's Department. The first relates to the Trade Practices Commission and the second to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC). The Trade Practices Commission has been voted running costs of $10m and other service costs of $2.5m. This is an increase of $400,000 on the previous year, of which $100,000 is dedicated to closer economic relations and $300,000 to waterfront reform. This is a rather small amount that has been added to the vote of the Trade Practices Commission, particularly when we look at the huge changes that are mooted by the Government in the area of telecommunications, airlines and banking, to mention a few. The waterfront alone is a major area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In our policy outlined in the run-up to the election, we indicated that we would dedicate another eight to ten positions to the Trade Practices Commission so that it would be in a proper position to handle the program of privatisation and micro-economic reform that we clearly set forward in our policy. I am disappointed that the Government has hamstrung the principal area in which its competitive policy will be prosecuted and judged. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald Ross Gittins said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Cinderella on the micro-reform agenda has been the Trade Practices Commission. If we want genuine competition, the TPC must have appropriate powers, appropriate resources, appropriate determination and the appropriate support from public opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very telling words in relation to the Government's approach to the Trade Practices Commission. It is worth also drawing to the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) the last report of the Trade Practices Commission. In that the commissioners revealed that resources are so tight that blatant breaches of the Act are going uninvestigated. The response to that has been to increase the vote by $400,000, an insufficient amount for the Government's plans, if it can make up its mind and eventually determine what its privatisation policy is in these areas. It is a disappointing response and I regret that it probably reflects the attitude of the Government towards competition, which is the most important aspect of any privatisation program. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area that I would like to draw attention to is the funding of the Australian Securities Commission. As the Attorney-General is aware, the ASC has been one of those ongoing sagas that he inherited from Mr Lionel Bowen, whose attempts to negotiate with the States and to push legislation through Parliament against constitutional advice was not one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. He lost the court case, could not get the States to agree and had the business community offside. </PARA>
<PARA> While he was doing all this he gave the securities to the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), a lousy $2m to $3m a year, which the States duplicated, and nothing happened. There was no law reform, no money, no support from the retiring Attorney-General and a general bucketing from a section-by no means all-of the business community which could not get its way with the Commission. That section of the business community did not like Mr Bosch and what he was doing so it formed a Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to support the Attorney-General of the time in forcing through this extraordinary process, which completely hamstrung corporate reform in Australia for three years. </PARA>
<PARA> This incredible position has developed and there is now largesse everywhere. Arising from this Budget over the next four years $210m will go towards the Australian Securities Commission. Once the ASC is fully operational, its budget will be $41m a year. The best former Attorney-General Bowen could muster up in his last year in office was $3.3m. On this matter, honourable members opposite have travelled the road to Damascus. When some of the Labor Party backbenchers beat their breast about corporate crooks in Australia, they should examine their Party's record in this matter. By way of example, the $3m that the Government last voted the NCSC is less than the Government voted the Alligator River Region Research Institute or the ACT Action Bus Service. That is some record of priority in corporate law in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to what has been going on in relation to the establishment of the ASC. The Advisory Committee that was established to help prosecute this new invention was voted last year $200,000. This year I notice in the Budget Papers that committee has been allocated $470,000. It must be a very adventurous committee. Meanwhile, the other two subsidiary committees, the Companies and Securities Law Reform Committee and the Companies Auditors Liquidators Disciplinary Board, have been voted nothing. Do I assume, therefore, that the Advisory Committee is going to allocate some of its $500,000 odd and therefore enhance the power of Mr Burrows and his group or are these other committees to be purely advisory and occasionally get a white car trip from the airport to Parliament House to see the Attorney-General? What are we to assume from those situations?</PARA>
<PARA> On top of that, I am always mindful of the importance of integrity in these areas. I have seen a fair bit of company law in my time and I know a bit about what goes on and the importance of company law in this area. There are two matters that I want to draw to the attention of the Attorney-General. One is the question of Mr Vrisakis, who was a member of the Advisory Committee which strongly advised for a national takeover. In fact it advised the Government that Australia must have such a commission. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time of Mr Vrisakis's appointment to the committee Mr Bowen was advised that he was on the board of Bond industries. In defence, Mr Bowen took certain action which was recorded in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 September 1990. The then Attorney-General sent a letter to the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Vrisakis made the point that he did nothing wrong...and that his personal responsibility for the financial accounts of Rothwells had been satisfactorily explained in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is at odds with the report by Mr Malcolm McCusker, QC. Despite the fact that Mr Vrisakis stood down from his position on the Attorney-General's Advisory Committee, that does not reflect well on some of the aspects of the presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to draw to the attention of the Attorney-General is that I do not believe, never have believed, and I will find it very difficult to believe in the future that the Chairman of the Australian Securities Commission should retain a partnership in a leading law firm and hold shares. That puts him at major odds with many matters that he would have to deal with. I urge the AttorneyGeneral to examine that matter because it places the Chairman in an invidious position. It was a position that was not taken by a former chairman of the NCSC. I am citing here Mr Masel, who was in a parallel position when he quit those particular associations. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to seeing what comes next. I have read in the papers that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee has 49 pages of amendments coming up to company law. I understand that no doubt a lot of hard work has been done. But what we do not want is a whole heap more black-letter law. What we do want is for the law enforcement agency to enforce the law. It is not more law-it is enforcement of the current law-that is needed in these aspects. When I first came to this Parliament, the Income Tax Assessment Act was 600 pages thick. The last time I looked it had 1,800 pages. That does not mean to say that we have better taxation law; it means that the writing of the law involves, inevitably, more loopholes. Inevitably, 49 more pages will produce more loopholes. Unless we prosecute and take someone to task in these areas, we will miss the bus. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I quote from the Bank of America's code of ethics:</PARA>
<PARA> Personal integrity is a quality of character which cannot be created or preserved by written rules alone. Rules, like laws, at best are guideposts which can serve as benchmarks of minimal behaviour. They are no substitute for a spirit--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will start with the final contribution by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) because I think I can deal more quickly with the matters raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), which were a bit more constructive. I want to reply particularly to a couple of matters raised by the honourable member for Ryan. One relates to his reference to the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) as an ongoing saga. I can vouch for the fact that certainly since March it has occupied a great deal of everyone's time on this side of the House, particularly mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member then moved on to a couple of matters which require me to answer specifically. One was a rather cheap shot at the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. He referred to the fact that $470,000 was allocated to the Advisory Committee and asked whether that would be used for-I think he used these words-an occasional white car trip to see the Attorney-General. It is worth making the point-obviously the honourable member for Ryan is not aware of this-that in fact members of the Advisory Committee are entitled to receive a sitting fee as payment for their services. None of them take that sitting fee. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point he made, and one on which he does not have to lecture or convince me, was that legislation will not bring about a totally new culture in thinking and that people's ethics cannot just be controlled by legislation. I point out that the members of the Advisory Committee are all extremely busy in their own professional areas and I would have thought that, rather than being the butt of what I considered to be an unnecessary, cheap shot, they deserve to be commended for being prepared to give their time, without payment, to advise the Attorney-General and the Government on matters. </PARA>

However, the point I am making is that the members of that Committee are doing a job in advising in this difficult area and are not at this stage taking, and have not to date taken, any payment to which they are entitled. Whether that will be the case forever, I am not sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan also raised the matter of Mr Vrisakis. Again, I think there is probably some misunderstanding as I assume that the honourable member was referring to the McCusker report which was tabled recently in the Western Australian Parliament. It is worth noting that, following the publication of that report and in light of the findings of that report, Mr Vrisakis elected to stand aside from his position as a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee and as Chairman of the legal subcommittee. That action was taken in accordance with the well-established principle that holders of public office should, in appropriate circumstances, consider standing aside from their position while issues of concern are resolved, in order to preserve the stature and integrity of the position they hold; I suppose that was the honourable member for Ryan's final point. I therefore consider that Mr Vrisakis's decision to stand aside was entirely proper and demonstrated his commitment to the important role of the Advisory Committee and legal subcommittee. But, of course, one cannot draw any adverse conclusion whatsoever from the fact that Mr Vrisakis took the decision to stand aside. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ryan raised the issue of Mr Vrisakis's original appointment and others in relation to Mr McCusker at a date further back. The original appointments to the Advisory Committee and the legal subcommittee were made by the highly regarded former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, on the basis of the standing of Mr Vrisakis in the business community. Moreover, before that appointment was made, assurances were sought by the Attorney as to the propriety of Mr Vrisakis's conduct-this is the specific point the honourable member raised-on the board of Rothwells. Generally, his financial and taxation affairs were completely in order. At that time-this is the crucial point that the honourable member for Ryan adverted to-Mr McCusker made no adverse findings concerning Mr Vrisakis's involvement in Rothwells. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue of Mr Vrisakis's appointment was also raised with Senator Tate at a Senate Estimates committee hearing in October 1989. Subsequently, Mr Bowen advised the Committee of the action that was taken prior to the appointments. Mr Bowen also took up the matter with Mr McCusker later in 1989 and it was confirmed that at that time no adverse findings had been made concerning Mr Vrisakis. That is another matter that I felt it necessary to come back to and answer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that in debate on the appropriations we are dealing with these matters; nevertheless, as the honourable member has raised them, I will answer them. He made two points in relation to Mr Hartnell. The first related to his partnership in a legal firm and the second to the question of shareholdings. In respect of the first matter, Mr Hartnell is no longer a partner in any legal firm. In respect of the second matter, I assume that the honourable member was referring to the interests of Mr Hartnell in Global Funds Management Australia Ltd. The position there is that Mr Hartnell, through his family company, has an interest in a holding of 10,000 shares in Global Funds Management and I understand that Global has lodged an application with the Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission seeking approval to take over management of Estate Mortgage Trust. That is what did happen. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Mr Hartnell's part as Chairman of the ASC-that is all I want to deal with at the moment in relation to this matter-he is obliged to advise the Attorney-General of all pecuniary interests he has in any body corporate carrying on business in Australia. Where that interest impinges on a matter under consideration by the Commission, he is obliged to disclose the interest-that is quite clear-to the relevant parties and to decline to take part in the matter unless the parties consent. Similarly, as Chairman of the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC), he was obliged to place on a public register notice his pecuniary interests; the honourable member would be aware of this. In accordance with the Act, Mr Hartnell notified the Attorney-General of his interest in Global and I understand that he also complied with the disclosure provisions of the NCSC Act. Further, I understand that he has always informed relevant third parties of shareholdings and refrained from participation in decision making when the NCSC considered Global in connection with the Estate Mortgage Trust. In light of this, any suggestion that Mr Hartnell's interest in Global has affected the proper performance of his duties is totally unfounded and, in fact, mischievous. </PARA>
<PARA> My recollection is that this matter first appeared in the Australian newspaper. It may be worth noting that it printed a retraction of an error which was made in that article which had stated that Mr Hartnell's family company received its Global shareholdings in return for services rendered by Mr Hartnell while a partner in his former firm of Allen Allen and Hemsley, thereby implying, I would have thought, receipt of some sort of secret commission. The later article made it clear that the fee for Mr Hartnell's services was paid to Allen Allen and Hemsley and that his family company's shareholding arose from a totally separate transaction and was purchased from its own resources. So any suggestion of any problem with Mr Hartnell is totally without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of funding was raised by the honourable member for Ryan but taken up more by the honourable member for Higgins, who said that there was a single regulator from 1 January 1990. He complained about the delay in legislation, then conceded that it was extremely complex and technical. That legislation is likely to be in this House in the very near future. The honourable member for Higgins did at least acknowledge the complexity of it; there is no point in hiding that. He then raised the question of funding. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that it is interesting to hear those opposite complaining about funding in this area. Of course, funding for the NCSC-the great cooperative scheme between the Commonwealth and the States-was a matter for the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities; it was not a matter on which the Commonwealth alone could make a decision. That was the major reason why we took the view that one of the real problems in this area was the lack of funds. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders why the ASC was opposed by the honourable member for Ryan because the criticisms that he made about the way the NCSC was operating relate partly to the fact that it was always underfunded. The honourable member for Higgins raised that in more detail, which I will touch on briefly. I think he was mainly concerned about the establishment costs and the ongoing costs. It is clear that this year, and in the early stages, there will be substantial establishment costs because of the type of equipment that has to be bought, particularly in the computer area. The honourable member for Higgins, being knowledgeable in that sort of field, will know that such equipment is costly and that strong establishment costs are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding position is that for 1990-91 the Government has provided the ASC with $107m. In addition to that, however, there are downstream costs of about $6m in the current financial year. By downstream costs, I am referring to downstream agencies such as the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Of course, the funding for these will assist the ASC in the enforcement of the new legislation. As to specific funding detail, which I think the honourable member for Higgins was seeking, the establishment costs for 1991 will be about $43m. The figure will drop in subsequent years because of the initial very high cost not only of equipment but also of office premises, which will be established to meet what was one of the great criticisms by the States-that the Commonwealth would not meet the needs of the business communities in the various capitals. So there is an additional cost there. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall cost for the four-year period will be about $210m, as the honourable member correctly stated. The figure for increased activity in corporate regulation will be about $133m and the establishment costs spread over the four years will be about $77m. Some very detailed information on that was provided by one of the commissioners, Mr Robertson, at the Senate Estimates committee hearing last week. From the information that I have looked at quickly this morning since the issue was raised, I think that over four years it is pretty accurate to say that $133m is the approximate figure for increased activity in corporate regulation and $77m for establishment costs over four years, making the total of $210m to which the honourable member referred. As I have said, the establishment costs will drop substantially. In 1991, they will be $43m, by 1991-92 they will drop to $17m, then to $17m the following year, and in 1993-94 will be $0.5m. So it is in the initial period that we will have the substantial establishment cost. I do not think-one would certainly hope not-that we will have such dramatic conversions to corporate regulation, or the need for it, from various people. I do not think that the honourable member for Higgins was putting that forward as a criticism; I hope that he was merely seeking information. But he did wax a bit eloquent about the fact that there had been delays and that things had not happened as quickly as they should have. </PARA>
<PARA> I could reflect back on the debate with the States, but I do not propose to deal with this matter today, firstly, because I do not have the time and, secondly, because it is not the appropriate place to do it. But, before the honourable member for Higgins becomes too ecstatic about his role and accusations against us, I refer him to an interview he gave on The World Today on 30 April this year. Admittedly, this was only a month after he was elected to the Parliament, but it was not very helpful in terms of bringing about the very necessary single regulator in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, my colleague the honourable member for Corio raised matters which, if I interpreted them correctly, related mainly to the cost of justice. Of course, the cost of justice inquiry, which is currently being carried out, is addressing that issue in some considerable detail. The honourable member for Corio referred to legal aid and various other matters but he also made a very valid point that one of the difficulties that we have today is that in many ways access to justice is limited to the two extremes of the spectrum-on the one hand, to the most disadvantaged and, on the other hand, to those who are extremely wealthy. That clearly has to be addressed. If it is to be addressed properly, we will have to have a fairly positive response from the professions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters were raised which I have not had time to address in detail in my brief response, but I think I have covered most of the matters raised by those opposite and by the honourable member for Corio. I thank those present for their contributions to the debate this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the statement earlier this week by Senator Gareth Evans that Israel should seize the opportunities offered by the Gulf crisis and, in Senator Evans's words, `move now while the balance of Arab forces are, for whatever reason, aligned with the West to defuse the Palestinian issue to the maximum extent possible as soon as possible'. I remind the Acting Prime Minister that President Saddam Hussein's Government is the only other government which has linked the issue of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait with the Palestinian issue. I ask: why has the Australian Government adopted this policy of trying to link progress on the Palestinian issue with the Gulf crisis when every other Western government has not only firmly opposed it, but roundly condemned it when it was suggested by President Hussein?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the great majority of Australians will feel extremely disappointed at Melbourne's failure to win the 1996 Olympic Games. As, I believe, the Prime Minister has already indicated, we must accept with dignity the verdict of the International Olympic Committee. All associated with the Melbourne bid should be commended for the magnificent effort which was put into developing and presenting it. The Government at all times has been proud to be associated with the bid and has welcomed the bipartisan support which basically has come with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was not through a lack of effort or a lack of merit that Melbourne's bid was not accepted by the International Olympic Committee. As the Prime Minister stressed in Tokyo, none of the bids had more intrinsic merit than Melbourne's, but obviously the view of some people within the International Olympic Committee was such that they chose a city other than Melbourne and that was a matter, of course, which always finally and clearly rested with them.</PARA>
<PARA> I am told reliably that the final presentation which Melbourne made in Tokyo was something to be seen and that it brought great commendation from members of the International Olympic Committee and, indeed, representatives of other countries who were there promoting their cities. So it might be that, even though we have lost the games, the presentation will remind many interested people of the qualities of Melbourne as a city, as a place for living and for doing business. So it might not all be a negative outcome in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA> I close by once again commending all those involved in the bid for their magnificent effort, notwithstanding the result. I again welcome the fact that this has been very much a bipartisan matter in the Parliament and that Australia put on a strong and brave performance but just never won the day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Finance inform the House what progress the Government has achieved in reducing the level of Commonwealth Government debt? Can he also say what implications this development has for budgetary policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2164" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say that the Government has made great progress in reducing the level of Commonwealth debt and public debt interest. The reduction in the debt has been made possible by the dramatic turnaround in budgetary policy under this Government. When we came into office we were looking at a deficit of $9.6 billion. We have turned that around to a surplus of $8 billion last year and this year. In fact, we have had surpluses in the last four Budgets. The previous Government never had a surplus in any of its years in government, either under Fraser or the various Prime Ministers before him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consequently, we can now pay off debt rather than accumulate it. When we came into office the Commonwealth debt was 21 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). By June of this year it has been reduced to 13 per cent of GDP. By June of next year it will be down to 10 1/2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth debt liability has obviously plummeted under this Government. So too, therefore, has the interest burden on our debt, which has fallen as a percentage of Commonwealth outlays over the last four years from 10 1/2 per cent of outlays to 6 1/2 per cent. Furthermore, further large reductions are in prospect in the next few years, as the Forward Estimates show, because of the ongoing impact of the savings decisions that we have already taken. The Forward Estimates show that in three years time public debt interest will comprise only 3 1/2 per cent of outlays. We have seen a tremendous reduction from 10 1/2 per cent a few years ago. It represents a saving of $7.5 billion on what interest payments would have been had they still been at 10 1/2 per cent of outlays.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, this projected large fall in public debt interest in the next few years makes virtually no allowance for further assets sales after this year. To the extent that further assets sales can be generated as Cabinet has proposed, further progress can be made in debt repayment and reduction of public debt interest payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of all this for budgetary policy, which is also part of the question, is that firstly it helps to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP. It gives us greater flexibility through a lesser amount of Budget outlays being locked up in obligatory expenditures, and it gives us more capacity to address expenditure areas of high priority whilst maintaining a tight approach to total outlays.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, all this has been made possible by the Government's determination to reduce outlays and its preparedness to take the hard decisions which have enabled outlays to be reduced from 29 1/2 per cent of GDP when we came into office to 23 1/2 per cent now, representing a saving on this year's Budget of $24 billion. That compares extremely well with the Opposition, which when it went out of office in 1983 had outlays of a higher percentage of GDP than when it came into office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the honourable gentleman says is quite right: the report will be released this afternoon. I am not absolutely sure that everything he says in the preamble to his question is amplified by the report, but it could well be so. The intention is to allow three months of public comment on this matter before finally resolving the issue, which I think is a reasonable time given the degree of sensitivity these issues have developed over the years in the Sydney community. When taking a decision like this, which is a significant decision in relation to the future of the Australian aviation industry, one should not conduct oneself in a manner which in any way unnecessarily provokes people who believe that they are likely to suffer detriment from a decision the Government is likely to take. We will proceed with a reasonable period of time for public comment and then finalise the matter after that.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2165" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="TRADE NEGOTIATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I wish to say that the Government's commitment to maintaining our cultural sovereignty in our audiovisual industry should be without question. I believe that the adoption of internationally agreed fair trade rules will safeguard and advance our interests in this sector as well as other service sectors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that a number of organisations involved in the audiovisual industry are concerned at the prospect of this sector being covered in the trade in services agreement presently being negotiated in the Uruguay Round. I emphasise that the draft framework agreement will not oblige any government to abandon any regulations in areas such as local content requirements, television broadcasts, limitations on foreign content in television commercials or limits on foreign ownership in television stations. Appropriate flexibility is provided for in the draft framework for countries to maintain such policies which can be of indefinite duration to the reservation process and which would quarantine these areas from the relevant obligations of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> While no country is seeking the total exclusion of the audiovisual section from the proposed framework agreement, some countries are arguing that the agreement should include provision for cultural values or cultural policy objective exceptions. This is opposed by major countries. The reason for this is that a cultural exception could create a potentially large loophole which could undermine the effectiveness of the framework agreement.  More targeted provisions are available to protect specific aspects of cultural policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart, too, from the difficulties of getting international agreement to excluding this sector from the proposed services agreement, I point out that the exclusion would not mean that the Government's policies in this area would not be modified in the future. They could result in the sector being the subject of even stronger bilateral actions. The European Economic Community requested, and we endorse, the establishment of a working group in Geneva under the auspices of the services negotiations to examine whether any special measures are needed to accommodate the characteristics of the audiovisual sector. The first meeting of that working group was held in Geneva on 27 and 28 August. A representative from the Australian Film Commission and a representative from the Australian Writers Guild were members of the Australian delegation. The next meeting has been scheduled for 5 October and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is continuing its consultations with a wide range of industry and union representatives so that their interests are represented in those negotiations.</PARA>

<PARA> The same applies to uranium. At the moment the Labor Party has a review process in place on the question of uranium policy.

<PARA> When Roxby Downs is coupled with Ranger and Nabarlek, it means that we have been basically supplying to an over-supplied market.

That is sensible. In relation to the other issues, that is, the market and the environment, they need to be considered separately-and they will be. It is those issues which are the basis of the so-called three mines policy. That is why the Labor Party will review them and, in time, come to a decision.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question that has been asked by the honourable member for Page. The National Roads and Motorists Association, of course, is one of the State motorist organisations which come under the umbrella of the Australian Automobile Association (AAA). I notice that the Secretary-General of the AAA has been more recently ducking for cover in relation to the position that the AAA and, of course, the NRMA and the other State motorist organisations adopted on the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report. The Secretary-General has a letter in the Australian Financial Review on the nineteenth of this month, where he claims that he was grossly misrepresented by the Chairman of the Industry Commission, Tony Cole. What Tony Cole did was to suggest that the AAA and its kindred organisations had rejected the ISC report on road pricing and road cost recovery. Mr Lunn says that he has been misrepresented. Here is a letter to me from Mr Lunn, dated 10 July:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The AAA has rejected the Commission's Report and Recommendations in their present form because they add substantially to the cost of motoring in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether they are guilty of intellectual sloth; I think they are. The Secretary-General of a major motorist organisation in Australia has come out with a statement like that when in fact the opposite is the case. The NRMA represents about 4 million motorists, as it claims, in New South Wales. If the ISC recommendations are put into effect, every one of those motorists-private motorists-will benefit to the extent of about $200 every year.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lunn claimed in that letter to me on 10 July that the ISC report and recommendations would add substantially to the cost of motoring in this country. I do not know whether he failed to read the report, or if he read the report he did not understand it, or if he did read it and understood it he deliberately chose to misrepresent it. One of the premises upon which the ISC undertook that exercise of examining and reviewing the possibility of our being able to put into place a much more coherent and economically intelligent approach to road funding and programming was that it would be revenue neutral, and the proposals would be precisely that if they were put into effect. So we have examples of that type of thing coming from the AAA and the NRMA.</PARA>
<PARA> However, to indicate that it is not just the Australian Financial Review which makes references of that kind, Ross Gittins on 10 September said this in relation to this question:</PARA>
<PARA>The Inter-State Commission has a report before the Government that recommends the reform of road taxes. Heavy vehicles would be obliged to pay for the road damage they do and no longer be subsidised by ordinary motorists.</PARA>
<PARA>Those ordinary motorists are supposed to be represented by the NRMA or the AAA, as we know. They claim to do that. They obviously do not do it very successfully or very effectively. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>More tax revenue would be earmarked for roads-</PARA>
<PARA>and motorists, of course, would appreciate that-</PARA>
<PARA>motorists in NSW would make big savings.</PARA>
<PARA>I have indicated that-each motorist $200 a year. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you believe the Australian Automobile Association-representing, among others, the NRMA-has found a reason for rejecting the report. It hasn't got an alternative, it just has doubts. And this from an outfit that carries on about motorists being overtaxed. Here's a lobby group that can't even bring itself to fight for its members' vested interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will perhaps start on Nobby Clark. I will come to Mr Loton, who deserves more regard, later. Nobby is a banker, and bankers in most countries actually favour the maintenance of a sensible anti-inflationary policy. Nobby is the exception to the rule. He believes that the Government should not be embarking upon a sensible demand and inflation management strategy. He also believes that, despite the fact that demand out-stripped product by 2 : 1 through 1988-89 and even into 1989-90, the application of a correct monetary policy was a burden on the banks and not the proper exercise of public policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will let other people make value judgments about that, but generally, whenever bankers scream about interest rates we know that the public interest is getting a kicking somewhere.

Nobby says that he would be selling pencils and shoelaces in Collins Street or something to that effect.</PARA>

I remind honourable members that Nobby's savings bank went insolvent in 1986 and was saved by the bank subsidy introduced by me on behalf of the Government. I will tell honourable members why that happened. He ambitiously loaned funds for housing at fixed rates of 13.5 per cent and then found, in tighter monetary conditions in 1985 and 1986, that he could not fund the deposits that kept those mortgages in place. Had it not been for cross-subsidies from the trading bank and subsidies from the Commonwealth Government, Nobby's board would certainly have had him selling shoelaces and pencils in Collins Street.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just when the game got nasty again in 1989, I was instrumental also in introducing a shift in the statutory reserve deposits, which then saw a decline in the costs of savings banks and, particularly, trading banks, in funding their businesses.

<PARA> In regard to Mr Loton, he has the privilege of running the largest and most significant business in the country. Naturally, anything Mr Loton says will be weighed with due prudence by the Government. He speaks now not only as the chief executive officer of that company, but also as the President-elect of the Business Council of Australia. If Mr Loton has been reported correctly as saying that there is no prospect for an improvement in the economy, I can say only that I think he is too pessimistic and does not need to be. It is true that the economy is slowing, as indeed it should be slowing. Whether it has slowed to the end point of the cycle one does not quite yet know. But the fact of the matter is that this cycle had to be induced, otherwise we would have been building a problem for ourselves in importing and building foreign debt at a pace that was clearly unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA> That illustrates the point I made the other day, which is simply this: members of the anti-inflation constituency in Australian business fold their tents immediately the heat is applied.

<PARA> I simply say to Mr Loton and the Business Council of Australia that if that is their view, I think it is unduly pessimistic. They must realise the virtue of a sensible, disciplined monetary policy and a sensible economic policy to overcome Australia's problems. Though it may be painful for some, it will be less painful than would otherwise be the case if Australia had to have a very heavy recession induced by an unsustainability in our external accounts. Upon more mature reflection, probably one will find that the Business Council of Australia will accept the view that a sensible and disciplined monetary policy is the best way out of a difficult national economic predicament.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of this matter because the honourable member for Burke drew to my attention the concerns that had been expressed by local governments in Victoria about the possible effects on local road funding as a result of the Budget. I would like to emphasise that each of the seven councils in the electorate which the honourable member represents so effectively received a 40 per cent increase in local road funds from last year to this year. For example, in Bacchus Marsh over the five years to 1989-90 the amount of federal funds allocated to local roads increased from $73,000 to $236,000. At Bulla, over those five years, funding increased from $97,000 to $222,000. In Daylesford and Glenlyon, funds increased from $62,000 to $253,000; in Gisborne, from $67,000 to $222,000; in Melton, from $105,000 to $234,000; in Newham and Woodend, from $46,000 to $213,000; and in Kyneton, from $86,000 to $235,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot be sure whether those increases were as a result of the fact that the honourable member had been making representations about the formula upon which funds were distributed between various local authorities; but I would not be surprised if the honourable member were just as successful in connection with that issue as he has been in connection with so many others. I believe it is a credit to the honourable member that he has been able to bring about that improvement.</PARA>
<PARA> This year, as a result of decisions that have been made by this Government, $1.6 billion will be applied to land transport development. That compares with $1.34 billion which was allocated last year, which compared with $1.22 billion the previous year. From last year to this year there has been a 13 per cent increase in real terms. I want local government generally to understand that every cent of that $1.6 billion that will be spent across Australia-apart from a few areas of Australia which are not incorporated, in the sense of being brought into the local government structure and arrangement-will be spent in local government areas. This government has fulfilled its responsibility in the area of local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA> During its seven years in government, the Fraser Government provided a total of $3,470m in untied funding to local councils-that is in real terms, not in nominal terms. The amount that we have provided in our seven years in government, excluding this year when there was another $22m jump in the allocation anyway, was $4,670m. This means that, in real terms, the Hawke Government in its seven years in office has increased the volume of funds going to local councils for general purposes by $1.200m over and above what the Fraser Government provided. That is almost an increase, in real terms, of something like $200m every year.</PARA>
<PARA> Local government knows that since 1974, as a result of the initiative that was taken then by the Labor Government and Federal funds were made available to directly fund local government, some 850 councils across Australia have benefited to the extent of about $8,500m in untied grants. In addition, there are earmarked grants for roads. As I say, the result in the electorate of Burke has been nothing short of outstanding.</PARA>

As the honourable member is well aware, in his last statement as Minister for Communications he made an attack on Senator Button, who was then the Opposition spokesman on communications, for daring to suggest that in the value added area it would be a good thing to have a bit of private competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite excoriated him, and inveighed against the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and said it ought to take serious action against Senator Button to make absolutely certain that he was brought into a correct course of action.

Honourable members ought to be aware of that when they sit down and contemplate the qualifications of the honourable member for Menzies to put forward these sorts of propositions. He is pretty good on the sarcasm with his colleagues and around this House but he does not like an open discussion of that element of the record.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I should explain what is meant by the Andriessen Assurance. In 1985 the Government reached agreement with the European Community and the then Agricultural Commissioner, Mr Frans Andriessen, that the EC would not export subsidised beef into certain Asian markets, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. In return, it was understood that Australia would not pursue action in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the EC beef regime, it being GATT illegal-as it probably still is. Mr Andriessen and I negotiated that assurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, in recent months the current European Community Commissioner, Mr MacSharry, has indicated he is likely to seek the scrapping of the assurance. Mr MacSharry should be in no doubt that Australia would regard such a move extremely seriously. Last week, the Prime Minister sent a strongly worded letter to the EC President, Mr Jacques Delors, warning that the abrogation of the Andriessen assurance would not only seriously detract from the EC's commitment to the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations-those negotiations seeking trade liberalisation and a reduction in agricultural support, protection and trade distorting subsidies-but would also affect the broader political and economic relationship between Australia and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister told Mr Delors that if the EC was having problems disposing of its beef surpluses there are other ways of doing so rather than through subsidised exports, which are the most pernicious form of trade distortion. The current beef surpluses in the EC are of the EC's own making. They are caused by the inflated and artificial prices paid for beef under the common agricultural policy. As well, there is consumer reaction to mad cow disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and the EC should accept the message being sent by the marketplace and get down to reforming its support and protection regime and trade distorting subsidies in the round itself.</PARA>
<PARA> I should make clear that the assurance does not prevent unsubsidised competition in these Asian and Pacific markets and efficient Australian beef producers should have no concern about taking on fair, open and unsubsidised competition. However, the EC has now been placed on notice about the Andriessen assurance, and Australia will vigorously pursue all options available should the EC be tempted to scrap the assurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is unbelievable. The Acting Leader of the Opposition gets up with a cheap quote thrown in a cheap circumstance from Mr Clark towards me. He quotes it to me and when I quote back to the Opposition the fact that Mr Clark could not even run his own savings bank without my help in 1986, the Opposition regards it as irresponsible. Talk about thin-skinned. Honourable members opposite have more front than Mark Foys. The fact of the matter is that one does not have to have any confidential information. It is not possible to run a savings bank, lending loans at 13.5 per cent-and lending them ambitiously for market share-and funding those loans at 16 per cent. In other words, the deposit costs were 16 to 17 per cent. One does not have to be an economic genius to work that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was happening, obviously, was that the National Australia Bank at that point was heading for insolvency-the savings bank-in 1986. It would have been clear to anyone in the marketplace. What was happening then was that the trading bank was propping it up, and Mr Clark was saved from his strategic mistake by me. So if it gets around to pencils and shoelaces, what I suggested to the questioner was that if I had left Mr Clark to his own decisions, it would have been him who was selling the pencils and shoelaces in the street down there and not me.</PARA>
<PARA> So if a banker like Mr Clark attacks the Government for the sensible application of monetary policy and then blackguards the Treasurer on the basis that he cannot run the economy, at least he should do that from the vantage point that he can run his institution. But when that institution had to be propped up by Government policy from the very same Treasurer, if I had been Mr Clark I would have gracefully retired.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long and quite exquisite internal agony of the Australian Labor Party on the subject of privatisation is nearing its climax. Next Monday at the National Convention Centre here in Canberra a specially convened national conference of the Australian Labor Party will meet and decide the fate of the tentative decisions that have been taken by the Government on this particular issue. Amongst the less remarkable things that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave utterance to at Question Time today was his statement of fascination at the fact that the Opposition should be so interested in the internal machinations of the Australian Labor Party at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say to you, Mr Speaker, that unashamedly we are very interested in the internal workings of the Australian Labor Party at present. I do not think it has been since the great split of the 1950s that those who study the politics of the Australian Labor Party have had such a rich smorgasbord of dissent and different points of view than we have been presented with over the last few weeks on this issue of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA> If anybody has any doubt about that, that doubt would have been dispelled last Monday night when in the closing hours of the debate on the appropriation legislation the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker)-no mere neophyte in Labor Party politics, not a Johnny-come-lately, not an innocent in the factional politics of the Australian Labor Party, but a former senior Minister, an Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales for five years, a senior active member of the Labor Party for 20 years-delivered one of the most remarkable speeches of condemnation of the policies of the Government of which he is a member that this House has heard in a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a remarkable comment on the powers of observation of many in the press gallery that this speech went utterly and completely unreported. It underpins the degree of internal wrangling and dissension that is taking place inside the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me remind honourable members of one of the things that the honourable member for Robertson said:</PARA>
<PARA>This blind faith in the inherent value of competition is characteristic of the thinking of economic rationalists that dominate both the Thatcher and Hawke Cabinets. </PARA>
<PARA>In the words of the former Wran Government Attorney-General for New South Wales, the newly elected member for Robertson, one of the firebrands of the Left in New South Wales, says that there is no difference in economic policy between the Hawke Government and the Thatcher Government. After that little utterance all I can say to members of the Labor Party opposite is no wonder we on this side of the House have a total fascination with their internal politics. The honourable member for Robertson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances it was predictable-to all, of course, but the Labor Party faithful-that when macro-economic measures of financial deregulation, tax cuts, high interest rates, massive surpluses and the concomitant cuts to government spending all failed to make any significant impression on the external debt--</PARA>
<PARA>they certainly have not --</PARA>
<PARA>or the underlying high rate of inflation the Government would follow in Mrs Thatcher's footsteps and put privatisation on the top of the economic agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words were uttered only a week after the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke in almost moving, almost tear-jerking, terms of his great friend Margaret Thatcher. What a long way we have travelled from those acidic exchanges over South Africa that occurred between Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Thatcher in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Not to be outdone in his rhetoric this firebrand of the Left in New South Wales, this former Leader of the House in New South Wales, this former senior Wran Government Minister, the honourable member for Robertson, said:</PARA>
<PARA>The current neo-classical economic fixation of the Hawke Government is but a phase. Soon political pragmatism and relentless critical party rank and file will return Labor to the Keynesian policies of government intervention to achieve price level stability, output growth, full employment and a balance of payments equilibrium. The Labor leopard has not changed its spots-Cabinet has merely temporarily lost sight of them. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the words, not of one of us-we could think of some pleasant things to say-but of a Government member. That is a symbol of the torment and agony of the Australian Labor Party on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Not to be outdone, that old war horse, Clyde Cameron-a former member for Hindmarsh and great mate of Gough Whitlam-has had a few things to say in the Bulletin today. He said that he is appalled at the Government's plans to privatise Australian Airlines, Qantas Airways Ltd, Aussat Pty Ltd and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>What they are going to do this year is to sell off the furniture and next year the crockery and the next year there'll be nothing left to sell. It will be the end of the Labor Government and it will widen still further the huge chasm that separates the Labor Government from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>When one reads these statements and then walks along the corridor past the office of the present member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) one will see that he has put up a very endearing notice. It is a sketch of a light on a hill and underneath is a sign that says, `Light on the Hill. Sold for 30 pieces of silver on 30 August 1990'. </PARA>
<PARA> So it goes on. One can almost conjure up a vision as delegates file into the Labor Party's national conference at the National Convention Centre next Monday. A quartet of Frank Walker, John Scott, Clyde Cameron and Stewart West will be singing in unison the chorus and refrain to that socialist hymn The Red Flag. </PARA>
<PARA> One ought not forget that this debate is not only about this enormous internal, gut-wrenching dispute inside the Labor Party. All the bravado and cheap and irresponsible political point-scoring by people like the Treasurer at Question Time cannot hide the deep divisions that exist within the Government on this issue. We should not be blinded by those divisions into overlooking the fact that the decision which has been taken by the Government on this issue is still, in the words of my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown),`the third best option available to the Government in the area of telecommunications'. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, four options were available to the Government on this issue, quite apart from the policy espoused by the Opposition which is the only truly economical and rational policy-that is to have full, unfettered competition and to privatise Telecom after the establishment of that competition. The first and clearly the most rational of those basic options, although a long way short of the ideal set down by the Opposition, was the Keating option. That was to build a separate competitive carrier around a merger of OTC and Aussat. If Telecom is to be publicly owned forever-I know that the Treasurer does not want this, but most of the Labor Party does-then a competitor must be built around the merger of OTC and Aussat. That was the first option and the most sensible one. </PARA>
<PARA> The second option, and the one that will probably be approved, is the Beazley option. The Beazley option is really the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) option. It is not really the Beazley option. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beazley" NAMEID="PE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ha, ha!</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may well laugh. Government members are very good at laughing. They laugh and bluster very well, but when it comes to some of the facts, the last thing that the true economic rationalists in the Cabinet really wanted was the Beazley option. If the Government really wanted-in the words of the Minister-`to lever up competition against a publicly owned Telecom', the most effective way of levering up that competition would have been to build the competitor around a privatised OTC and not to sink a lean, efficient, internationally respected OTC into the flabby, overweight, inefficient Telecom because that is basically what the Minister has done and it is a major blunder of the telecommunications policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third option is the Telecom option which has so clearly and fearlessly been enunciated by Mr McLean and all the other people in the Telecom unions who have said, `We are in favour of freeing up the system; it is just that we don't want Telecom to have any competition'. That comment is a bit like people who say that they believe in free enterprise but they do not want the market to push them around. </PARA>
<PARA> The final option, of course, is the Walker-Cameron option. That borrows an attitude from the Left on uranium, that is, that we leave it all exactly as it is, as we would leave all the uranium in the ground. Despite the overwhelming logic of the case put forward by the Treasurer, if one examines this issue carefully, even within the constraints of the policy laid down by the Labor Party-that is, that Telecom should remain in public ownership-the real reason why the Government has finally opted for the decision that has now been announced is the clout of the public sector unions, particularly the ATEA, which is probably, in quantum terms, about the most powerful union in Australia at present. If the Government really wanted serious competition, the logical thing to have done was to have gone down the path enunciated by the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the features of trade unionism in Australia over the last few years has been the steady decline of the influence of blue collar unions and the steady decline of unionism in the private sector. Although the Government may not like it to be acknowledged, only 32 per cent of the total private sector work force now belong to unions. The total union percentage of 42 per cent is boosted by the fact that 68 per cent of the public sector work force is required to belong to a union. </PARA>
<PARA> The long battle that has existed in the trade union movement between the Professional Radio and Electronics Institute of Australasia (PREIA), which is the predominant union in the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and which is a right wing affiliated union, and the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA), which is a left wing affiliated union and which has obvious predatory designs on the smaller right wing competitor, is the real reason why the option favoured by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) won the support of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Communications understands the internal machinations of the Labor Party. At the beginning of debate on this issue he knew that victory would go to the Minister in the Hawke Cabinet who aligned himself with the ATEA. Government members will carry on and guffaw. They will go through Martin Ferguson and the mob. They will go through the process of trying to extract a few further concessions. They will say, `It was a tough fight'. They will say that they were not satisfied with what the Australian Government has given them but, at the end of the day, they will have a deal which owes more to the clout of that particular union than to the influence of any single Cabinet Minister or to any other section of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA> The only really substantial section of the labour movement left in this country which has a major influence within a now very diverse Labor Party is, of course, the public sector unions. On this occasion the public sector unions have demonstrated not only a capacity to cause a very long, bitter and protracted debate inside the Labor Party on this issue, but as well they have demonstrated a capacity to deny an outcome so clearly favoured by the Prime Minister, an outcome passionately argued for by the Treasurer, an outcome that even according to their own restricted and blinkered economic parameters would be of far more economic sense than the outcome that has been argued for, so it appears, successfully, by the Minister for Transport and Communications.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an indication that on this occasion, as on so many other occasions, the Government has been prepared to put the influence and the clout of unions generally, and most particularly on this occasion the public sector unions, ahead of the national interest. That is why the Government is rapidly losing the confidence of the Australian people; that is why whatever is adopted next Monday will be a third worst option; and that is why the Government deserves the condemnation of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have learnt one thing in the last couple of days, and that is not to sit having dinner in the dining room with my friends and colleagues from the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the rest of the trade union movement and be bypassed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his very lovely daughter and draw attention to the fact-as everybody ought to know-that we are conducting discussions with those interests in the community along with everything else. Apart from that particular piece of teaching that I ought to pick up in terms of the politics of this issue, there is very little else to learn from what the honourable gentleman had to say in his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No-one who knows anything about the processes we are going through in the deliberations of the Party in substantially changing policy in the telecommunications area could look at that seriously, understand it, and then come up with a motion like this. It is an absurdity. The Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) has made its position very clear from the outset of these discussions: it will cop no network competition. From the point of view of the Government, network competition is seminal to competition. There is obviously a serious disagreement between the Government and the ATEA on this matter. It is a position, nevertheless, which the Government chooses to persist with because it is governing the country and because the decision that it has taken is a decision in the national interest and in the interest also of competition in the telecommunications area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to delve into history to find where might be the background of this obsession on the part of the Opposition that somehow the ATEA is ruling Government policy when it comes to the consideration of telecommunications matters. I suppose it does, in fact, lie in its experience. It is worth going through that experience because, unlike us, who are confronting sections of the trade union movement on this issue, the Opposition did nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I had occasion in Question Time to refer to the final statement of the last Liberal Minister for communications during the election campaign on 3 March 1983, two days before he lost the election. He included remarks by Senator Button at a press conference. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>At his press conference on 8 February, Senator Button was asked whether there would be competition in the market for terminals, telephones, telex machines and other equipment. He replied, `Yes, I think that it is feasible that that could occur'. Again he said, `Yes, certainly, I am sure that could take place'. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Minister, who obviously will follow me in this debate, then said:</PARA>
<PARA>So far as I know, the ALP is the only party which has now taken a firm decision in favour of competition with Telecom. If it were not for that fact, the fact that the Telecom unions were now clearly a Labor Party front, one would expect them to be honest about this and condemn the ALP position. So far as the Government is concerned, competition in the terminal market is an open question and the Government will consider this in the light of its further consideration of the recommendations of the Davidson Committee report. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not say, `What rubbish'. That happens to be a fact. We opened up competition in that area when we came into office-that area which the honourable member said the Telecom unions ought to instruct us not to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We then move on and look at the last performance of the Opposition when it came to dealing with the ATEA when it was in office and the ATEA put in a claim. It put in a claim and had that claim rejected by the Industrial Relations Commission. It then went on strike, and this is what the report of the outcome had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In proceedings before the Commission and in private conferences Telecom and the staff organisations attempted to find a resolution of the dispute which was acceptable to all parties and was consistent with the principles of wage determination. An agreement reached between Telecom, the ATEA and the APTU was submitted to a Full Bench of the Commission on 10 June. That bench, in a decision of the same date, refused to recommend, endorse or ratify the agreement. This agreement included reference to the resolution of certain aspects of technological change in Telecom by 1 July 1982-</PARA>
<PARA>it did not just go to the issue of allowances-</PARA>
<PARA>and the payment of an allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>On 11 June, the Government decided to permit the agreement to be implemented by Telecom, subject to the cessation of all industrial action. Members of both staff organisations at mass meetings accepted the terms of agreement and industrial action ceased. Telecom subsequently implemented the agreement which involved, inter alia, the payment of allowances to staff in the groups concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also at the time another of those craven press releases put out by the government of the day saying that in the end it was helpless. The press release, put out under the names of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), says:</PARA>
<PARA>In these circumstances, the Government believes it has no alternative but to allow Telecom to honour its agreement, subject to all union bans being lifted and normal work resuming. </PARA>
<PARA>This was after they stood the Opposition's wages policy on its head. This demonstrates the Opposition's capacity, in circumstances in which people are attempting to introduce either a wages policy or micro-economic reform-and it is some of the same individuals who are suggesting to the electorate that they ought to put them in place-to handle these problems when it is in government. Do not wander around this place mocking the Labor Party's decision making processes when we have been arriving at the conclusions in this area after great dispute and constant conflict with some of the unions involved. By no means is this particular concern today and over this week the first time that we have had a disagreement with the ATEA when it comes to the direction of communications policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have opened up competition in value added services, which is absolutely critical for capacity, for business to establish private networks and get for themselves some efficiencies in the pricing of communications arrangements and to get competition going in the area of the hardware associated with those value added services. We have, over the objection of the ATEA, pushed these through since we have been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, when we came into office the situation with Telecom was that it was the regulator. It determined the nature of competition as telecommunications would emerge in the Australian community. We took that regulatory power out of the hands of Telecom and handed it to Austel. So I might well be asked questions about this and that in Austel, but there was no Austel when we came into office; we implemented Austel as part of our micro-economic reform agenda. It was we who, in the area of international telecommunications, allowed to some extent the development of private satellite terminals in this country, opening up competition in that area. So across the board, against the frequent objections of the industrial organisations, we have implemented what we consider is necessary for introducing competition into this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though the actual participants on the Liberal Party front bench have not actually had to confront these issues in their political life in the past. By the time the honourable member who moved this motion came to sit in a Cabinet which had to consider that particular industrial dispute, he had been a senior Minister and a Treasurer for some six years, and yet he was a participant in a government that virtually had to stand up and say, `As far as wages policy is concerned, we surrender'. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly prior to our coming into office we had the now shadow Minister for communications, then the Minister for Communications, standing up and heckling the Labor Party for not only leaving itself room but actually committing itself to the substantial breach to that point in time in Telecom's reserve powers and saying, `Sool the unions onto the ALP, bring the ALP into line, otherwise you are just craven ALP followers'. </PARA>
<PARA> No member of the Opposition has any idea of how to deal with the trade union movement in this country. Opposition members have a capacity to make grand statements, to issue sweeping generalisations about disunity or whatever in the Labor Party, and yet when the Opposition comes to deal with these things when it is in government, these experienced Ministers-not inexperienced Ministers-have no capacity whatsoever to confront the problems and deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members expect Government members in this place to roll over and determine whether they can hold a candle to them on these sorts of issues. Obviously they expect that the Government will have paroxysms of guilt; that somehow or other when engaged in a degree of difficult negotiations and discussions with an organisation which has declared itself seminally against Government policy, the Government should take seriously their right to move a motion on this sort of matter and to accept the common sense of the proposition they put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the Government's past practice, what has been proposed by the Government for telecommunications competition is revolutionary. When one takes into account what is done in other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with which Australia likes to compare itself, one sees that the Government's proposal is revolutionary. Let me again go through the status of network competition in the countries of the OECD, as I have had occasion to do in the past: Austria, monopoly; Belgium, government monopoly; Canada, limited competition on trunk, not across the board; Denmark, monopoly; Finland, monopoly regional and international. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government would like to compare Australia with the bulk of those larger countries that I have just listed which are members of the OECD. If the Opposition likes to compare itself and its policy intent with New Zealand, that is a matter for the Opposition. I respect the desire of Opposition members to establish their own icons, those they would worship and seek to identify with, and those with whom they wish to align their fate. Members on this side respect the right of Opposition members to make those choices, and we shall make ours. </PARA>
<PARA> What we say to the bulk of those countries with whom we like to compare ourselves is that at this stage the Government intends to take a decision that will substantially open up telecommunications to a more competitive environment than has existed in the past. That will be done in the face of a deal of opposition. Naturally, in those circumstances, it makes life extremely difficult for the Government as it attempts to get that decision through sections of the Labor Party which could validly point to the fact that other people do things differently from what we intend to do. The Government will take that point of view on board because it is the Government of steady progress in micro-economic reform in this community, and of steady progress in the telecommunications area. The Government knows the correct process for getting things through this community and is prepared to do that, whether it be in regard to wages policy or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government ultimately is about sensible management. We live in a democracy and not a dictatorship. That involves an obligation upon the Government to consult with wide sections of the community, not just the trade union movement. In the end the Government must make up its mind. It has done so in regard to these matters and is putting that proposition before the conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin my remarks in this debate by taking up the last point that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) made. The world has moved a long way since 1983. We have moved a long way in this country as well. Our complaint about the Government's approach to telecommunications is simply this: despite what the Minister can read out about the situation in Iceland, Luxembourg, in this country or that country, the harsh reality is that in the area of telecommunications the rest of the world has made a definite move towards competition. It has not been this half-hearted, third best competition which the present Government is adopting, but full-blooded competition. Already in some of the countries of the world consumers are starting to derive the benefits of that competition. Our complaint about the Government is that its present position is denying to the Australian people and to Australian business the prospects of acquiring those benefits of true competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one falsity surrounding this issue that we should get rid of entirely at the outset, and that is the argument that the Minister keeps advancing that, in some way, we are taking a great leap forward in terms of the competition which the Government has proposed and agreed upon. I do not imagine that the Minister will listen to my rebuttal of this view, but I hope that the Minister, the House and the Australian people will take some notice of what the Department of the Treasury thinks about this Minister's argument. Of course, the Minister is walking out of the chamber, which I suppose is some indication of his concern about an ongoing debate on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take these questions in order. The Minister's submission, advocating and proposing the Government's present policy on telecommunications, was circulated to all departments. The staff in all of the economic departments and all of the economic Ministers turned their minds to the Minister's submission in order to decide what they thought about it-whether it was a desirable and sensible proposal for Australia to adopt. Without exception, they all rejected it. As I said before, I do not expect, for one moment, that the Minister will accept what I am saying in regard to this matter. But let us listen to what the Treasury says about this Minister's proposals and, so far as we can gather, the Government's present policy on telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen two things during this debate. Firstly, we have seen the Labor Party factions fall upon each other like a pack of hungry wolves. In the course of that fight we have seen an avalanche of secret Cabinet documents-most of which end up on my desk, I might add-submissions and memoranda and, can you believe it, Cabinet decisions. That is how far it has gone-Cabinet decisions now leak from this Government. We know, in intimate detail, all of the arguments that are put forward and all of the rebuttals. I do not take any pride in the fact that these documents are being leaked, but it is a very clear indication of this internal war within the Labor Party which is tearing it apart. Rival camps are now leaking Cabinet submissions and decisions in order to promote their own cause. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not concerned about the internal machinations of the Labor Party; we are concerned about the merits of this issue. It is very instructive indeed to look at what the Treasury has said about the present Government's policy. One of the papers that has been leaked to the entire world-or so it seems-is one by the Treasury which gives a commentary on the present Minister's proposals and the Government's present policy. It makes a number of very significant points which we believe should carry the day on this argument. The first point it makes is that reform should not be about simply finding a model that Telecom Australia and the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) are comfortable with. Yet is that not the very approach that the Government has taken-to see what is comfortable for the ATEA and, of course, for the trade union movement as a whole?</PARA>
<PARA> Is that not the reason why the meeting last night, which was to be the last round-up, the final settlement, between the unions and the Government before the conference next Monday, was abandoned? Was not the reason that the meeting was abandoned that those opposite could not get to a position where the ATEA was prepared to say, `Yes, we will go along with that'. </PARA>
<PARA> These conferences and meetings will go on and on until one point is reached-and that is when the ATEA says, `Yes, the proposals you have put up are comfortable for us'. That is exactly the point the Treasury has made. That is the very worst approach that could be taken and the very worst test that could be used. The Treasury goes on to say that creating uncompetitive domestic markets in the mistaken belief that they would nurture the growth of large enterprises able to take on the world is exactly what this Minister is on about. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the absurdity, as the Treasury says, of the approach of the present Minister. He says that Telecom will beat the world and be bigger than American Telephone and Telegraph. As the Treasury says, if the Government approaches its policy formulation on that pie-in-the-sky nonsense, it will achieve nothing. That is exactly what the Government has achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury goes on to say that anything which stops short of full network competition will not get to the nub of the problem. Of course, the Minister has stopped short of that point and has not conceded the important point that that is what reform in telecommunications should be about. The Treasury was very prescient and was able to see exactly that the proposal by the Minister was going to succeed-that is, the proposal to combine Telecom and OTC Ltd into this megacom. The Treasury was able to say that the creation of megacom by itself is a step backwards to a less competitive, more entrenched structure. There it is in a nutshell. The Treasury's view is that the Government's proposals are a step backward and not a step forward to increasing competition in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Even today we have heard a lot from this Minister about the great brave competitive world being introduced in telecommunications. The Treasury and all the other economic departments and Ministers have told him that that is not what is being introduced. The proposal will not bring real competition into telecommunications in this country and the Government's policy has been a failure to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasury goes on to say-and this is a considerable endorsement of the Opposition's policy-that if the market is not contestable, that is, open to any entrant, there will not be vigorous and sustained competition with megacom in domestic services. That really is the very big distinction between us and the Government. We commit ourselves to competition, just as the Government mouths the empty notion of competition. We say that if we are going to have competition and have its full benefits for the consumer, we must have full and open competition. That is where the Minister has fallen a long way short. As the Australian Telecommunications Authority (Austel) has already said in an independent report, duopoly will achieve very little, if anything, in terms of bringing to the Australian people the benefits of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasury finally goes on to say that there is no way in which a regulated duopoly-and that is what the Government has proposed-which precludes any threat of entry can come close to providing the competition which would come from a fully contestable market facing unrestricted entry. </PARA>
<PARA> There we have it. On any test at all, the Government's proposals will not bring us the benefits of competition. We have seen-as we have said in this debate already today, and we repeat it because it deserves to be emphasised-that there is only one reason why the Government has not been able to finalise its proposals, and that is that the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and ATEA have not yet agreed to them. </PARA>
<PARA> We make a prediction, which will undoubtedly come true, that the Government will give in to the trade union movement, as it always does, because the union movement controls the Government. The price that will be paid is twofold. First, the Government will agree to give the ACTU a seat on the board of Austel and will agree to its associated unions having an influence in Austel which they should not have because that body should, above all, be independent. The Government will compromise the independence of Austel, which will be the price that the Government will pay to get its so-called reforms through. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have seen three of the great debaters in the Parliament take part in the debate: the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley); but on this matter the Australian Labor Party has led the debate. On this matter, Labor is prepared to debate the issue within the Party. Labor is the great coalition in Australian politics. And Labor is sorting this matter out in true democratic fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Liberal Party of Australia got rid of its debate on transport and communications. McPhee lost his preselection and members on that side of the House who are interested in debating transport and communications issues within their Party lost preselection. That is why we are now seeing a new round of faces on the Opposition front bench with us here today. So it is Labor that sorted the matter out. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong should have more time to move around the Parliament and see what people have on their walls. I move around the Parliament occasionally and I have heard a member of the National Party of Australia say, `I do not mind privatisation as long as we keep getting all the services and as long as they call it by some other name'. Members of the National Party are worried about privatisation and I do not blame them for worrying because there are big dangers for both country and city Australia in the coalition's unholy alliance on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, honourable members have always tended to give one view in opposition and another view in government. Look at protection. They talked a lot about protection in the days of the Whitlam Government but they went backwards when they got back into government under Fraser. They talked about getting rid of the two-airline policy but they did not do it when they got into government. They cannot get it together. </PARA>
<PARA> What if miraculously they did happen to get it together? What if the dogmatic line they are talking about on selling the great public enterprises did take place? What if they did get competition for the sake of competition? They appear more interested in getting competition for the sake of competition than actually working out what is best for the Australian public and what is best for our great enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Who would pay the $16 billion for Telecom-Bond, Skase, Elliott? Who would pay for all the other public enterprises the Opposition wants to sell-Australian Airlines Ltd, the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas Airways Ltd? Where would it get some $30 billion to $35 billion from the sale of these enterprises? The Opposition is either going to sell them for a song-that is, if it happens to get the chance, and I do not think it will-or it will sell them to overseas interests. It would not be able to sell them in Australia. We know from experience in recent years that it would not be able to sell them in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Then what will happen to the community service obligations (CSO)? Opposition members will put them into the Budget. That is their plan, to put them in the Budget and expose them to all the probing and the pruning of pre-Budget discussions that take place. </PARA>
<PARA> Then they will have to work out just where the CSOs are going to go and where they are not going to go. Will they keep unlimited times on local telephone calls? We have had the views of representatives of groups such as Lifeline, who say that they have an average of 35 minutes for a call and it is very important that no-one hang up, that the call keep on going. Will Opposition members choose to do that or will they choose sacrificing cross-subsidies to regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably in Budget discussions something has to go and the community service obligations will not last if the matter is left in the Budget context. They cannot do both; they cannot keep local calls unlimited in time and keep giving the cross-subsidies to regional Australia. Every National Party member in the House knows that there are small post offices, telephone exchanges and telephone systems which would go if Telecom were owned by private enterprise. They know that it would be very hard to keep services in country Australia if private enterprise owned those services. They know it and that is why they are so cautious about this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition had its way, what would happen to the other important community service obligations to the disabled, the blind and the other people who are helped by the obligations we have through Telecom? That is why the Government has said that Telecom will not be sold off. It is an extremely important part of the Government's policy. That, I believe, is because the Government is not tied to a dogmatic belief either way. It looks at what is the best for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Opposition's proposals, what would happen to the policies of these enterprises? The way the Opposition is talking, we ought to be looking at the United Kingdom and the United States. But in the United Kingdom, to provide a service in outback Scotland costs a farmer $A10,000. I think it is $1,200 maximum to put in a service in rural Australia, no matter what the distance. That is the sort of choice we are going to have if the Opposition is able to bring about its policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United States I telephoned from one side of Los Angeles to the centre of Los Angeles, no further than one side of Sydney to the other side of Sydney or one side of Melbourne to the other side of Melbourne. For a six-minute call, it cost me $US1.90. We talk about free local calls within the United States, but it is only within a three or four-mile radius of the local area. So there are big problems if we try to adopt the systems in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needed to do what the Minister, his team and the transport and communications committee of Caucus -particularly the telecommunications group which my friend the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) has been involved with in the development of policy over the past three or four years-have done. They looked at the record, at the achievements, at the mistakes in every country and realised that Australia has to have a policy which is uniquely Australian. That means that they learn from the successes of other countries. They learn from the mistakes of other countries and have a policy which is Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> That policy will not work unless we consult the trade union movement. That is why the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association are involved. We have not taken their line completely. They do not expect us to take their line completely. They expect full discussion, as does business, and we have taken them into account. We have even taken into account the quiet words from the members of the National Party who warn us about the problems of going fully private and fully to non-government ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing which the Opposition is neglecting in the debate-it has come up before this House three or four times, I think, in debates on telecommunications-is what the Business Council of Australia said. It said that two-thirds of our achievable micro-economic reforms are in land transport. Why does the Opposition not have before this chamber a matter of public importance on land transport, where most of the micro-economic reforms will take place. It is an extremely important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bennelong agrees, we will look forward to his motion. Land transport is one of the great challenges of this country. It has been neglected for too long, but now, through the national freight initiative, through the Inter-State Commission report, we are prepared to make the hard decisions in land transport. Benefits worth $2 billion are available to people, to car drivers and to the Australian public if we take up these reforms, particularly road and rail reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that I agreed with the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) when he said that the National Roads and Motorists Association is getting right away from the interests of car drivers when it is not prepared to support the Inter-State Commission report which provides for mass distance charges. Again, we need to get into consultation; again we need to work out exactly the way we are going; that is what this Government is doing. I believe that the real debate after the conference is not going to be within this Government-we are sorting it out now. Let the Opposition sort out its policies, so that it can govern-I doubt it will get the opportunity-without climbing down, so that it is not blinded by dogma, competition for competition's sake. </PARA>

<PARA> That the article headed `Lift ban on HIV partners-gay lobby' by Mr M. Daly in the Melbourne Sunday Herald of 16 September 1990 be referred to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA>Very briefly, yesterday I made a statement to the House in relation to this matter. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations at its meeting followed the procedure which you, Mr Speaker, outlined in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> After following the procedure we were still of the view that the article was of such a serious nature and constituted such serious interference with the work of the Committee-in particular, with the possibilities not only of that Committee but other committees in relation to confidential information before parliamentary committees-that it warrants immediate reference to the Committee of Privileges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is an unfortunate motion. I think that by continuing the controversy it will serve only to continue to polarise community attitudes towards migration. The essential reason there is so much paranoia on this question is that a large percentage of the Australian community feels that it is powerless. People feel, rightly or wrongly, that immigration policy for some time has been driven by special interests and elitism. This motion helps reinforce that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion arises out of the publication on 16 September by the Melbourne Sunday Herald newspaper of an article by journalist Martin Daly. The article concerns the entry and residence in Australia of persons with HIV infection who are partners of Australian residents. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations apparently directed that evidence given to the Committee, on which the newspaper article may have been based, should be given confidentially. </PARA>
<PARA> In commenting on this matter on 17 September, Mr Speaker, you indicated that for the remainder of the Budget session you advocated a certain procedure for dealing with breaches of privilege affecting committees. You indicated that you would require the Committee to present to the House a special report and you said that this report would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . give members of the House a chance to see the Committee's report and to form an opinion of the report prior to the matter being debated. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee in this case has not presented a report that members have had `a chance to see'. There is no such document. The Chairman has merely offered a few words in the chamber which gave no real idea of the basis for the determination of the Committee that a substantial interference with its work had occurred. That is the question-the substantial interference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee Chairman has not justified the Committee's decision to confer confidentiality on the evidence. It is apparently taken as read that such a matter should be dealt with confidentially, but I would like to suggest that there are competing considerations. The public has a right to know how public policy on immigration or any other matter is being formulated. Matters of particular sensitivity, such as the identity of witnesses who may be prejudiced by publicity, can be maintained in confidence. There is no rationale for keeping from the public the details of broad policy questions under consideration, as seems to be the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> The article the subject of the motion reported on policy issues. It did not name any individual. It did not name the particular group which made the confidential submission to the Committee. That particular group has a public profile. Its aims are not secret. It is very unlikely that a community group set up openly to achieve certain policy changes will suffer because it becomes widely known that it has made precisely the sorts of representations that one might expect it to make to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has resolved that the publication constitutes substantial interference with the work of the Committee. That was reported to the House by the Chairman. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 provides in section 4 that an essential element of the offence alleged to have occurred is that the conduct amounts, or is intended or is likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations of its authority or functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Your direction, Mr Speaker, very wisely went somewhat further. You indicated that the Committee should resolve that the conduct was a substantial interference. In either case it is not at all obvious that any such conduct has occurred. The Committee Chairman has not told the House how the Committee's authority has been interfered with in any way that is likely to lead to any real detriment. The Chairman has not shown the House that the Committee's functions have been impaired. It has not been shown how the conduct which has occurred here will substantially interfere with the Committee's work or damage the public interest. All that has been shown is a technical breach. </PARA>
<PARA> Arraigned against this mere technical breach of confidentiality are much more important considerations. A journalist in his newspaper has told the public something they should know and have a right to know about the full nature of public policy. Immigration policy is an area where confidentiality has little place. The public must be kept fully informed of the activities and deliberations of their parliamentary representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> To try to form immigration policy in secrecy is a sure prescription for fear and paranoia. This question of breach of privilege would not have arisen in the first place if the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations had adopted a more open procedure. Closed meetings and confidential documents are surely, as everyone in this building knows, a fiction. History proves that over and over again. All it does is serve to keep the general public in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the annoyance of the Committee but I think that it has acted hastily and it is even appearing to be petulant in this matter. It is continuing to conduct what looks like a witch-hunt. It only reinforces the impression of the public that public policy on immigration is being made in a clandestine manner. It is certainly not in the public interest. </PARA>

Simply, he wishes to send a matter to the Privileges Committee and I ask that it look at something in addition. I in no way negate his motion. I simply amend it with this additional matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was indicating that the matter that I believe should be sent to the Committee has been canvassed by me previously. In asking your opinion, Mr Speaker, I proffered all relevant details known to me about the matter. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that when I raised the matter I refrained from moving a motion. </PARA>
<PARA> After duly considering the matter, on 23 August, pursuant to standing order 96 you delivered your opinion on the matter, stating that a prima facie case had not been made out and as a consequence you were not prepared to give precedence to a motion under that standing order. </PARA>
<PARA> You will recall further, Mr Speaker, that at the time you delivered your opinion, whilst respecting the conclusion you had reached, I indicated that I would be looking at the matter to see whether it could be taken further. Accordingly, I have now moved this amendment in the terms mentioned to allow for the matter to be considered by the Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my submission that having regard to the nature of the allegations made in the article in question the best forum at this juncture to resolve the matter is through the deliberations of the Committee of Privileges with a view to the Committee reporting to this House so that the House can then determine whether a breach of privilege has been made out. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this submission there are three matters that I wish to address. First, in giving your reasons, Mr Speaker, in support of your opinion that a prima facie case had not been made out, you made reference to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which provides that a complaint will not constitute a breach of privilege unless the conduct in question `amounts, or is intended or is likely to amount, to an improper interference . . . with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member'. In that context you stated, Mr Speaker, that to the best of your knowledge there was no evidence that the article in question had obstructed or interfered with the proper operation of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect, the words of section 4 are wider than that. I particularly refer to the phrase `likely to amount' appearing in that section. This phrase imports an objective test which in the circumstances does not for the purposes of standing order 96 require the production of any concrete evidence that such an interference has taken place, hence the words `likely to amount to'. It is my submission that taken on their face the only conclusion that can be reached is that these allegations, if they remain unanswered, are `likely to amount' to an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, a case touching upon section 4 was raised recently with you in a complaint by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). After considering the provisions of section 4 and the nature of the complaint raised you indicated that the honourable member had raised a `borderline case' and then went on to say that this House `would benefit from the advice of the Committee of Privileges'. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the gravity and enormity of the allegations I raised that there was some complicity in a murder by a member of the Cabinet and that a journalist had talked with witnesses about this matter, what a contrast between the matter that has been referred to the Privileges Committee and the matter that I have brought into the House. Really and truly, a letter from a solicitor to a member is prima facie, at this juncture, viewed as improper. Ipso facto I could walk outside this House and defame someone. The person could understandably have a solicitor write a letter to me and that, to date, would be interpreted as improper. But if the fact that a journalist writes that there is a person who has been an accessory to or committed a murder and that he has talked with the witnesses ranks even less than a mere solicitor's letter, then it seems to me there is either something wrong in the determinations to date or something strange and rotten in the state of Denmark. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter which I wish to address is the relevance of section 6 of the same Act. In delivering your opinion, Mr Speaker, you quite rightly pointed out that the effect of this provision is that the species of defamatory contempt which once occupied much of the business of this House and the House of Commons had been abolished. In other words, a statement which is only-I emphasise the word `only'-defamatory may not constitute a contempt of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a point that I clearly acknowledged when I raised this matter on 21 August. At the time I went on to give reasons as to why I hold the view that the allegations in question amount to more than merely defamatory or critical comments and therefore fall outside the ambit of section 6. Indeed you yourself, Mr Speaker, acknowledged that these allegations `may not only be defamatory, they also imply a most serious charge'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had an opportunity of consulting the report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege to which I earlier referred. Paragraphs 6.14 and 6.21 discuss the rationale behind the recommendation that defamatory contempts be abolished. In making this recommendation the Committee was of the view that ordinarily where defamatory comments have been made which would constitute a contempt of Parliament there will be other means of redress available and in this respect noted some examples. </PARA>
<PARA> First, identified members who are the subject of defamatory statements will have recourse to civil litigation. Second, identified members will have other means of satisfaction such as the right of rebuttal or correction within Parliament or the making of complaints to the Australian Press Council. Third, as a 'last resort', certain provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 may be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching its conclusions, the Joint Select Committee did not consider the problem of allegations being made against unidentified members of parliament. In such a case there simply is no alternative means of redress available. It is therefore my submission that this particular case clearly falls outside the intended ambit of section 6. </PARA>
<PARA> In delivering an opinion on this, Mr Speaker, you quite rightly pointed out that there must be something more to the allegations besides mere criticism or defamatory comments. This point was not overlooked by the Joint Select Committee. It noted that where a matter-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . constitutes intimidation or attempted intimidation, full power to deal with such a matter as a contempt would remain. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the Committee's words, not mine: full power would remain in such circumstances. It is my submission that these allegations do constitute an attempted intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I wish to address, Mr Speaker, is your comment that the appropriate body to deal with this matter would be the police. Unfortunately, the brief history of this matter indicates that this may not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I will briefly recount the sequence of events. Immediately after these allegations were made, the Government suggested-through the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), as I recall, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-that the author should provide the relevant information to the Australian Federal Police or the National Crime Authority. In response, the author indicated that to the best of his knowledge the authorities were aware of the matter and had the necessary information should they wish properly to investigate it. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that, the National Crime Authority and the Federal Police indicated that they had no information linking an unnamed Federal Cabinet Minister to an alleged murder. In addition, both authorities stated that they were not investigating the allegations made by Mr Burton. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that this is a matter for the police, the Speaker of the House says that it is a matter for the police, but the police force does nothing about it. The Attorney does not even get on the phone-and I know that he has some limited powers in this arena-and even suggest, as is his right, that Government policy in favour of law enforcement might require at least a telephone call to the journalist, if not a discussion with him about the witnesses with whom he has discussed the matter. I realise that the restrictions on the Attorney are such that he cannot direct the police as such, but he can tell them what Government policy is, which I assume until this incident became public was in favour of law enforcement. It takes a touch of exquisite genius to say, `I am in favour of law enforcement but I don't want the police to interview anybody'. A simple interview is all that is needed, and even that is not transpiring. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, Mr Speaker, whether a breach of privilege or a contempt of parliament has been made out is not for me, you or the Attorney to decide; it is a matter for this House. It is my submission that it is only after the Committee of Privileges has investigated and considered the matter that the House will be in a position to make such a determination. To put it mildly, it is an outrage that a journalist can write that the defamation laws alone prevent him from naming a Cabinet Minister who was involved with a Mr Big in a murder, that no-one on the other side of the chamber wants to do anything about it, and that the Committee of Privileges, which is charged with looking at some solicitor's letter, is not even deemed appropriate to look at whether this is contemptible, in contempt or in breach of the Parliament in any way at all. It is quite an outrage. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that if all the law and any of the elements that I have referred to here are excluded, one thing-if one possesses it-will lead one to an inevitable conclusion, and that is simple common sense. The fact that an allegation has been made that a Cabinet Minister has been involved, in one form or another, in a murder which ought not be investigated will lead one solely to the conclusion that the Committee of Privileges should be looking at this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> As you have sought guidance on the term `improper', Mr Speaker, in circumstances where a solicitor acting for an allegedly aggrieved person could be deemed to have acted improperly, in terms of gravity surely the circumstances that I put before the House must exceed that issue by very great moment. We cannot pass over the allegation that a member of the Cabinet may have been involved in, or after the fact of, murder where the journalist claims he has spoken to witnesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) to the proposition moved by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). There was a call by the honourable gentleman who has just spoken for common sense. It would be useful to apply a little here when we consider the authority and role of the Committee of Privileges in what constitutes something likely to amount to improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions and the very relevant restrictions entailed in section 6 (1).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we can argue here by way of analogy, if I were to take the honourable member for Kooyong out into a public place and shoot him dead, on the matter of common sense does anybody seriously wonder whether it would be a matter for the Privileges Committee or for the police? If I were to do that, there would be no doubt in the mind of any other member of the House that a proposition would not be moved in this place that my behaviour ought to be referred to the Privileges Committee to see whether or not that constituted improper interference, even though quite manifestly it would in those circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would constitute a dramatic and improper interference by me of the honourable member's capacity to carry out his duty. But the remedy that would be sought in that instance would be by reference to the police force. If I did something further than that and took any member of the general public outside the precincts of the Parliament and shot him dead, when this matter was duly reported by the media in the press gallery that I had done that and that it ought to be a matter for investigation, would it seriously be considered by anyone here that there had been improper interference with some member's capacity to carry out his duty without interference or that that matter should be investigated by the police? There is a simple answer to that, too. It would never enter into the minds of anyone, either inside this Parliament or outside it, that the most sensible course of action for us to pursue would be that the Committee of Privileges ought to look at my behaviour in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if I were suspected of doing it and I was seen leaving the crime, obviously that would not be a matter that, sensibly, would be before the Committee of Privileges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong contrasted his particular areas of concern in that article with the situation raised by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I quite agree with him that the offence of murder certainly must be ranked ahead of that of defamation, libel or whatever. If that were the only matter that ought to be considered or the criteria by which things were referred to the Parliamentary Committee of Privileges-that is, the level of offence, its seriousness or whatever-he would have a case. The point about the position of the honourable member for Corio which you, Mr Speaker, considered marginal but nevertheless something that might be usefully considered by the Committee, was that it concerned a lawyer's letter to him suggesting that comments that he had made were defamatory of the lawyer's client and that if he persisted in making those comments, action would be taken, and asking him to desist. </PARA>
<PARA> As you said, Mr Speaker, that is a marginal case. We do not have star chamber rights in this place or in our constituencies. Nevertheless, quite obviously there is more of a case to be made with regard to the question of interference with a member's capacity to act than is entailed here. Where, in the particular article to which the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) refers, is there an element to it, either directly or indirectly, which calls into question the capacity of any member of parliament to function effectively in this place? Where in it is there any element of intimidation of a member of parliament to undertake a particular course of action other than he would exercise in his own free will and judgment? There is none, of course. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, that element must be present. I refer to the relevant sections of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987. Firstly, the overriding section, section 4, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. </PARA>
<PARA>How does the existence of that report constitute something which is likely to amount to an improper interference of duties? Which particular member of the Cabinet-no individual is named-what element of the Cabinet acting collectively, what particular performance by individual Cabinet members in their capacity as members of the House is interfered with by the allegations contained in that letter? If the Australian Federal Police do not have information on this matter-and I understand from what the honourable gentleman said they do not-then, clearly, there is an obligation on anyone who thinks he knows anything about the matter and who considers it a matter for federal jurisdiction to present it to the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA> If the matter has been presented to other police forces and they have chosen to act or not to act on it, then it is a matter for those police forces. Presumably, they do so exercising a judgment about the validity of what it is that has been handed to them. There are enough wild allegations in politics for us not necessarily to jump at every particular item that comes up and decide that the matter has to be viewed with great seriousness. There is, of course, an obligation on a police force, if evidence is presented to it, to act in connection with the materials that have been handed to it. Given that no action has been taken, or at least none as far as we know, then that may be as a result of the fact that the police think that none ought to be taken. Whether they choose to act or not, as far as this House is concerned, the question is obviously not a matter of privilege. It may well be a matter for condemning police forces or being upset about the state of justice in our community today, but it is not a matter for the Parliamentary Privileges Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 6 (1) of the Act, as amended in 1987, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against a House by reason only that those words or acts are defamatory or critical of the Parliament, a House, a committee or a member. </PARA>
<PARA>That decisively removes from any sensible consideration of the Privileges Committee the proposition that the honourable member for Kooyong has raised. The Privileges Committee will have its hands full trying to work out what it is that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has a grievance about. It will also have to consider the matters raised by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in relation to the hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. It may well be that in any person's reasonable judgment about what constitutes an offence, if an offence has indeed occurred that constitutes a particularly sinful or heinous act, that person would come to a conclusion that if there was any truth in the story to which the honourable member for Kooyong refers, it would be worse than either of the issues that concern the honourable member for Calwell and the honourable member for Corio. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised by those honourable members are not matters for the police forces. One relates to the conduct of a committee of the House and the other to the conduct of a member of the House. They are matters to be considered by the Privileges Committee. This matter is clearly a matter for the police. If the honourable member for Kooyong feels that he has some useful information about this that he would like to present to the police, he so should do so and cease wasting the time of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply briefly to the comments of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) in this discussion. The honourable member stated that the processes of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations are not open and public. The honourable member is new to this House. He is probably not aware that this Standing Committee is the first standing committee on migration established by this House. It has published a lot of material, much of which, unfortunately, has not been taken up by the media. If there is a desire for a public debate on immigration, then a lot of the public evidence and a lot of the public material ought to be taken up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The overwhelming proportion of material coming before the Committee is not confidential. So, I would say that the impression the honourable member for North Sydney tried to create, that, in fact, the committee was hiding something, is quite false. Whether or not a submission is to be treated as confidential is determined by all the members of the Committee, who represent all political parties in both chambers of this Parliament. The honourable member for North Sydney should be aware that a determination was made in this case, not only because of the sensitivity of the material, but also because it was part of the request which was made by the group wishing to present the evidence to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member said that no reasons were given in the report I presented to the House yesterday. That is not correct. Yesterday, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee feels that the article published in the Sunday Herald of 16 September 1990 is of a much more serious nature and has the potential to undermine the Committee's future deliberations, especially in its dealings with third parties. This is particularly so when information either sought or provided is done so on a confidential basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee is therefore deeply concerned that a senior journalist, who either knew or ought to have known the serious nature of publishing a document which was forwarded to the Committee on a confidential basis or material which was provided during the course of an in camera hearing to the Committee should subsequently publish such material or extracts from such material. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a very serious matter. The honourable member for North Sydney has asked why any material on immigration should be confidential. It is quite clear that there are many instances where material is determined to be confidential because it refers to individual cases, or because, in the opinion of the Committee, even if it refers to more general matters, it would be easy to identify the person giving the material. Other parliamentary committees, as well as this one, often take the view that such material ought to be presented in confidence so that committee members can have an overall appreciation of the matter. I reject the honourable member's argument. I urge the House to support the original motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the amendment (Mr Peacock's) be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill amends a number of Acts administered within my portfolio and other related Acts. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and corrections to existing legislation. None of the amendments concerns major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum. I propose to confine my remarks to the more noteworthy aspects of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 2-Amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for improvements to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 which follow up the reforms to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) work force last year. These include changes to the review and appeal process designed to extend rights of review in a way which will enhance efforts to make the AFP a more unified work force. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer will the right to review only apply within the same stream of appointment. In cases where a vacancy is advertised to be filled by either a police member or a non-police staff member it will be possible for a police member to seek a review of the promotion even if the vacancy is filled by a non-police staff member. The same rights will also apply if the vacancy is filled by a police member and a non-police staff member wants to seek a review. This change accords with the policy of promotion by merit and will bolster progress towards implementation of a unified work force. These policies are a key feature of employment within the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> This aspect of the Bill is another step in the process which is transforming the AFP into one of the more advanced government work forces. The new work force is designed to encourage a multi-disciplined approach to law enforcement. The Government has recognised that in a world where methods used by criminals are increasingly sophisticated, the nation's premier law enforcement body must be efficient and capable of fully utilising the talents of all its personnel. Establishment of a system of staff selection which is efficient and fair to all personnel is an important element in encouraging the development of a committed and fully utilised work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also underpin the capacity of the Minister responsible for the AFP and an administrator of an external Territory to enter into an arrangement for the AFP to police Territory laws. It will give the AFP functions, powers and duties in relation to those laws where an arrangement has been signed. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 3-Amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the Cash Transaction Reports Act requires cash dealers to report suspicious transactions to the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. The Act contains a very strict regime for the secrecy of the information so supplied. Under subsection 16(4), where a cash dealer has lodged a suspect transaction report, only the Director or `a relevant authority' as defined may require the cash dealer to provide further information. Clause 21 amends the definition of `relevant authority' to include a reference to the Australian Customs Service. Provision is made for access to information by the Australian Customs Service in other parts of the Act. However, by an oversight, the Australian Customs Service was not included as a `relevant authority' in section 16. This is remedied by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 3 also amends the Act to take account of the pending change of name of the New South Wales State Drug Crime Commission to the Crime Commission of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 4-Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 4 amends the interpretative provisions of the Crimes Act and these changes are discussed in the explanatory memorandum. However, more importantly, it replaces section 76 of the Act-Obstructing, et cetera, public officers. The amendment precludes any adverse consequences which may flow from the decision of the South Australian Supreme Court in Austin v. Parsons (1986) 83 FLR 402 which sought to give a very narrow interpretation to the section. The new section is based largely upon that recommended by the Gibbs Committee in its recent interim report Principles of Criminal Responsibility and Other Matters. The new provision will apply only to conduct after commencement of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 5 and Schedule 1-Amendments to the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a party to a number of international conventions, including the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation. These conventions deal with the problems associated with the disruption of international civil aviation by terrorism, hijacking, personal acts of violence, acts endangering the safety of aircraft in flight, and the destruction of, or interference with, aviation facilities. Part 5 of the Bill amends the Crimes (Protection of Aircraft) Act 1973 to create the offences necessary to give effect to the protocol of the Montreal Convention. The protocol supplements the Convention, to which Australia and 136 other states are already parties, and is an important instrument designed to safeguard the safety of airports serving international civil aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the Bill makes it an offence for a person to unlawfully and intentionally perform an act of violence against a person at, or to disrupt the services of, an international airport. It is also an offence to damage the facilities of, or to damage any aircraft not in service located on, such an airport. In all cases it is necessary that the act endanger, or be likely to endanger, safety at that airport. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 6-Amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 6 amends the Director of Public Prosecutions Act in order to create a separate statutory office of Associate Director. The need to create this position stems from the gradual extension of the statutory functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) since 1984. In March 1984 the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was primarily a prosecution agency with only a limited civil remedies function. However, since then, the civil remedies have been expanded and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 confers on the office a leading role in the confiscation of the proceeds of crime. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, additional powers have been conferred on the Director since the establishment of the Office. The Director is now empowered to sign ex officio indictments and to grant transactional indemnities against prosecution, powers that were previously exercised only by the Attorney-General. The Associate Director will be able to exercise all of the powers of the Director except the Director's power of delegation under section 31. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the power of the DPP to give a use/derivative use indemnity in relation to evidence to be given in a broader range of State or Territory proceedings. If a person is to give evidence in a State or Territory proceeding, and that evidence may disclose the involvement of the witness in the commission of a Commonwealth offence, the Commonwealth DPP may give an undertaking that the evidence, and any further evidence that is derivative of it, will not be used against the witness in Commonwealth proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will also ensure that the Director has such powers where the State or Territory proceeding is a coronial inquest or a proceeding before a body such as the New South Wales State Drug Crime Commission or the Independent Commission Against Corruption which is prescribed by regulation for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 7-Amendments of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Proceeds of Crime Act is being amended to pave the way for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to enact its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminal assets. At present the Proceeds of Crime Act applies to indictable offences against a law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. `Territory' is defined to include the Australian Capital Territory. As a result, where a person is convicted of an indictable offence against the criminal law of the ACT any related confiscation proceedings are taken under the Commonwealth Act and any recoveries are paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT has indicated that it proposes enacting its own legislation dealing with the confiscation of criminally derived assets. In anticipation of this the Bill amends the definitions of `State' and `Territory' so that the ACT, like the Northern Territory, is treated as a State and the Commonwealth Act will cease to apply to offences against the laws of the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The transitional arrangements are that the Commonwealth Act will continue to apply to any case in which action under the Commonwealth Act has already been taken at the commencement date. For example, if a monitoring order has been made, a search warrant has been issued or a restraining order has been granted in relation to a particular matter, all subsequent proceedings in relation to that matter will be taken under the Commonwealth Act notwithstanding the amendments made by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 8-Amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception)</PARA>
<PARA>Act 1979</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Part 8 of the Bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. None of the amendments extends the interception powers under the Act. However, these amendments will facilitate the efficient operation of the Act and resolve a number of administrative difficulties in the operation of the Act as it affects law enforcement agencies. It may assist the House if I outline the major administrative and operational difficulties which the Bill addresses. </PARA>
<PARA> A warrant issued under section 48 of the Act authorises both the installation and use of equipment to intercept communications on premises if the judge is satisfied that interception would be impracticable or inappropriate otherwise than by using such equipment. `Equipment' is defined for the purposes of the Act, and that definition specifically excludes a `line' which is also defined for the purposes of the Act. The use of a line may in fact be necessary in an interception under a section 48 warrant, and an unintended consequence of the definition of `equipment' is to exclude expressly the use of a line. The Bill will remedy this defect. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsection 60(1) of the Act requires the chief officer of an agency to which a warrant has been issued to cause the managing director of the relevant telecommunications carrier to be given a certified copy of the warrant forthwith. It is necessary to be able to locate a certifying officer as quickly as possible so that the necessary copy can be certified before the original warrant is forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for execution. The present definition of `certifying officer' has caused administrative difficulties because of the small number of persons able to certify a copy as being a true copy of the original. Only two persons fall within the definition in the New South Wales Police Force, and in Sydney, where applications by the NCA are usually made, there is only one member of the National Crime Authority who may certify copies. The new definition of `prescribed officer' in the Bill will extend the number of persons who are able to certify a warrant as being a true copy for the purposes of subsection 60(1), by including assistant commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and officers of the police force of a State of equivalent rank, and an authorised member of the staff of the Senior Executive Service of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Under section 79 of the Act, the chief officer of each agency is required to destroy information obtained from a lawful interception when the chief officer is satisfied that it is no longer needed for a permitted purpose. At present, the permitted purposes specified in the Act are nearly all matters connected with the investigation and prosecution of crimes. The Bill extends the definition of `permitted purpose' so that the chief officer is able to retain records, in the form of the number called by a target service, which may be used to comply with the record keeping provisions in part VIII of the Act. I should stress that information used for this purpose will not include the content of conversations. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsections 81(1) and (2) of the Act require the Commissioner of the AFP and the Chairman of the NCA respectively to cause specified particulars and statements to be recorded in writing as soon as practicable after the happening of the events to which the information relates. In fact the recording of information by both agencies is computerised. Since some doubt whether the use of the expression `in writing' authorises the recording of the information by computer, the amendments made to subsections 81(1) and (2) by the Bill will enable this information to be recorded by means of a computer. </PARA>
<PARA> In the preparation of the first annual report of the Minister under division 2 of part X of the Act, it became apparent that the obligation imposed by subsection 94(3) on the Commissioner of the AFP and the Chairman of the NCA to provide information to be included in the ministerial report within two months after 30 June may in certain circumstances be impossible if all the information required by paragraphs l0l (l) (b) and (d) were included. Those paragraphs refer to an assessment of the average time for which warrants applied for during the relevant year were in force. Given that warrants may be issued for periods of up to three months, such an assessment could not be made if a warrant issued in the final month of the year under report remains in force more than two months into the new year. A similar amendment to section 35 will allow the complementary State legislation to be amended so that it also provides a three-month period for the provision of information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes a number of consequential amendments to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act following the change of name of the State Drug Crime Commission of New South Wales to the New South Wales Crime Commission and makes changes to correct minor drafting errors which were made in previous amendments to provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 9 and Schedule 2-Amendments to Other Acts</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enhance the efficiency of the National Crime Authority by enabling it to assemble and give evidence directly to the prosecuting authority. At present such material must be given to the Attorney-General or a law enforcement agency. This change was recommended by the InterGovernmental Committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The second schedule to the Bill amends certain Acts to ensure that the Commonwealth retains full and effective control over the substantive elements of legislation which currently apply ACT laws for certain purposes. For example, several Commonwealth Acts apply ACT law in some external Territories or to activities aboard aircraft. However, on 1 July 1990 the ACT Government took over responsibility for criminal laws of the Territory. As a result, if the Commonwealth wished to amend the law applied by these enactments, it would have to specifically amend each of these Acts. I regard this position as unsatisfactory and as Jervis Bay Territory laws are currently the same as ACT laws but are subject to the ordinance making power of the Governor-General, I propose that Jervis Bay law be the law applied by these Acts. These amendments will mean that where the Commonwealth amends by ordinance the ACT law operating in Jervis Bay this will flow through automatically to other applied law regimes without the need for separate amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of those external territories which are currently subject to ACT laws the amendments will apply Jervis Bay Territory criminal laws but continue to apply ACT civil laws. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the AFP Act and the consequential amendments and the amendments to the NCA Act will have only a minor financial impact. It is not anticipated that the other measures proposed in the Bill will occasion any increased costs to the Commonwealth. I table the explanatory memorandum for this Bill, and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this discussion of the appropriations for the Department of Transport and Communications it would be very tempting to continue the examination that the House and the country have been conducting in recent times on the blood-letting that is going on in the Labor Party as it struggles its way towards finding some consensus-which is the fashionable word-on telecommunications reform. However, it is probably more appropriate to devote the time that we have available in the debate to look at a few specific matters that I wish to raise, bearing in mind the basic proposition that we make, which is that the Government has not committed itself to the real reform which is necessary in telecommunications in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is appropriate, as I say, to look at a few specific matters in order to throw some light on them. The first matter relates to rural and remote areas. It is particularly instructive to look at this area because one of the major arguments advanced by those who are opposed to reform in the telecommunications area these days is that the present system and, indeed, the very modest and moderate reforms the Government proposes, will benefit people in rural and remote areas. It is said that the monopoly by Telecom Australia should be retained because it gives a good deal to people in rural and remote areas. That, to some extent, is a myth. Indeed, it cannot be said that people in rural and remote areas always obtain a very good deal under the present system. We would maintain that people in those areas can reasonably expect an even better service and, indeed, a more reasonable price fixing regime under the sorts of reforms that we have proposed. But the point is that they do not do very well under the present system, and the example I wish to give, which I hope the Government will take up and investigate, will illustrate that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received representations passed on to me by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) with respect to one of his constituents who has been charged $1,450, if you please, for a rural connection fee. This has come about as the rural and remote area program is advanced. The representations by the honourable member for Maranoa have highlighted the point that because the township in Queensland to which he refers now falls under the rural and remote area program by virtue of the digital radio concentrator system, anyone wanting a new service connection, or who moves from one house to a new location in the town, is required to pay a rural connection fee. The honourable member points out that, in this case, the fee charged by Telecom was $1,450. Of course, this concerns a person who lives in a remote area who is being told that the present system benefits him. The way in which the present system has had an impact on him is that he has been required to pay $1,450 for this basic connection. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom's defence-and the matter has been taken up with Telecom-is that firstly, the charge is not excessive and, secondly, that it is not excessive when compared to the development of an automatic telecommunications system in more remote areas. Thirdly, in its letter of reply Telecom states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . rural connection fees do not reflect the actual capital costs of delivering automatic telephone services and are considerably cross-subsidised by customers located within the more densely populated metropolitan and provincial cities and towns. </PARA>
<PARA>The point should be made clearly, fairly and squarely that the present system and the way in which it has an impact on people in country areas is not a system that enables them to get cheap telecommunication services. It may be that the representative of Telecom who has replied to these representations is literally correct when he says `Well, it is cheaper than it could have been', but we would maintain that the rural and remote user is, under the present system of telecommunications in Australia, not getting as good a deal or as good a service as technology can justify him or her receiving. We believe that reforms, technological progress and the general approach to telecommunications that we in the Opposition have advocated are such that those in country districts can reasonably expect an even better service and lower prices. We would hope that that matter would be looked at because we maintain that the rural connection fees under the rural and remote area program are, in fact, far too high and that technological progress and sensible administration could and should result in lower charges being imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the role of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and bring before the Committee some representations which have been made to me concerning the radio station JJJ, which is a youth FM network which the ABC provides. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague has said, in fact far fewer people may listen to this station than some people would maintain. I must confess that, except on very rare occasions, I have not listened to this station. The point is that some people do and, of course, it is a part of the cost structure of the ABC. It costs a lot of money to run. The people who have made representations state in their letter that they are concerned about `unpopular changes (especially the sudden, unexpected dismissals) at ABC radio station JJJ'. The letter further states that JJJ was recently expanded into what is described as a `national youth network'. The letter goes on to state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . yet popular and experienced announcers were almost immediately suspended from their duties, replaced by other announcers and left to languish idly, still in the employ of the ABC (one presumes on full pay). </PARA>
<PARA>We make the point that this service is supported by appropriations from the Budget and it is absurd if, within that expensive structure, the administration is such that people are not being used in a productive manner. We urge the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to see exactly how this money is being appropriated. We urge him to see whether there is waste and whether the administration is being run smoothly and efficiently to make sure that we, as taxpayers, get value for our dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn from that matter to another concerning the ABC. It has been brought to my notice that it has been alleged-and, of course, I cannot vouch for this personally-that the General Manager of Radio Australia, Mr Broinowski, has wended his way to Vietnam `to seek out and offer employment to three Vietnamese broadcasters to work in the Vietnamese section of Radio Australia', in the words of the representations. The point is being made that Vietnamese people in Australia have both the background and the experience to fill these positions and should be given an opportunity to fill them. Those people are already here. We do not have to go to the expense of bringing them to Australia and establishing them here. Why cannot we advertise and retain people here rather than going to the additional expense of recruiting them in Vietnam? Members of the Vietnamese community in Australia are very concerned about this trend and regard it as something of a slight. We ask the Minister to examine this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, with respect to Radio Australia, we are frankly amazed that the ABC has announced today that it has abandoned, at least temporarily, the proposal to develop the south bank project. Apparently it has not been abandoned entirely, but it has been put on hold or, to use the ABC's words, suspended indefinitely. I hope I have the opportunity of elaborating on this at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise at a fairly historic moment in the development of the telecommunications debate in Australia because I think it is quite likely that next Monday the national conference of the Australian Labor Party will agree to a number of changes in policy which open up opportunities for Australia to play a stronger and more prominent role in telecommunications, both domestically and internationally, with particular reference to the South East Asian basin.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member opposite asks me whether I am optimistic. I do not think so. I am quietly confident that the decision taken by our Party will provide the Government with scope to do a number of things in its objectives. Historically no-one in government has taken a more serious approach towards the provision of telecommunications which are responsive to the marketplace and growing world needs. I noticed during Question Time today that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) referred to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) in his last role in the Fraser Government as the Minister for Communications. His very last statement in that role was to encourage the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) to block the things that he is now espousing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last seven years this Government has taken the telecommunications issue and worked its way, first of all, through a few legacies-not the least of which is Aussat Pty Ltd. In particular, via the process of the 1988 review, it has positioned Telecom Australia, as the national carrier for domestic telecommunications, to be the organisation that we want it to become in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me start with a couple of points in defence of Telecom. At the moment, by all world measuring parameters, Telecom is a very good organisation. It is at the leading edge of technological development. It has certainly managed to provide, across a large continent, telecom-munications services to ordinary people at prices and at a level of reliability which are, by world standards, very good. </PARA>
<PARA> We think Telecom has lacked a bit, particularly in the area of customer service and responsiveness to changing market trends. That is why, in the process which led up to and included the 1988 review, the add-on or value added services such as the small business systems, PABXs, commander systems and so on were opened up to competition. But, for those who preach competition as the be-all and end-all, it ought to be noted that many of the suppliers of equipment in the marketplace now contract Telecom to provide the work-to install the equipment and maintain it for them on service contracts. Via a process of management change, introduction of more customer sensitive techniques and more professionalism within the fields of customer service, Telecom has begun to match its technical excellence with a changed attitude to the ordinary customer. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one experiences this change more than the ordinary member of parliament in his or her electorate office. Prior to 1988 I would guess that at least 20 to 30 per cent of the calls to my office were from people who were unhappy with Telecom about some matter or other. That ratio now is very low. I would hazard a guess that less than 5 per cent of calls to my office are now about Telecom's customer relations. That to me is a very clear signal that Telecom's act has been smartened up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to deal at the local level, but as Telecom has at least changed its operations to satisfy the existing customer base, and is succeeding in satisfying that customer base, it is now positioning itself to do much more. It is the `much more' that I want to talk about in the next few minutes available to me. </PARA>
<PARA> We will wait to see what the national conference of the Australian Labor Party brings forward, but with the proposal to merge OTC Ltd and Telecom we are opening up the prospect of that merged organisation having a world perspective. We in this country are positioned at the forefront of providing telecommunications, particularly to the Asia-Pacific Basin and hubbing many of those facilities in this part of the world through Australia-not only in technical terms but also in terms of our people and our relationships with people in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is seen by many-for instance, in Europe-as the logical place from which to bring forward these developments. I say particularly to honourable members opposite that a few weeks ago I met with a senior executive in Singapore who asked me a question about our policy towards multiculturalism. Even though on this side of the House that whole White Australia thing has been pretty well put to bed, and we are doing our best to explain to people in our part of the world that we are a multicultural nation and do not have all these hang-ups any more, they still think that we do. Unfortunately this is still influencing people's attitudes about whether they ought to enter into these kinds of business relationships with us. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason such people still think we have a White Australia policy is that those on the other side of the House, particularly in the lead-up to the last election, had one final fling. The multifunction polis debate and the policies that came out of Future Directions unfortunately left a bad taste that we now have to dispel once more. The great benefit of that last election was that it was the final wash-out. I doubt whether in the future even the Opposition will bring forward these sorts of ideas to present to the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of that assurance, I hope that people in the region will see us having the same potential because we are positioning the organisations with the people with skills and with a revised attitude towards getting out into in the market. We are giving them a new charter to act cooperatively between each other rather than against each other. That is the final observation I make, Mr Deputy Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia at the moment we have this crazy situation where our three national carriers in telecommunications-Telecom, OTC and Aussat-have to operate within certain boundaries. They are not allowed to work in certain areas and they are not allowed to compete against each other. However, they have no charter to work together and actually develop the industry together. The lack of that charter has meant that some very silly things have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> So whatever happens in the reform, it will bring these operations together. It will set up an alternative form for the provision of services and in the process it will define a new role for Aussat-one which will widen its footprint, base and the range of services available in the community. This will be well received by the Australian public in general. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise at this stage of the committee debate to speak more specifically about the transport area and in particular, of course, the areas relating to the portfolio that I represent on behalf of the Opposition; that is, the portfolio of shipping and waterfront reform. It is a very topical portfolio because the Government has claimed as one of the shining lights of its micro-economic reform performance the performance that it is getting out of the waterfront-the great deal of reform that is occurring there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, both the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the past few weeks have said that this is an example of what the Labor Party can do as far as micro- economic reform is concerned, and that this is really creating the credentials for the Labor Government in this very vital area of economic management. So if this is the case then it is worth while studying the Budget Papers, and in particular the appropriations which are being allocated by Parliament to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), to see precisely what is going on in terms of the performance of micro-economic reform in both the waterfront and our shipping services. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that on 1 June last year, the Government, after some six years of having committees, inquiries and goodness only knows what, finally came down with the decision that it would implement the reform of our waterfront. The Government created a body known as the Water Industry Reform Authority, commonly called WIRA, which was given a budget. The budget was for the purposes of making payments to waterside workers to get those waterside workers to accept redundancy payments so that they would leave the waterside in order to reduce the numbers of people working on the waterfront and to get the levels of efficiency up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government set its goal of having a 30 per cent increase in productivity levels over the next three years. In order to achieve that, the Government allocated some $300m to be paid to about 3,000 retiring waterside workers. Half of the money was to come from the taxpayer; the other half was to come from the employers of waterfront labour, that is, stevedores. Ultimately, all of the money-the $300m-would come from either the Australian taxpayers or consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> So $300m paid to 3,000 waterside workers averages out at around $100,000 per waterside worker. All of these waterside workers had to be aged 55 years or older in order to be eligible, and the process was implemented late last year. To see exactly the degree of pace of reform on the waterfront, one can go to the Budget Papers delivered a few short weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> By comparing how much was actually allocated in the Budget to be paid to retiring waterside workers for work practice reform on the waterfront with the actual amount of money that was spent in paying out waterside workers, one can actually measure the pace of reform that is being achieved by this Government on the waterfront. The Government had allocated some $39,969,000-about $40m-to be spent by it this year in productivity gains on the waterfront. That was the amount that was actually allocated for expenditure. The amount the Government actually expended was some $9,327,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So less than one-quarter of the money that was allocated for expenditure to achieve gains in productivity on our waterfront was expended. That set of figures clearly reveals that the pace of reform on the waterfront is moving at less than 25 per cent of what the Government had hoped to be able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder, looking at the way in which the entire WIRA process has been established, that the people setting the reform processes are none other than the stevedores and the trade unions, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Government? All of them have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. The trade union involved, the Waterside Workers Federation, is doing what all trade unions do in circumstances where reform is required; it negotiates, it negotiates, it negotiates. It negotiates to the point where nothing is gained, time is expended and ultimately years have passed by. Either the zeal for reform has expired or panic has set into the government and the government finally throws the towel in because it cannot get anywhere. So this is what is happening on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> The shipping industry is somewhat similar. The shipping industry has achieved some greater pace of reform than the waterfront. A great deal of credit has to go to Pat Geraghty of the Seamen's Union of Australia. Pat Geraghty is one of the most outstanding trade unionists in this country, simply because he delivers what he says he will deliver, which is distinctly different from a lot of other people who operate in the trade union industry. He is also notable for the fact that he has recognised there is a need to make change within the shipping industry. To that end we have seen the crewing levels on board Australian flagships come down from the thirties into the low twenties, with further changes to take place over the next few years to bring those levels down into the high teens. These are real reforms, and credit should be given where credit is due-to the Government, the employers of seamen and the Seamen's Union led by Pat Geraghty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that whilst the actual numbers of crew required to run a ship have come down, there has not been a significant change in the number of crew per berth on board a ship. At present, Australian flag vessels operate with about 2.4, 2.5 crew per berth on board a ship, as opposed to the international standard of around about 1.6 crew per berth on board a ship. That means that we need to employ more sailors per ship to keep that ship operating. Whilst that differential between the standard of other shipping nations and the Australian shipping nation is maintained, we will never achieve international efficiency levels within our Australian shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is worth pointing out that the savings that have been achieved by reducing the numbers of people on board vessels have been considerable. Whilst they have been considerable, it is worth also noting that in the past few weeks of the Parliament, the Government has introduced a new piece of legislation to create yet another statutory authority called the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA). It has been the subject of some controversy in the last week or so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was going to Newcastle, as the honourable member for Fadden points out. Indeed, it has caused a great deal of heartburn in Newcastle because the Government has broken another one of its promises to the Newcastle people. It decided last Friday that, despite all of the promises of delivering AMSA to Newcastle, it would renege on that promise and AMSA would be established in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the Minister who introduced the legislation, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), only a couple of weeks ago said in the Parliament that if the Opposition had become the Government and had taken advantage of the opportunity to reverse the decision to locate AMSA in Newcastle, it would have been an act of vindictiveness against Newcastle and against the people of Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite that comment of the Minister for Land Transport that we would be the ones who would reverse the decision and locate AMSA in some place other than Newcastle-he said that would be the nastiest and most vindictive act ever seen-guess who decided to not locate AMSA in Newcastle? It was the Labor Government itself and, using the words of the Minister, that must be seen as an act of vindictiveness against Newcastle and against the people of Newcastle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does represent the area and is severely embarrassed by it. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) is also severely embarrassed by all of this. In fact, he was on radio 2KO, the local Newcastle radio station, during the week. It was fascinating to listen to him because he blamed the Opposition for the Government's decision not to locate AMSA in Newcastle. That is an extraordinary thing to do, because we are the Opposition. Honourable members opposite make up the Government. They make the decisions; we do not. We can make the criticisms, but they make the decisions. The honourable member on radio indicated to us that he has forgotten who is in government and who is in opposition. It is very embarrassing for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The costs of implementing AMSA and the increased costs that will flow through in certain levies and fees that AMSA will now charge will greatly erode all of the savings that have been achieved by the reforms of the Australian shipping industry. So on the one hand the Government has delivered some savings to the Australian shipping industry; on the other it has taken those away by increasing all of the charges that are provided for maritime services by the Commonwealth through this new body called AMSA. It is a typical action of this Government: the Government giveth and the Government taketh. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget we can see that the Government is not delivering in the area of micro-economic reform and is not delivering in anything like the way in which Australians expect it to do in order to improve our economy. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to mention two or three things related to the Budget, particularly transport and communications allocations. Just released is the environmental impact statement on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. It is a sad reflection on successive governments that nothing has been done to cope with the enormous challenge that is now coming to us in relation to Mascot. The simple fact is that we will not be able to cope. We are going to be very limited. We have to work out how to place limitations on access to Mascot and how we are going to cope with it. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, in particular, is very worried about Mascot. We have to look at alternatives. That is why some of the people involved in other transport industries have involved themselves in the very fast train consortium. It is going to be very sad if the very fast train consortium does not get off the ground because it would provide a very good link between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HJ4">Mr SNOW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know this is one of the few areas in which the honourable member for Throsby and I disagree, but I say to him that if we can do something about a very fast train service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, we are going to reduce considerably the pressure on Mascot. It would be very sad if that project did not go ahead. I am actually starting to come around to the views of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who has put to the Parliament and to the general public the contention that the Government ought to take a financial interest in the very fast train. It is only just recently that I have come around on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point was also put to the Government party transport and communications committee by the Australian Railways Union that the Government ought to involve itself. It may well be-this is the first time that I have said it publicly-that government financial involvement in the very fast train project would actually return a dividend in reducing the potential pressure on Mascot because it is hard to see anything happening on Mascot for at least four or five years. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wanted to mention the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report relating to roads, which was released a few months ago. Like the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), I am just amazed that the National Roads and Motorists Association (NRMA) in New South Wales, which is affiliated with the Australian Automobile Association, has not come out in strong support of the ISC. In not coming out in strong support of the ISC recommendation on mass distance charges, it is not supporting car drivers. It is no wonder that there is a very strong team led by Jane Singleton and Geoff Lawson to contest the NRMA leadership positions. </PARA>
<PARA> As an ordinary member of the NRMA I have put to the organisation that if it is to represent car drivers, the people who are actually using the roads ought to be paying for the roads. Those who are wearing out the roads ought to be paying for the cost of their upkeep. While I strongly believe that we have to take into full account the effect of mass distance charges on industries in electorates like the Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, Kennedy, and even my electorate of Eden-Monaro, we ought not get away from the proposition that the people who are using the roads heavily need to pay for them. At the same time we need to recognise areas where there are not very many alternative methods of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government in this Budget has allocated about $1.611 billion for land transport, which is a 20 per cent increase on last year, to give us an integrated land transport program. It is significant that it is the area of land transport that the Business Council of Australia says will provide two-thirds of our potential micro-economic reforms. When we are debating telecommunications, broadcasting and a whole range of contentious issues, we ought not to forget where most of the micro-economic reforms can be made: in land transport. The honourable member for Throsby and I have visited terminals around Australia-he on a former committee which he was heavily involved with as convener and I as convener of the Government's policy working group on land transport-and seen the potential for linking up shipping and ports with land transport throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly we are limited in that it will be very hard, for instance, to have two-decker carriers on trains so that we can transfer a lot of heavy freight from shipping to road. In fact, coming from Adelaide I understand that we cannot have double-decker freight trains past Parkes going towards Sydney. Plenty of reforms and attention are required, but when we think that we could save many hundreds of millions of dollars, more than it would cost to upgrade the rail link just between Albury and Junee, and get what would be 80 per cent of a potentially fast freight service overnight between Melbourne and Sydney, Sydney and Melbourne, we can see that it is well worth doing. </PARA>
<PARA> For $250m, we can save many hundreds of millions of dollars more in upgrading the Hume Highway and developing perhaps a six-lane highway which will be needed if we do not do something about rail. Similarly we ought to look at the proposition of upgrading the rail system between Melbourne and Adelaide. Between Melbourne and Adelaide we have the broad gauge system. If we changed it to a standard gauge system we would increase the traffic markedly and gain extra business. This would save many hundreds of millions of dollars more on the western highway between Melbourne and Adelaide. So plenty of work on rail can be done, which will return a dividend. Hence we have the national freight initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The moneys that have been allocated for mainland rail upgrading projects are only a start, but at least they are in the Budget. These projects will deliver a very high economic return for the community. Rail will play an increasingly important role in fulfilling the national freight task. The Government is right to pursue a national rail freight organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The States are showing a great deal of interest. We have found this from our visits around Australia. If they can translate that support into active support for a national freight corporation, nationally managed, then we will beat the challenge of high road expenditure. When we beat that challenge we will be able to competitively transfer freight on rail and we will also save a whole lot of external costs. We will reduce accidents. We will upgrade safety and save on fuel usage, with trains using up to one-fifth of the energy of aviation and roads and transferring the same quantity of passengers or goods. The work that has been done on a national freight initiative is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as that the Federal Government is assisting urban public transport to the extent of $55m. This will improve the links between suburban buses and railway stations. It will give us better trains and buses and improve other related infrastructure, infrastructure which joins up with those services. </PARA>
<PARA> There are plenty of challenges in land transport. I welcome the fact that expenditure has nearly doubled on urban public transport and has increased to $1.6 billion for an integrated land transport program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to direct my comments in the discussion of these estimates to the portfolio of aviation within the major portfolio. I found I agreed with a lot of what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), said regarding the upgrading of rail and the need for governments to plan ahead in terms of general infrastructure, including aviation. That is why I would like to say at this juncture that the Opposition welcomes the final presentation of the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. While this statement makes no particular recommendations as to how the Government should go-it will be the job of the Government to decide whether to proceed with that runway and under what terms-I express the hope that we will have some reasonable, rational and non-emotive debate and discussion about what is contained in the EIS study for Kingsford-Smith Airport (KSA).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the short term what happens at Kingsford-Smith Airport is one of the most important aspects of micro-economic reform in Australia today. If the right decision is not made in that respect then we can be in all sorts of troubles in terms of reaching our full potential in tourism and in the movement of air freight. If that decision is not made it could result in the loss of many jobs not only in New South Wales but throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We should never forget that presently Kingsford-Smith Airport employs about 22,500 people and contributes something like $3 billion to Sydney and the New South Wales revenue. There are no fewer than 400 employer organisations involved with the operation of Sydney Airport, both on and off the airport. Last year the amount of jobs in the tourist and hospitality industry that was generated by the through traffic in Kingsford-Smith was something like 23,000 for the State and 67,000 throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members look at the forward projections of the air traffic in and out of Kingsford-Smith Airport, by 2010 the capacity that will be offered by a third runway could sustain an additional 36,000 jobs in tourism in New South Wales and generate an additional $1 billion in gross domestic product (GDP). As well as that, when talking about energy saving it should also be noted that to the end of 1988 the airlines estimated that it cost them $36m in extra fuel burn because of the delays at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Kingsford-Smith and the third runway would cost something like $273m to build over a four-year period. This would go to the Federal Airports Corporation. It would not be on the Government's Budget. That in itself gives a lot of appeal to the proposal. The new runway would provide 30 per cent greater efficiency in aircraft movement. The parallel runway systems would mean less delays and certainly provide a greater safety benefit than the present cross-runway system. Most importantly, the advent of that third runway would provide the passenger capacity of something like $30m annually by the year 2010. </PARA>
<PARA> A quick glance at that particular report-we will all need a great deal of time to study more than 700 pages of the document-indicates that there will be a noise reduction in Sydney of something like 50 per cent with the introduction of the third runway. That really has a great effect on a number of people, especially in the eastern and western areas of Sydney. It means a 51 per cent reduction in the number of residents who will be seriously affected by noise and a 52 per cent reduction in the number of residents moderately affected by noise. By the year 2010 there will be virtually no noise in the suburbs east and west of Sydney airport. </PARA>
<PARA> These are very impressive figures indeed and one would hope that there will be a sane and sensible debate and discussion on the EIS and as soon as possible the Government will see fit to proceed with the construction of the third runway which Sydney and Australia so desperately need. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about airports I refer to the present construction of the new international terminal facilities at Kingsford-Smith Airport and some controversy that is presently under way regarding the awarding of tenders for the new baggage delivery system. I make an appeal to the Government, and indeed to the Federal Airports Corporation, that when they consider those particular tenders they should be looking once again to the future and to see what can be done in providing Australia not only with the most efficient baggage handling system but that they make the most appropriate decisions that they possibly can in terms of future security control. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the new additions to the international terminal at KSA that provide an opportunity for us to introduce some of the latest systems in the world. In particular, I refer to the introduction of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 10-digit licence plate baggage tag system which has been introduced into Toronto by Canadian Airlines, by United Airlines in Chicago, Eastern Airlines in Miami and British Airways in London. It is being picked up at a number of development sites around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular 10-bar code is a baggage checking system which ties in the passenger with his bag all the way down the line, whether it be on the one carrier or through interlining using a number of carriers. Most importantly it is seen as a major deterrent in terms of hijacking and any other security risks that may be involved. A passenger can be matched up to his baggage. In the Lockerbie situation this facility was not available. The development of this particular aspect of airline security was developed after the Lockerbie disaster and would appear to be able to provide a 50 per cent better chance at least of being able to stop any terrorist activities. </PARA>
<PARA> If a bag goes on a plane and the passenger does not go on the plane there is the opportunity for that bag to be retrieved very quickly. It also provides a very fast service in terms of the retrieval of baggage. At Sydney airport at this stage it gives us the first opportunity of introducing some of the state of the art equipment that is available around the world at the moment. This baggage checking system will be available as part of the development of the new Brisbane international terminal which I hope will be under way shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of other areas that I would like to refer to today. Despite the fact that the Government has made two major statements on international aviation policy, we are yet to see any real action in terms of a loosening up of the granting of international air rights. I am afraid I must say that because of the financial situation which Qantas Airways Ltd finds itself in at the moment it would appear that there are some in the Department of Transport and Communications, and indeed the airline, who are going back to the old `close up the doors, we don't want any competition, lock them out' mentality that unfortunately this country was lumbered with for so many years.</PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in this House last year made his initial statement about loosening up the system we in the Opposition welcomed it because there is a real need to overhaul and reform the method of granting aviation applications into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite as examples the situation that exists at the moment with Taiwan-I know there are some specific difficulties there-and the situation that exists with Korea. Whilst we hear all the technical arguments about the difficulties that are involved in negotiating international air rights, the plain fact is that in this country it is the national carrier, Qantas, which really determines who is or who is not going to get those rights. This is causing a great deal of concern in the tourist industry. The Industries Assistance Commission's report was quite right in really needling the cause of the problem of the development of international aviation in this country by saying that these restrictions on competition were not only overpricing air fares but also in some respects stopping the development of international tourism into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raise the issue of the airport local ownership plan. The Government has recently made some statements regarding the phasing out of that particular plan over the next four or five years. The Opposition has always supported the concept of the airport local ownership plan, but out there, especially in rural Australia, there is a great deal of concern as to exactly what the end result might be in terms of the termination of that particular plan. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue that is causing some concern in the more remote areas of Australia is the social subsidy that the Government has indicated it may provide in some circumstances. There is a feeling that a lot of those small airports, those essential airports in rural communities, are going to be left out and may be almost forced into closure by the Government. I think that we must be very wary of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also mention very briefly some allegations that were made to me and, I know, to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) because I have written to him on a number of occasions. Those allegations concern some of the activities of the investigating officers of the Civil Aviation Authority. There have been three court cases, to my knowledge, where charges have been brought against airmen. They have gone to court and they have been thrown out in recent months. If the allegations that are made against some of these airmen are matched up-and I know that they are not all angels-with the results of those court actions, one sometimes wonders whether the airmen are being a little overzealous in some of their activities. I was horrified when it was suggested in one of the cases the other day that the CAA may even challenge one of those cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to talk in this transport and communications debate. During the term of this Hawke Labor Government, rail, especially in relation to freight, will come into its own. For far too long governments of all political persuasions, both State and Federal, have let rail decline. What is particularly pleasing, especially in the speeches that have been made here this afternoon, is the generally bipartisan approach that we have to do something about rail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Particularly welcome is the Government's initiative concerning the proposed national rail freight corporation. For the first time this will give us one single authority for freight. Rail is the cheapest, most effective and efficient way to move freight, especially heavy freight, over long distances. For generations the railways have languished in a mishmash of interstate rivalry and constitutional difficulties. In no other area of government responsibility is there a greater need for modernisation and reform, and it will be this Hawke Labor Government which will bring about this modernisation and reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It almost staggers the imagination that this country does not have a national rail system. It has cost this country billions of dollars. We have to get the heavy long distance freight off the roads. The money that we are spending repairing roads could go to constructing new roads. While we leave all those heavy freight trucks on the roads, we are just churning up the roads and our money is going into repairing them. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen over the next few years is that there will be a tremendous increase in long haul freight. It is the one area in transport that is growing very rapidly. By the turn of this century Australia's domestic freight task will have grown to become 60 to 100 per cent more than what it is today. Unless we can get our railways up to scratch, the number of heavy vehicles on our roads could double from approximately 10,000 at the moment to 20,000 in the next 10 years. That is a doubling in the number of heavy freight trucks churning up our roads over the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our interstate rail system is an underutilised asset which, with the right approach, can be revitalised to take in a far greater market share of long haul freight on its true commercial merits. There is a growing acceptance of rail in the community. People come to me and talk about roads and ask why we do not put more of this heavy freight onto rail. Why does all the heavy freight from my own area of Port Kembla and Wollongong always go to Melbourne or wherever it goes by road and not rail? We have to have massive investment to bring rail up to scratch because governments have let rail decline. There has to be an investment in track, in the communications system, and the management system. We have to have more specialised rolling stock and traffic management. Management and work practices need to be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> All this brings me to very briefly comment on what my good friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) said about the very fast train. He knows as well as I do that the very fast train is not going to take freight off the road. The very fast train is going to be a passenger train. I listened to what he said about reducing the number of people using Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. For the very fast train to be profitable, it would need 6.6 million passenger movements a year. All the airlines in Australia at the moment-including the small domestic ones-only have 10 million passenger movements a year. Where are we going to get the 6.6 million passenger movements a year to go on the very fast train? It is just unrealistic. We are talking about borrowing billions of dollars from overseas which will cause a blow-out in our overseas debt, but the returns are not there for the very fast train. It is a very exciting engineering prospect, but we do not have the population in this country to provide 6.6 million passenger movements. As well it is going to do absolutely nothing to get that heavy freight that is tearing our roads to pieces off the roads. </PARA>
<PARA> It was for no small reason at all that Elders IXL Ltd recently withdrew from the project consortium. I might have my disagreements with the Chairman of Elders, but I think he showed great foresight and judgment in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the very fast train is a goer but I believe that we have to, and we will, put more money into rail. Rail has to and will play its rightful role. It will take that very heavy traffic off our roads. We can get it on to rail. Once track is put down, that is it-it is there. Rail is an asset that this country has not utilised over the last few years as it should have. That is why I particularly welcome the Government having a look at this and having meetings about the national freight initiative. This will provide an opportunity for us that may not readily occur again. I doubt whether we will ever have an opportunity again to bring this integrated freight network in. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, this may lead to the standardisation of the line between Melbourne and Adelaide, which is very important. I believe that it will improve the efficiency of rail interfaces with our ports. That is very important for this country. We have to have the whole integrated transport system in place. Of course there is a place for roads and trucks, but I very much believe that the main carrier of heavy freight over long distances must be rail. As I said before, it is the most effective and cheapest way of carrying goods. If we have money to spend, instead of talking about the very fast train-and I would be horrified if the Government put any money into that because it would be money down the drain-it should be going into our existing rail lines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For example, the huge bends in the line from Sydney to Melbourne should be straightened out. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, even when freight is being taken west of Parkes, the piggybacks cannot be brought over because of the bridges and things like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is an argument that Parkes could be established as a centre for freight. From Parkes the line could go straight down to Melbourne, up to Brisbane and across to Perth. Of course, if the line is to go to Perth, something will have to be done about the Parkes-Broken Hill link. The train could be built up in Parkes so that freight could go direct from Parkes to Perth. At the moment it is necessary to have crew changes at Broken Hill and Kalgoorlie. This adds a tremendous cost. The proposed national freight initiative will enable considerable savings in the area of rail freight. I welcome the proposals in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make one comment on the very fast train. I am yet to be convinced that the very fast train is not a con being perpetrated on the Australian people. I believe that the con is based on real estate. The consortium will never get back the $15 billion or $16 billion that will have to be borrowed overseas to establish the very fast train. It will never attain the projected 6.6 million passenger movements a year. What will happen is that real estate values will increase. In a few years the consortium will get its money back from increased land values and then step away from the project. Because there will be such a huge investment at risk, the State and Federal governments will be forced to take over the whole project and it will become a cost to the Australian taxpayer for ever more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I could just pick up the interjection, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, `Don't judge it before the feasibility study'. I think that is very wise advice to his colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I became very confused listening to the honourable member for Throsby. On the one hand he seemed to be worried about some private operators losing money and on the other he thought that somehow that was a problem for the Government. I thought the whole point about the very fast train, even though it is only at a feasibility stage, is that it is, in fact, private enterprise looking to do something to improve the transport situation in Australia. Obviously, if private enterprise is doing it, then private enterprise would have to stand the risk. I suggest that the honourable member try to remove that confusion from his thinking before he condemns an idea that after all is still only in the feasibility stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take issue with the opening remarks of the honourable member for Throsby. He talked about the great, new renaissance of trains. I am all for improving the rail system, but I wonder where he has been for the last seven years. After all, for the past seven years there has been a Labor government and it is that Labor government that has ignored the rail system. Yesterday I incorporated in Hansard-I do not know whether the Hansard is available-a table showing the level of capital funding for rail transport over the last 20 years. In fact, it was the Fraser Government that was by far the most keen and the most determined to do something about rail. The Fraser Government invested far more money into the rail system than the present Government has done. In the last two years the amount of money invested in capital works in rail by the Hawke Government was zero. I am referring to the paper that was put out by the Australian Railways Union and the Australian Conservation Foundation headed 'Mobility in a Clean Environment'. When we talk about rail, I do not think the record of the Hawke Government is all that flash. It is all very well to say that there will be some action now. As I said before, where was the honourable member during the last seven years?</PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable member for Throsby is very confused when he talks about trying to get every long distance truck off the road. I remind the honourable member that when the Inter-State Commissioner talked about the potential for the national freight initiative, he stated that the initiative would limit the rate at which truck numbers would increase above the number already on the road. It certainly will not reduce the numbers on the road now. The requirement to transport freight in Australia will increase and we will still need a vibrant trucking service. I support the honourable member's comment that Australia needs a good rail service as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time that is available to me, I would like to make a couple of points. First of all, I was amazed yet again to hear the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) quoting his usual selected statistics. While he may be able to claim that the allocation for local roads has increased in the current Budget, it has increased at the expense of other roads. In real terms, the allocation for some categories of roads has declined. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, this is very much the record of the Hawke Government. From 1983-84 through to last year, road funding in real terms declined by 30 per cent. Unfortunately, the excise that was being collected from the motorist did not decline; it was indexed. It continued to rise, so we went from the situation where in the term of office of the Fraser Government nearly 70 per cent of excise was being spent on roads to a situation now where the figure is less than 30 per cent. Under this Government there has been a very real decline in the amount of money being spent on roads. Belatedly, there has been a small increase, but, of course, it is only an increase in line with the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at Budget Statement No. 3 dealing with the Forward Estimates, we find that the allocation to road transport is expected to decline over the next three years. I ask the Minister: Does he or does he not intend to index the Australian Centennial Roads Development Fund? Is he, in fact, going to allow that real decline in road funding, as is pointed out so clearly in the Budget Papers?</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget contained reference to an allocation for rail transport of $50m, but to date no details have been announced. I think it would be reasonable to ask the Minister to advise the House what that $50m will actually be spent on. It is quite a lot of money and I think it is reasonable to ask where it is going. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of micro-economic reform-and I hope that the Government will do more than just talk about it at the next Premiers Conference-it is worth focusing on what has been happening in the States with their cost recovery on rail. Whatever way we look at it, it is disappointing at best, and in some cases a downright disgrace. Cost recovery in the area of passenger rail varies from, at worst, 16 per cent to, at best, 36 per cent. In other words, for every dollar that is being spent in running a passenger rail service, at best only 36c is being recovered and in one case it is as low as 16c. I think that result shows that when we talk about the cost to the community of rail, we also have to address the fact that there is an enormous subsidy going to passengers. I am not saying that that is not justified in many cases, but I think it is something that we should focus attention on. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to freight, again the cost recovery is very poor. I regret to say that in my own State of Victoria, in V/Line, the cost recovery on freight is less than 50 per cent; it is 46 per cent. Most States, with the exception of Queensland, also lose money on freight. I really do not think there is any excuse for that. While I welcome the tentative moves that are being made towards improving interstate rail freight with the national freight initiative, providing that leads to world best practices, it will still take four years for the national freight initiative to lead to profitable interstate rail freight. There is a big job to be done. It is one that I think the Government should be doing. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the question still remains: Why has it taken the Government seven years to realise this? This is nothing new. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn briefly to the question of matching program objectives with performance indicators. I welcome the adoption of this method by the Government. I believe that the relevance of these objectives should be defined more clearly to ascertain whether the indicators are reasonable ones to set and whether, in fact, if they are met, they amount to a reasonable achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the overall objective would be to aid the development of a land transport sector that reflects national economic and social priorities and pursues safe and efficient operations and practices responsive to user requirements. I think we would endorse that. But the question is: what performance indicators would be used to measure effectiveness and efficiency? The other point is: what benchmarks would be used to judge whether these objectives have been met? When I think of some of the roads that I have to travel on in my electorate and in other parts of Australia, if the benchmark of a dog's breakfast were offered I think that would be about as good as the achievements we have on those roads. They are an utter disgrace. If the objective is to improve the efficiency of land transport infrastructure, operation and services, does the enormous cost of road construction ever get questioned? Is the work guaranteed? These are reasonable questions. </PARA>
<PARA> If an objective is to develop practices responsive to user requirements, does anyone ever ask outback and rural road users whether they require dirt roads with potholes so big they could lose a truck down them? That is a reasonable objective, and I am sure the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, would know exactly what I am talking about. If an objective of the land transport program is to increase the safety of our transport systems, the question is: does anyone ask whether the accident rate and the incidence of serious injuries as opposed to fatalities has fallen in response to new programs? Given the improvements in paramedical technology and life sustaining technology, one would expect the rate of fatalities to fall as a matter of course, whether or not the program is meeting its objectives. Finally: does anyone ask whether there was a marked fall in fatalities and injuries in these groups specifically targeted in the road safety publicity campaigns?</PARA>
<PARA> I think all these questions are quite reasonable ones and they are ones that the Minister should be directing his attention to because, while I would welcome the ideal of having program objectives and performance indicators, we have to look closely at what we are trying to assess and whether the indicators are reasonable assessments of what we are trying to do, particularly in this area of road safety but also in other areas of road transport. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is no doubt in the minds of many Australians, particularly those living in remote areas of Australia, that road building is one of the essential services that governments must provide. But it has always been a battle for road users to convince governments, both Federal and State, of the essential requirement to provide adequate funds for road building and maintenance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Constitutional responsibility for Australian roads rests with the States, but in practice all levels of government are involved: Federal, State and local. In very general terms, responsibility is divided as follows: the Federal Government is responsible for the national highways but makes significant financial contributions to arterial roads and local roads; the States are primarily responsible for arterial roads, but they also have significant responsibility for local roads in some States; and local government, of course, is responsible for local roads and in many urban areas is also responsible for arterial roads. Under the Australian centennial roads development program, the Federal Government-this Labor Government-has widened its responsibilities so that roads that are of major commercial and economic benefit to this nation are going to receive significant upgrading, and so too it will concentrate funds for the national highways system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's standard of living and, indeed, the very survival of its industry and commerce depend on safe and secure roads. In a continent of nearly three million square miles, where tens of thousands of Australians are seriously inconvenienced by vast distances, it is incomprehensible that there should be a continuing need to sustain a campaign for increased road funding. I believe that if more people lived outside the metropolitan areas of Australia the prospect of increased funding for roads would be greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, at a time when there must be restraint and sacrifice by the nation to ensure the health of Australia's economy, this Labor Government has demonstrated that it places a high priority on improving the transport system of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This year the Federal Government will be providing in total over $1.6 billion for land transport funding, which is an increase of 13 per cent in real terms over 1989-90. Since taking office in 1983 more than $10 billion has been allocated to roads nationally and $2.1 billion has been allocated to Queensland roads alone. This year $542m has been allocated to the national highways system; nearly $429m has been allocated to the national arterial roads program; and $324m for local roads-that is, local roads administered by local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> This commitment by the Federal Government to increase road expenditure is very much appreciated by the people of north Queensland. They know that the total level of road funding provided by this Labor Government over the last seven years is 18 per cent higher in real terms than that provided by the Fraser Government over a comparable period. They know this means that this Labor Government has provided an average of nearly $200m more every year on roads than the previous Liberal-National Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give you some facts. During the last year of the Fraser Government, the Bureau of Transport Economics produced a report on road construction price indices. The report was tabled in the Federal Parliament. The report confirmed that road funding under the Fraser Government had been cut drastically in real terms. The report showed that, whilst road construction costs rose by 15.9 per cent in 1979-80 and by 15.3 per cent in 1980-81, at the same time the Fraser Government increased road funding by a niggardly 7.5 per cent in 1979-80 and a miserable 11 per cent in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> As this shabby trick was going on, the Australian public was being clobbered with heavy fuel tax, levy increases and record personal tax. It was an appalling record of neglect of adequate road funding by the previous Liberal-National Party Government. It trebled the price of petrol; it quadrupled the fuel-related tax take; and it slashed more than half a billion dollars from road expenditure. That was the record of the Opposition when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians interested in good roads should therefore ask: what would the Liberal and National parties do for road funding in the unlikely event that they were to gain government? If we are to believe their promises during the last election campaign, the Liberal and National parties would slash more than $3 billion from existing government expenditure and road funding would be one of the first casualties. Indeed, a savage cut--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, a savage cut-after that useless and stupid interjection-in road funding would be consistent with their record. The Liberal and National parties appear not to comprehend the essential and financial benefits that good roads bring for every Australian. Not only do they not understand, but they also refuse to be convinced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The economic returns from investing in good roads are substantial. The average benefit-cost ratio is of the order of 3 : 1 and, in particular-the people of North Queensland are very interested in this-for rural arterial roads it is 5 : 1. Good roads reduce vehicle operating costs, accident costs and maintenance costs. In north Queensland 80 per cent of tourists travel by road. Most of the freight, including perishables, travels by road. The economic benefits of good roads to trade and commerce are self-evident and they should be acknowledged by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The road building industry is a major employer, with more than 80,000 people employed in design, construction and maintenance of Australia's road network. Increased road funding creates more jobs. Cuts in road funding slash jobs. For example, if road funding is cut by $100m, up to 2,400 road jobs would be lost, with the prospect of further job losses in the longer term as the decrease in consumption spending in the community works its way through local economies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am therefore pleased with the importance that this Labor Government places on a safe and efficient road infrastructure for the people of Australia. Labor Government initiatives in this Budget provide for a number of new programs: for example-and I am sure that the honourable Member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) will be interested in this-a $110m road safety program over three years to eliminate traffic black spots and to encourage safety-related road management techniques, with a further $10m for road safety research and public education. This will bring the total commitment under the so-called black spots program, including for the Pacific Highway, $120m over the next three years, and $53.3m has been allocated this financial year for this essential work. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the people of north Queensland are concerned, the provincial cities and rural highways program and the urban public transport commitments by this Government spell out hope that under this Labor Government these crucial initiatives will be adequately funded so that people living in provincial and rural Australia will have access to the roads mostly enjoyed by people living in metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record tonight my gratitude for the efforts of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), for the fine work that they have done in upgrading the road system of Australia. Their record is unmatched. Given the record of the previous Liberal-National Party Government and its campaign promises, in the unlikely event of the coalition ever gaining government, the road system of Australia would creak and crack, as it did under the Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sensitivities of the Government about the rip-off that it has instituted in Australia of the Australian motorist through excise tax is evident in this place to any observer when we see the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) at successive Question Times fielding questions from his own members so that he can put a selectively quoted case before the Australian public. I wish to put the true case-and may I say, talking of the truth, that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) would not know a fact if he fell over it in broad daylight. The stuff he has just put before the Committee is utterly wrong and will not stand examination. It is no wonder that he walks out of the chamber at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real collection of funds from roads in Australia and the real expenditure is clearly set out in a background paper provided by the Parliamentary Library. It shows that the real expenditure on Australian roads under this Government has significantly declined ever since 1983-84. In fact, in talking about criticism of the Fraser regime, one finds that the in last two years of 1988-89 and 1989-90 expenditure in real terms has not reached the level of the last year of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> How dare the honourable member for Herbert come into this House and say the opposite when the figures are clearly here. The figures do not have to be tabled; they are in the Parliamentary Library and can be fully examined. It is utter nonsense and drivel to say that this Government has done better than the Fraser Government on roads. </PARA>
<PARA> What this Government has been good at is collecting taxation, and the excise has escalated to a degree where Australian motorists believe that this current Government's tax of the fuel motorists use is nothing else but carefully orchestrated government theft. That is the view of the Australian public. Why does it believe that? It believes it because of this statement in the paper to which I have referred. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Over the last few years, therefore, road funding has been receiving around 5 to 6 cents per litre from fuel excise while the total rate of excise has been in the vicinity of 20 cents per litre. Approximately one-quarter of fuel excise has thus been flowing into roads. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2H4">Mr STEELE HALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague reminds me, currently the excise does not stand at 20c but at around 24c. Quite clearly, the growth in excise from the last year of the Fraser Government of something like $1,200m to the projected yield this year of $6,100m-$6.1 billion-means that the Government is superb in one thing: it has been better than any previous government in ripping the taxation out of Australian motorists. The figures are clearly there to be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is further annoying to Australian motorists is that the graph contained in the document to which I referred is basically a straight line graph of expenditure by this Government. The dips in the graph are the decreases I referred to in the Fraser years. The Government has raised expenditure by 12 per cent this year. What does 12 per cent mean on a low base when excise has successively been increasing? So the straight line graph, in reference to expenditure from 1983-84 when this Government came to office, has been static and the collections have gone up from under $2,000m to $6,000m. No wonder we have questions to the Minister in this House trying to redirect public thought away from the absurdity of taxation on fuel today. </PARA>
<PARA> The scene is therefore set to examine, if one wants to, the Government's empty rhetoric about infrastructure, about reform of the basic support areas of Australia. It may be wharves or rail, but particularly roads. How dare this Government talk of reform and building the road structure of this country when it has so deliberately depleted government funds for the construction and repair of Australian roads! That this Government has so cruelly used the motorist and the general road user in this way by applying such high taxation is a scandal of immense proportions. </PARA>
<PARA> A current pertinent question can be put to the Government. Over the years the Government has, quite erroneously, I believe, connected its declining revenue from crude oil with its revenue from excise on fuel taken at the petrol pump; the Government has more or less considered the two together. The Government made a promise in previous years to reduce excise when its yield of tax from the basic supply of oil increased. Therefore, when the crude oil levy increased, the Government undertook to reduce the fuel excise, and in a number of years it did so. I have a table here which shows that in June, September and October 1986 until the end of 1987, when the Government's yield of crude oil levy increased, it consequently reduced the excise on petrol so that the generalised putting together of the two taxes would aggregate somewhere around the planned figure. </PARA>
<PARA> The big question to this Government now arises: what is it going to do with the windfall it is getting from the disturbance in the Middle East? Quite clearly, the Government is getting a greater yield from the crude oil levy because the price of crude oil has substantially risen. So the Government take is up. However, the Government has not readjusted the excise downward since the end of 1987. The Government gave a previous undertaking in these circumstances that it would do so. The question to the Government is: what will it do now? There are three questions that one can put: Is the Government's revenue increasing? Has it previously made an adjustment to the excise level in such circumstances? Will it reduce it now in these circumstances? That is a vital question for the Australian motorist. If the Government does not reduce the excise, it will repudiate the promise that it previously gave and the action that it previously took. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal of morality is involved in this question. I do not believe that there should be profiteering in the community from the Middle East troubles, and I do not believe that a government should be a principal in profiteering. I have not heard of any action taken by the Government so far, nor have I been given any indication of policy about this matter. A great deal of money is involved and there is unrest in the community, evidenced by the sensitivity of the Minister, who has run in here with selective quotations to use in his answers to his colleagues' set questions. The Government and the Minister owe the Australian motorists an explanation as to how they will deal with this question. By their response members of the public will know whether or not the Government intends to stand by its windfall and be a profiteer from the troubles in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> This question is separate from the excessive levels of excise that I mentioned previously. A number of factors are involved. The excise has increased at an inordinate rate. The Government has successively reduced funding for roads-quite opposite to the false information given to the House by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). The Government has successively and deliberately reduced in real terms the money going to build the structure of Australia's road transport base. At the same time it has dramatically increased excise, as deliberate Government policy. Now it is faced with the third immediate question: What will it do about its current windfall position arising from the troubles in the Middle East?</PARA>
<PARA> I would like the Minister to give this Committee the answer to that question. That answer should not be delayed. Australian motorists should not again be taken for fools. They should be answered and should know whether the Government will adjust the excise, as it has undertaken previously to do, to ensure that they are not the victims of the troubles generated in the oil producing regions of the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure honourable members will agree that one of the greatest problems in Australia at the moment is the transport and communications set-up. I doubt that the economy of Australia will properly come back or that there will be sufficient incentive unless the nation's four modes of transport and the problems that exist in them are properly understood. Principally throughout this estimates debate honourable members have been speaking about roads. It should be appreciated that roads are not the only matter involved with transport in Australia; there are also rail, air and shipping modes of transport. When one considers the circumference and geographical position of Australia, one realises that it is a large continent and many will say that great progress has been made over the 200 years since the first settlement. That is so, and at times most of us appreciate it. In the last year or so, all of a sudden, the position has been reached where something more must be done than has been done up to the present to build up the transport systems of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to speak at great length about roads, for I often do. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) spoke clearly and well in the challenge he made to the Government to explain where the extra money will be spent and what the Government intends to do with the revenue from the increase in excise. The big question being asked by those I represent, and which requires an answer, is whether the tax that they have paid for many years will go back into funding for roads. Will the general revenue collected by the Commonwealth, or the greater proportion of it, be returned to the development and maintenance of Australia's roads?</PARA>
<PARA> In the last year or so in this chamber various Ministers for land transport have emphasised that revenue from petrol tax is not meant to be returned directly for expenditure on roads. The Government of which I was a member could not-and I do not believe that any government could-convince the Australian motorists that a fair proportion of the tax they pay on every litre of fuel must be returned to roads. That is my personal attitude, and the attitude of the Opposition parties to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Whoever occupies the Government benches in this House must decide on a better way, by micro-economics or macro-economics-whatever the term might be-to improve Australia's transport systems. More money must be directed towards roads. That would be for the benefit of the consumers, safety of road transport, maintenance of vehicles and anything else that affects motorists. Over the years the Commonwealth has played a greater role generally in directing where the States and local government should spend their money. This Government must make up its mind whether it is proper under our Constitution for there to be greater control by the Commonwealth over State and local government as to the expenditure of funds. I suggest that it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Australian taxation system the Commonwealth has a responsibility to collect fuel tax. The States have a right to impose a tax of their own on fuel, as New South Wales has done. That State is beginning to see the benefit of the expenditure of money raised by the State fuel tax on the State's road system. If the money spent on every kilometre of road in this country is to be effective, a decision must be made as to where the responsibility for that expenditure lies. My view is that primarily it lies with State governments and local governments to determine the priority for expenditure of those funds. </PARA>
<PARA> I give some credit to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for his attention to the arterial national roads, because more is being spent on the Pacific Highway. I welcome those funds, no matter where they come from. In the long term, are they coming from the proper source? Is the administration of those funds and the allocation of priorities being determined correctly? I doubt whether they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I should speak briefly about airports and air transport, but first I shall speak about shipping, which is a national tragedy for Australia. The Australian National Line should be sold. It has become a burden for Australia. The Government should get rid of that line, let it go, and increase the efficiency of the ports and the turnaround time so that ships can unload and reload efficiently and more quickly. When something does not pay and private enterprise can take it over, the time has come to get rid of it. </PARA>
<PARA> When the railroads, shipping lines and the national airlines were established, there was an argument for having those facilities provided by the Government, because government was the only organisation that could do it. This country has grown up. Private enterprise is ready to invest in these facilities. Recently the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), speaking on a matter of public importance, illustrated the cost of shipping using Australia's shipping lines compared with overseas lines. The evidence is there. </PARA>
<PARA> I should speak briefly about airlines. Today a report has been released of an environmental feasibility study on Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I have a brief note of some of the recommendations made in that report, which has been released some seven months late. It is a scandal that the Government abandoned building a third runway back in 1983. The Government will have to live with that decision for the rest of its days. That was a tragedy for tourism, country commuters and interstate transport. Some of the figures contained in the report make one begin to realise that the Sydney airport contributes $3 billion a year to the revenue of New South Wales. In 1988-89 tourism was Australia's greatest export earner, with foreign exchange earnings of $5.4 billion. The tourist industry is reliant upon the airports of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> International tourists who came through the Sydney Airport generated approximately 23,000 in that State and another 67,000 jobs throughout Australia. Over half of the incoming traffic into Australia each year comes through the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I understand that experts have said that Badgerys Creek will not pay until we have a population of 30 million people or more. If Badgerys Creek will not pay until, it is estimated, the year 2010, that is another reason why this Government has to proceed with an extra runway at Sydney Airport. I appeal to the Government to proceed immediately. The three-month period in which the public could make comment is over. </PARA>
<PARA> It should forget about the political consequences that worry a certain number of honourable members who represent electorates near the airport. I am sure that the majority of Government members, particularly those in the Ministry, agree that that runway should proceed. It is a necessity and it has to proceed. The situation at Sydney Airport affects the commuters in the country. This is why we now have an extra charge at the busy time of day. Commuter planes from my electorate of Lyne that fly into Sydney will have to pay an extra charge from now on. Next thing the planes will be diverted to Bankstown or Camden or somewhere else. The people will not accept this situation and they will turn around and drive their cars into the metropolitan area, cluttering up the highway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in briefly summing up this debate. Firstly, I thank honourable members from both sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. They were, if nothing else, at least passionate. Whether or not that passion was based on fact or fiction is, of course, open to judgment. I must say that some honourable members in their contributions left a lot to the imagination because they did not seem to have a lot of facts in front of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I must say that the contributions of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), from the Government side of the House, certainly showed an understanding of the Government's concerns in the area of transport and communications and the need for reform in the country. Indeed, this also seems to have been acknowledged, albeit not openly in some cases, but at least tacitly, by our friends in the Opposition. Although the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) seemed to be talking about road reform, they did not talk about the Inter-State Commission. I wonder whether that is because they do not want to recognise the work that is being done by the Government in the area of micro-economic reform on roads. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fine for members of the Opposition to come into this House and bemoan the rate of micro-economic reform that is being undertaken by this Government, but the facts remain that in the context of the transport and communications portfolio the level of micro-economic reform which is being introduced by this Government is far and away in advance of anything which was undertaken by the Fraser Government or any other conservative government in this country's history. </PARA>
<PARA> In my remarks tonight I wish to concentrate on a number of matters raised in the contribution of the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). I found the honourable member's contributions slightly fascinating because he began by bemoaning the fact that the Government was working in cooperation with the stevedoring industry and the waterside unions in terms of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority and suggested, by innuendo if not by declaration, that the rate of reform which is being undertaken as a result of WIRA was inappropriate. At the same time, he seemed to be suggesting that it was inappropriate for government to work in a coordinated and consultative fashion with the trade union movement and the stevedoring companies. The honourable member then turned around and said that he thought that the Shipping Industry Reform Authority-the equivalent in terms of shipping-worked well. He gave it a great deal of praise in the context of the work which is being done by the Seamen's Union, in particular by Pat Geraghty. I suggest to the honourable member for Gilmore that he take a positive approach to the consultative mechanisms which this Government has put in place in the context of the waterfront reform process and that he understand that, whilst the process might be difficult, advances are being made and they are being made without unnecessary confrontation or division on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Gilmore ought to know, the Government has given considerable attention to finding workable solutions to the problems on the waterfront. The Inter-State Commission provided a comprehensive analysis of waterfront operations in its recommendations. The central thrust of the Commission's recommendations is the major reform of waterfront labour arrangements. This has led, as the honourable member for Gilmore ought to know, to the signing of an in-principle agreement between key unions and employers which was negotiated under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. The implementation of the in-principle agreement is expected to lead to the completion of enterprise-based agreements by the end of this year. I would have thought that the honourable member for Gilmore would have supported that initiative. No one denies that it has not been a somewhat difficult task but, at the same time, if one does not sit down and work out reasonable solutions in a negotiated fashion through consultation and discussion, it is unlikely that one will achieve acceptable reforms. The new arrangements which will be brought about on the waterfront will increase competitive pressures and these will be reinforced by the Trade Practices Commission which will ensure that stevedores operate in accordance with the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to comment on the contribution by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown). He cited an example of a person in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and referred to the rural and remote area program (RRAP). I could not understand from what the honourable member was saying whether he thought the RRAP program was a good idea or not. I am in the fortunate position of being able to remember vividly what it was like to live in a very remote part of Australia without any formal types of communication. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may, I will take the time to indicate to the honourable member for Menzies that there are many thousands of Australians who would not have any form of telecommunications if it were not for the RRAP program which, I might add, is funded by Telecom Australia to the tune of some $550m. This program has been set up as an initiative of this Government and it ought to be plain to the honourable member for Menzies that in view of the sorts of reforms which this Government is putting into place, compared with the sorts of policies which are being proposed by his Party-indeed, by himself in the context of communications-it is very unlikely that we would ever see a RRAP program introduced by a conservative government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981 I had the good fortune to be living in the north-west of South Australia in a little Aboriginal community with a population of about 150 to 200. The only communication we had with the outside world at that stage was by way of the Flying Doctor radio. Once a week-if we were lucky-the mail plane came through and, occasionally, in terms of land transport, road trains came in from the railhead at Marla. Since the introduction of the RRAP program, these people have gained access to telecommunications. They now have telephones and they can now communicate, as we can communicate, by picking up the telephone and ringing Alice Springs, Kalgoorlie, Adelaide or wherever they have to do business. That service did not exist before and it is something which would not have existed had the conservative parties been in government in this country. Certainly, in view of the sorts of scenarios which the Opposition is foreshadowing in its proposed telecommunications policy, it is clear that these sorts of programs would not be introduced if the Opposition were in government now. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there was a Federal Court judgment related to one aspect of telecommunications and Telecom's activities. That judgment indicated that Telecom's charges were fair and reasonable in the context of that remote areas program. I say to the honourable member for Menzies that he should get his mind around the RRAP program, understand the sort of cross-subsidisation which already takes place within telecommunications and ask himself, as other members of his Party should ask themselves, whether those sorts of programs would ever be introduced if the telecommunications policy of the Opposition were ever put in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is using the Lord Nelson technique. He does not want to reply; he does not want to see that which he does not want to see. He has got his telescope to his blind eye. He has not explained to us as a Committee how he and his Government are champions of micro-economic reform when in the last two financial years the actual amount in real terms of funds devoted to the road program in Australia by the Commonwealth Government has not yet returned in the level of expenditure on that item in the last year of the Fraser Government. He has given no explanation for that. How can the Parliamentary Secretary sustain the claim that his Government is about the issue of micro-economic reform? Such an argument does not even get off the ground. It is not in tatters; there is no argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My main question to the Parliamentary Secretary, which he has totally ignored, is this: What is his Government going to do about the windfall revenue the Government is getting daily from the increased price of crude oil? Prior to 1988 the Government reduced the excise on fuel at the pump when there was a rise in the yield of the crude oil levy. This is not the subject of some little commercial blip on the market; there is an enormously disruptive rise in crude oil prices because of the aggression in the Middle East. I ask the Minister: Is the Government going to stand by and become a profiteer out of the troubles in that part of the world and all of the troubles it has created for the broad spectrum of fuel users?</PARA>
<PARA> The questions require an answer because this Government had a policy on this matter prior to 1988, at a time when oil prices were at world parity. There may have been a total deregulation of the industry since 1988 but the same principle is there quite clearly before him. It is not good enough to fob off the motorist and ignore the question. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary again: What is his Government going to do? Is it again going to reduce the rate of excise so that there will be no additional rip-off of the Australian motorist?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to address my remarks to that part of the Budget appropriations dealing with education. The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 appropriates money to fund the system of bureaucratic control which the Labor Government has imposed on education in this country. It also provides the main appropriation for student assistance. There are three principles which have a rhetorical place, but no place in substance, in the Government's game plan for Australian education. Those principles are quality, flexibility and diversity. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) is obsessed with numbers and control-preferably central control from Canberra. It is no secret that the Minister and the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) are the best of friends. The Minister has from time to time dabbled in a bit of number counting for the Treasurer, though after some less than spectacular results the Treasurer has not of late sought the Minister's services in that area. It is apparent that the Treasurer's failures are well complemented by his good friend's education budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After seven years of mismanagement under the accord, the Budget has been rightly lambasted in all sections of the community as a budget lacking vision, substance and solutions. Teaching and research in this country are suffering from high interest rates, high taxes and the centralised industrial relations system, just as the families and businesses of this land are also suffering. There are few areas more devoid of hope than the education part of this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Education is suffering serious damage at the present time-not merely because of the failure of the Government's economic policies and the accord but because of the ill-considered and ill-justified upheaval which the Minister has brought about in higher education and because of the unrelenting drive for central control which characterises the Government's approach. This Bill funds a system of control over higher education which is inappropriate to encourage the growth of excellence in teaching and research which Australia requires and which will never satisfactorily provide the opportunities for staff and students which should be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements funded through this legislation reflect the imposition on higher education in Australia, and increasingly on schools and technical and further education, of the corporate state framework which typifies Labor's style of government. Higher education institutions must now negotiate individually with the Commonwealth on the basis of educational profiles. Instead of moving towards a healthy level of competition amongst institutions of higher education, institutions are engaged in a thoroughly unhealthy competition for bureaucratic favours and political approval. In relation to higher education, for example, the Minister has armed himself with two very powerful weapons: a virtually unlimited power to impose conditions on grants and a power to intervene in industrial relations. At the same time the Minister has been freed from virtually any obligation to report the reasons for his decisions to the Parliament or the public. These powers have been exercised to force amalgamations on frequently unwilling institutions and this process is continuing. Some have resisted or are currently resisting successfully. Others are still being bludgeoned into submission by financial threats. This is happening because under the reigning ideology big is better and bureaucratic supervision is easier over the few than over the many. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that big is better-educationally or financially. On the contrary, as Professor John Passmore told the Senate inquiry into priorities in higher education:</PARA>
<PARA> American parents who can afford to do so very frequently send their children to what are by Australian standards very small colleges with somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 students. The undergraduate teaching in the large universities is often quite dreadful. The decline in German universities with their growth in size no one would deny. Research comes out of the small Max Planck institutions. The large French and Italian universities are now notoriously bad. The Sorbonne had to be broken up into 10 smaller institutions. Even so, the crucial elements in France are the small Hautes Ecoles and the College de France. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a great danger that the amalgamations will lead to a loss of diversity in course offerings as former college courses are transformed towards the university model, and I would not be too heartened by evidence that associate diplomas have been picked up by some institutions. The amalgamations also pose the threat that already scarce research funds will be spread even more thinly as internal politics operate across the now large institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest danger, however, in the administrative arrangements which are being funded through this Bill is the threat they contain of direct political interference-for political reasons-in what should be educational decisions, and the diversion of funds appropriated for education to suit the political requirements of the Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that there are currently institutions in this country which fear they will be punished by the Minister for failing to go along with his plans for them. The question of institutional independence and academic freedom remains very much on the agenda of higher education in this country, and it is the Minister who put it there. </PARA>
<PARA> While the decisions being funded through this legislation have raised these issues, matters crucial to the quality and opportunity in higher education remain unaddressed. Some 13,000 to 20,000 qualified students cannot find places. The Vice-Chancellors Committee projects a shortage of academic staff by the year 2000 of up to 20,000. The numbers of research post-graduate students going through the system who must provide the future staff is calculated to be only 38 per cent of the number needed for expansion and replacement. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless higher education in the country provides a better institutional environment for staff, unless staff have confidence in their academic independence, unless the serious current morale problems are solved, and unless Australian higher education increases the competitiveness of its conditions internationally, it will not be able to satisfactorily address the looming problems in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> No area of education more clearly illustrates the bull at a gate approach to education policy than the handling of the export of education. To the apparent frustration of many of his ministerial colleagues, we have had an impulsive set of policies made in this area. Basics in policy making, such as careful consideration of risks and costs in undertaking a policy initiative, were clearly inconveniences to be best ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Public Service, the media and even his own colleagues told the Minister up to three years ago that there were risks for immigration policy in developing an education export industry, the Minister was unmoved. Budget Paper No. 1 lists the four main factors accounting for the growth in education outlays for the next financial year. The third item, amounting to some $50m, is for loans and refunds to overseas students affected by the Government's belated moves to tighten up visa entry requirements for such students. The Budget process provided the Minister with an opportunity to address a festering problem within the education portfolio, that of student income support. It is a matter of regret that the Minister did not take up this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> There would hardly be an honourable member who has not received a representation, if not numerous representations, on schemes such as Austudy. There is a widespread perception in the community that the scheme does not operate fairly. We all know that there are those in receipt of benefits who should not be receiving them and there are those who are genuinely needy yet who are missing out. </PARA>
<PARA> Virtually any child from a farming background is now excluded from Austudy as a result of the application of the assets test. Austudy is a scheme which is supposed to facilitate access. It is a scheme which is supposed to assist those who would otherwise not undertake further study, but 42 per cent of all tertiary students receive it. It is a poorly targeted scheme. It discourages students from part time work and it encourages the fraudulent underdeclaration of income. It is a ramshackle scheme in need of thorough review. I tell the Minister quite frankly that far more is needed to address the problems in this area and he should have taken the opportunity to address them. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental fact is that the prescriptions for education reform in this country-more central control, more uniformity and less diversity-do not work. They erode quality and undermine opportunities for students. It is a matter of deep concern to the coalition that education is being damaged as a result of the inability of the Government to grasp this essential fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the promises we made at the last election was to create the clever country. One major component of this strategy is to be found in the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) budgetary allocation and the role it plays in improving the skill and education level of the Australian population is an important function. I want to talk chiefly about the tertiary education sector but we have to put it against a broader strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Expenditure on education has risen in real terms during the period of this Government by about 2 per cent per annum. This, together with other factors, including greater community and parental awareness of the value of an investment in further education-even in simple commercial terms a degree may be worth anything up to $400,000 of lifetime earnings-has produced a rising school retention rate to year 12 from about 35 per cent to over 60 per cent in eight years. Many of the young Australians involved in this expansion want higher education places, mostly in universities. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Government has produced the most rapid growth in university places for nearly two decades. Some of its means, however, have not been fully welcomed by university academic staff. As a former academic and President of my Federation of Australian University Staff Associations branch I am only too well aware of this. Some of the opposition was just fear of the unknown, some of it was based on real fears for academic standards and funding levels. I believe this DEET budget, and attendant documents, have turned the corner on this matter and will reassure most of my former colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to provide more tertiary places, the Government could have either expanded the existing universities or utilised the staff and facilities of the other existing higher education institutions and transformed them into universities. It chose the latter course. As this process occurred, it used the opportunity to encourage the rationalisation of the institutional structure of tertiary education. The result, so far, has been the reduction in the number of institutions from over 60 to nearly 40, and still going down, with the aim that all will become universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems of relative esteem that spring from this process will no doubt take some time to resolve. But financial problems of distribution have already occurred. Generally, the pre-1987 universities were better funded in terms of capital, equipment and library stock than the old college sector. It is also generally the case that the universities catered for the better-off sectors of the community, the colleges for the intermediate sector, and the leave-school-before-Year 12 for the working class and the disadvantaged. The new system required a levelling process as part of its transformation. </PARA>
<PARA> It was never intended that the old universities and the prominent schools which furnished such a high percentage of their student intake should be downgraded. It was intended that the new intake of additional students should come from a wider socio-economic background. </PARA>
<PARA> During this readjustment, it became clear that the `Ivy League' of old universities could quickly remedy any relatively advantaged position in their funding structure by merging with colleges. Many have done this already as the binary system was abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> In my own State, it has been finally agreed in the last month to establish a three institution model out of a sector which was extremely diverse and scattered until perhaps a decade ago. Most of the South Australian College of Advanced Education will go with the South Australian Institute of Technology to form the new University of South Australia; Flinders University will merge with the Sturt campus of the College of Advanced Education; and the University of Adelaide will merge with Roseworthy College and the former city campus of the CAE. This process, it should be noted, was undertaken voluntarily. Indeed, an earlier model that was encouraged on the institutions-and I was a part of the negotiating process that sought to encourage this-was rejected. It was rejected by these institutions despite the fact that it was advocated and encouraged by the Federal and State governments. These are voluntary amalgamations. The question now arises: how should this newly reorganised sector be funded?</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget Papers show a real expenditure increase of around 7 per cent in 1990-91, reflecting increases in the number of places by around 15,500 annually; in capital funding of $89m; in an additional $30m to under-funded universities; and in Austudy payments of $56m. This is, in turn, one step in the overall program of increasing the number of Australians with access to universities by 70,000, or about 23 per cent, between 1988 and 1993. Some of the increase will come from an increase in higher education contribution scheme (HECS) revenue, but most is still from the general taxpayer. Some again will derive from the commercial arms that all universities have more recently established, but my experience as a long-serving board member on one of these related companies leads me to believe it may be some time before this revenue source comes on stream in a substantial way. </PARA>
<PARA> How then does this money get allocated? Due to historical processes, the staff and students of the new sector are now unevenly funded. The old universities were thought to receive most and from there most of the opposition to change was to be determined. The old college and new university sector was generally believed to receive least and from there the support for change was generally greater. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then took three major steps. It clawed back about one per cent of the old university funding, gave it to the Australian Research Council, and made it open to competitive applications. It allocated funds to assist institutional amalgamations through an adjustment package which may comprise grant and/or load adjustments and will be implemented over the 1990-91 triennium and beyond, where necessary. It set about creating a rational funding model for both teaching, which comprises about 94 per cent, and the research infrastructure, which is about 6 per cent, of total funding. The latter will report next year. In other words, the disparities in existing capital stock-the buildings, sites, libraries, endowments-are not yet addressed. Whether they will be and in which fashion is yet to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The new teaching funding model, however, has now been distributed in the paper Assessment of the Relative Funding Position of Australia's Higher Education Institutions which was distributed last month. It divides teaching disciplines into five clusters in accord with the cost of supporting a student in each, the range going from the humanities, which are relatively cheap, to medicine, which is expensive. It then establishes a profile for each university according to its teaching program. Finally, it establishes whether these institutions are `under-funded' or `over-funded'. The result is then presented in three tables for 1988, 1989 and 1990. The new model is designed to be used at the system-wide level only. Institutions will be free to determine the internal allocation of the resources for themselves independently of government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of interesting factors emerge from this report. First, there were wide disparities in 1988 with the Australian National University doing by far the best, the ivy league universities somewhere in the middle to the upper end of the middle, and the University College of Southern Queensland the worst. Secondly, by 1990-within three years-there had been a considerable levelling for most of the institutions towards the mean as a result of amalgamations and changes in their student numbers. Thirdly, it was clear that the Government would need to continue to develop and apply its new funding model if it were to produce a more equitable outcome in the teaching resources available to all university students, that is, to all Australians going through the tertiary education system for which they will pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In the other area the institutions vary widely in their winning competitive research grants which are now generally augmented by clawback funds and special research centres to reach nearly $1 billion for the next five years. This disparity in winning these funds may continue for some time since this is a competitive pursuit of excellence. In other words, this Budget continues to reflect the reform program which will produce a university sector which is bigger, more accessible, more equitably and rationally funded and has greater research funding allocated on a competitive basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I have two universities in my electorate, or at least I will have as of January next year-the old University of Adelaide and the new University of South Australia. Both will benefit from the reform program I have described. After 15 years of near stagnation, Adelaide will grow by 30 per cent in student numbers in five years to 1992. This will include many special entry students, reflecting its egalitarian commitments. It remains the nation's premier university in terms of research grants won proportionately. It would like a few more dollars to assist its amalgamations, but it is doing nicely. </PARA>
<PARA> The new University of South Australia is slightly under-funded and will attract a few more dollars for this and its extensive amalgamation programs. It is slightly more accessible, rather more innovative, and more of my voters are likely to go there. It is looking for an extension of its research function in coming years. </PARA>
<PARA> After the steady growth of a decade and the apprehensions of the last two years, this Budget ensures that most universities can look forward to their growth on an assured financial basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has announced an increase in Austudy payments of $56m in the 1990 Budget. Outlays in student assistance now total over $1.2 billion, which constitutes around 16.2 per cent of total education outlays. This increase was offset by a $13m saving projected for this year by a tightening of the assets test for Austudy payments. I believe that this decision blatantly discriminates against students from rural areas whose parents may have property and machinery, but no means of supporting the continued costs of study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's treatment of Austudy in this Budget is simply another chapter in Austudy's sorry history of inadequacy since it took over from the tertiary education assistance scheme (TEAS) in 1984. Austudy has failed to deliver in terms of its objectives; it has been riddled with fraud and overpayments; and its administration by the Department of Employment, Education and Training has been simply woeful. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy has failed demonstrably in one of its stated objectives of bringing about a change in the patterns of participation in higher education of the major social groups in Australian society. Few children from poor families complete year 12. Most technical and further education (TAFE) students come from working-class families while the more prestigious universities and colleges are attended by those from upper socio-economic groups. </PARA>
<PARA> A report by Price Waterhouse in September 1987, following an investigation into the nature and extent of payment fraud in the area of student assistance, made 31 recommendations for the improvement of Austudy. Almost two years later-in December 1989-the Auditor-General's report into Austudy made a staggering 124 recommendations. The Price Waterhouse report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Successful fraud arises from a combination of two factors- applicant dishonesty and-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the next factor-</PARA>
<PARA>a loose administrative control environment. </PARA>
<PARA>A survey conducted in 1988 by the staff of the Austudy benefits control unit found that 27 per cent of Austudy recipients were overpaid. If the sample data were applied to the total population, close to $40m occurred in overpayments in Austudy in 1988. That constitutes an amazing 10 per cent of the total Austudy expenditure for that year. I believe, as do many other members on this side of the House, that the whole system of student assistance, as it is encapsulated or addressed in Austudy, is in dire need of critical analysis and serious overview. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, having had the benefit of these two previous studies-the Price Waterhouse report and the Auditor-General's report-now has an inquiry into student assistance being conducted by the House of Representatives Joint Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am a member. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Friday prior to the Budget, I was interested to read an article in the Australian Financial Review which pointed out that the Federal Government was going to extend the payment of its tertiary students assistance scheme, Austudy, to private tertiary institutions. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The move has brought howls of protest from academic and student groups who accuse the Government of overturning a longstanding Labor principle of not supporting private institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Not surprisingly, when we had the Budget this decision went only part way towards addressing an important principle where there is a real inequity. In this instance the Government clearly bowed to factional ideological pressure yet again. It really does makes one wonder who is running this country. Every decision that the Government makes, from the big ones, such as privatisation, which has been canvassed so widely here even today, down to the relatively small ones, apparently must be sanctioned by the Left, by the unions and by the dozens of small interest groups that the Government must appease. These groups quite clearly govern the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's first private university, Bond University, is situated in the heart of my electorate. It has achieved tremendous things in its first 16 months or so and has established itself as a role model for other private tertiary institutions. Bond currently has 940 enrolments. It has a faster growth rate than most public universities. It has almost as fast a growth rate as Monash University had and that is generally acknowledged to have had one of the fastest growth rates of all the universities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The building program that has made Bond a most attractive campus is almost completed. We expect the last building to be completed in 1992. Around Australia other institutions have followed Bond's lead. We have Notre Dame Catholic University in Fremantle and another private tertiary institution, Hastings, due to open at Port Macquarie. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the Labor Party and its antiquated ideology, private universities are here to stay. Bond University has been lobbying the Federal Minister for some time in respect of the extension of Austudy benefits to students who attend Bond and who will attend other private tertiary institutions. Students at Bond do not ask for an increase in the income test threshold and they do not ask for special or privileged consideration. They ask for the same rights as every other Australian who pursues tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA> The case for the extension of Austudy benefits to private students has two main arguments. The first is made on the grounds of equity and the right of all Australians to choose their place of higher education. The second is made on the ground that student benefits which extend access to and stabilise private institutions will increase opportunities for entry to higher education. Is that not what the Government wants?</PARA>
<PARA> Bond University is a State university under private sponsorship. It is answerable through its establishment Act to the Parliament of Queensland in the same way as are publicly funded universities. The academic degrees which Bond offers must meet the same public and professional scrutiny as the State universities. Its graduates must ultimately compete in a shrinking job marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to note-I am sure other members would have been-an item in yesterday's Australian Financial Review reporting that Bond's first business management graduates had been offered very good jobs in the private sector work force. The fact is that private institutions-not only Bond but the others that are coming on-stream-do have a vital role to play in the future of education in Australia. The Labor Party appears to have a terrific problem with that. It refuses to acknowledge that the private sector could do as good a job, if not a better one, than the public sector in tertiary education. It is the same old paranoia and fear of competition that the Labor Party is doing backflips with at the moment. The Government pays a great deal of lip service to the notion of competition and it is very big on rhetoric on this subject but it remains philosophically paralysed in respect of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that a private institution such as Bond will not survive unless it meets the long and short term needs of the student. It will not survive unless its service is respected. Thus, it provides standards which the public provider must recognise and creates those competitive tensions vital in making institutions accountable in ways that an effective democratic system demands. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy does not in any way constitute government support for any individual institution. It is the embodiment of an intrinsic belief in Australian society that if a place can be earned in a properly constituted higher education institution then it is a right for these students to obtain means tested access to a living allowance. Why then are students in private institutions who are not wealthy-and I am talking particularly about Bond University at the moment-but earn a place or are prepared, as some of them are, to borrow the funds necessary to pay their own way, being discriminated against and continuing to be discriminated against by this Government? The answer is this--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not go that far. The element of the Budget of the Department of Employment, Education and Training to which I would like to pay particular attention is the section relating to teacher salaries. Within this Budget increases have been allowed for teacher salary rises as a result of award restructuring. The particular section of the Budget estimates which deals with this allows for an increase of $25m in the 1990-91 Budget for teacher salaries and a $50m allocation for each of the forward years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very important element of this Budget because the award restructuring process that has been going on for the last two years in the education sector goes to the very heart of the survival of our education in Australia. Award restructuring and increases in teacher salaries are essential to the achievement of the fundamental aims that the Government has for award restructuring and labour market reform. </PARA>
<PARA> In the education sector we were facing a real crisis with regard to the salary levels that were being paid to teachers. The situation had arrived where we were unable to attract students into teacher training institutions, nor were we able to maintain our teachers within our education institutions because of the very low levels of salary that were being paid to teachers as compared with other professions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The process of award restructuring that has been going on for the last two years has been a crucial part in trying to ensure that the education sector is able to cope with the modern demands of the technological age and that we have an education sector that has highly qualified and highly motivated teachers able to deliver quality education to the students of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing about the award restructuring process is the massive contrast it provides between the industrial relations policies of the conservative opponents and those of the Labor Government. What has been occurring in the last two years in the award restructuring process in the education sector has been a meaningful series of negotiations designed to try to achieve a flexible and more modern award to suit the 1990s for the education sector. The main players in this process-the Government, the private sector employers, the teachers and teacher unions and the parents-have all gone through a very long and painful process to try to arrive at a new series of awards to cover the education industry. That process is not yet completed. There is a lot of work still to be done. There are several decisions still to be brought down. It is important that within this Budget, within the Department of Employment, Education and Training estimates, there has been funding provided to allow for those teachers' salary rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The very important features of the award restructuring process that I would like to talk about this evening concern improving the education sector and ensuring that it is able to cope with the demands of our modern society. One of the first points that I would like to raise is one of the very grave problems that we faced-that is, a career path for teachers. The new awards that are being drawn up in each State and the Territories achieves a far better career path for teachers. It also incorporates within that process an encouragement for teachers to upgrade their qualifications and to continue to improve their teaching skills throughout their teaching careers, as well as recognition of the broad range of other extracurricular activities that teachers undertake and for which they presently receive no payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The new career path for teachers is a very important element of award restructure. Under the existing or previous awards that were applying to teachers, once a teacher had taught for seven or eight years-and usually they started at age 20-and reached the age of 27 or 28 he had reached the top of the pile as a classroom teacher. There was no further room for him to go unless he was prepared to go on the promotional path which often meant that he had to leave the classroom to be able to achieve those higher salaries. That led to a situation where our best and most highly qualified teachers were the ones who were no longer going to be in the classroom because they were highly motivated and highly qualified and were determined to try to improve themselves. The only way that they could do so within the existing salary structure was to leave the classroom and go into administrative positions. </PARA>
<PARA> The important feature that is occurring in award restructuring for teachers is that we have now established a career path for classroom teachers which will pay them a salary commensurate with their abilities, their experience and their qualifications and will also encourage them to stay in the classroom so that the fundamental work of teaching-that is, working with students in classes-is continued to be provided by the best teachers. That is a very crucial issue in the award restructuring process. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this the award restructuring process has established some new promotional positions which still allow the person to remain in the classroom. The title of that new category of promotional position is advanced skills teacher. What that does is pay teachers for advanced skills that they have acquired through their years of experience or through their qualifications gained through tertiary institutions and encourages them to implement those new skills in their teaching and not in an administrative sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The third important feature of award restructuring that has occurred in the negotiations for new awards around Australia has been the greater flexibility in hours and modes of operation of certain educational facilities, particularly in the secondary area, which allow more efficient and effective use of these facilities to cater for the broad range of needs of young people, for a variety of education courses and types of courses and also the timing of those courses. That is also a very important feature of award restructuring because we have billions of dollars tied up in this country in educational institutions. The aim of educational authorities and unions has been to achieve a more flexible approach to their usage so that they can be used more fully to cater for the needs of students through a broader range of hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth achievement of the award restructuring is the encouragement of school graduates to enter teacher training courses by paying them a reasonable wage. Teacher training was not able to compete with other professions because of the fact that the starting salaries for beginner teachers were so low. The people who were the high quality graduates from secondary schools would not go into teaching because salaries were so low. They were more prepared to go into industry, computing or science. Now with the new salary rates we hope that the high quality students will be able to come back into the education sector. That is not to say that there are not very high quality students going into education, but we certainly have been having difficulties attracting teacher graduates, particularly into the science and maths areas, because of the low salaries that teachers are paid. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three important features of the award restructuring process that we should realise. The first is the important role of a quality education system in the restructure of the Australian economy and the development of the Australian work force. That is crucial to all the Government's aims with its micro-economic reform program. The second important basis of award restructuring has been the need to recruit high quality entrants, as I mentioned before, and the third point is the recognition of the increased complexity of teachers' work in the last 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the whole process undergone by all the main players in the education sector in arriving at this new package of award restructuring has highlighted the great difference in approach that this Government has to industrial relations compared with our opponents opposite. In sharp contrast to the dog eat dog confrontationist style of the conservative forces, this Government has embarked on one of the most fundamental reforms of the labour market by processes of negotiation, consultation and constructive discussion of mutual needs and responsibilities with all the players involved in the education sector or whatever sector we might be talking about when we are talking about award restructuring. This process means that all the parties negotiate a new package of salaries and conditions of employment under the general supervision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and within the basic principles which protect and enhance the national interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just before I was interrupted I was posing the very important question of why students at Bond University are discriminated against in respect of Austudy. I now want to take the opportunity of answering that question. The answer is very simple. It is because the Labor Party, and especially the Minister concerned, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), cannot get over an ideological hurdle in order to run the race of the twenty-first century. This is despite the benefits that would result for the public sector and the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For every student who opts to pay his way in the form of private institution fees, there is one more place free in a public university. It goes even beyond Austudy when it comes to students at Bond. Honourable members should bear in mind that I am talking about Bond here, but we will soon have, as I said before, other tertiary institutions that are privately owned. I mention Notre Dame Catholic University in Fremantle and Hastings at Port Macquarie. The Minister will have to come to grips with this situation before long. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking not only about an ideological bias against students at Bond University in respect of Austudy, but also about the ineligibility of students at Bond for Commonwealth postgraduate research awards. The Government once again is being inconsistent and discriminatory. The Government talks about Australia becoming-and we have heard it almost ad nauseam-a clever country, and yet again for blatant, ideologically biased reasons it denies Bond students, who might be the best qualified academically, access to Commonwealth postgraduate research awards. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of increasing Austudy payments and continuing to bolster an ineffective system, as the Government did in this Budget, it should be looking closely at Austudy and examining ways that it can be improved and ways that quality and efficiency of public education can be raised. By making private education more attractive, we will improve the role it has and will have to play in the future in Australia's education system. We will introduce a competitiveness that will conceivably increase academic standards. We will confirm that support mechanisms are a right of all Australian university students and not a privilege of those who choose the public alternative. We will perhaps lower the demand for the creation of more places at public institutions each year which currently costs the Government $130m. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a great shame, though as I said before not entirely surprising, that the Government did not extend Austudy payments to students at Bond University in the 1990 Budget. It is not surprising because it did require and does require a shift in its traditional ideology. It requires a decision. It is not a big decision. It should not even be a particularly difficult decision, but we know because we see it here every day that the Government is not very good at making decisions. Perhaps the Australian Labor Party will call a special conference in respect of this matter. In fact, I suggest that it might even take advantage of the conference that it is having on Monday to get the permission of the union movement to pay Austudy to students at private tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Private tertiary education will not go away. It is here to stay. It is good for students and it is good for Australia. The sooner the Labor Party comes to grips with this concept the better. I encourage it to rethink its attitude to students in respect of Austudy entitlements at Bond University and also in respect of the availability of graduate scholarships for Bond University and the other private universities which will soon be on stream. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the adjournment debate tonight I would like to mention an issue of extreme importance in my electorate of Prospect. It concerns an article in the local press that was circulated some two weeks ago under the heading `Front Page City Jobless Shocker'. The report itself does not reflect the latest trends in employment. It is unreliable and inaccurate. The latest figures show that in August 1990 unemployment in New South Wales was 6.5 per cent. Properly researched figures on unemployment trends reveal that in 1987 New South Wales had an unemployment rate of 8.8 point per cent and in 1989 6.4 per cent, not 7.5 per cent as printed in that particular article. My sources are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1987 the City of Fairfield had a 17.4 per cent unemployment rate. In 1989 the City of Fairfield had an 11.4 per cent unemployment rate. Again, these figures are based on the ABS survey for the publication Developments in Regional Labour Markets. The figures, quoted in the Advance press article, are more than two years out of date. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the number of unemployed in Fairfield is higher than the State average in percentage terms since 1987, there has been a reduction of 33 per cent in the unemployment rate in Fairfield -that is, from 17 per cent to 11.4 per cent in a two-year period. The rate of unemployment reduction in Fairfield is greater than the New South Wales average. Fairfield City is experiencing a period of rapid population growth and change. At the 1986 census the population was 157,850, an increase of 25,500 or 30.54 per cent since 1981. It is estimated that the growth has continued and in fact has increased. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has projected Fairfield growth since 1986 to be over 4 per cent per annum. At June 1990 the estimated population of Fairfield was 180,000. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that the annual increases in population of 4 per cent have not been taken into account when calculating the comparison in the unemployment figures of 1987 to 1990. In recent years there has been a significant decline in unemployment in the region. It is true that Fairfield has had a constantly high number of migrants and refugees. In 1986 Fairfield had the highest number of overseas born residents in Australia, 70,529. The number of overseas born residents increased by over one-third in the five years from 1981 to 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disturbing that a report to the Fairfield Council recommending the launch of a local employment and economic development task force for the Fairfield local government area was completely misreported in the Advance story. In fact, the report, which was presented to the Council's community development and recreation committee, outlined the aims of a proposed local employment and economic development task force which I am certain would receive wide support within our community. The community's expectations are for unemployment programs to assist disadvantaged groups to obtain employment or proceed to further education. As member for Prospect, I reject the assertion in the article that mickey mouse employment schemes are in process. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of our labour market program activity in the Fairfield area include 100 job seekers being assisted under the Jobstart and Jobtrain programs in 1989-90. An increased number is expected in 1991 with funding of $1.8m available. Nationally, the employment access program has been allocated $207.9m for 1990-91 to assist long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged job seekers. These programs are designed, funded and managed with the clear objective of enhancing the capacity of people to compete in the labour market and to gain long-term employment. These programs are not short-term job creation programs which return people to the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference was also made in that same article to the needs of the long-term unemployed in Fairfield. It should be noted that the project effect scheme sponsored by the Wesley Central Mission meets this goal. The program of activities developed in consultation with the office of the Fairfield Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) and reflecting the needs of the local labour market is targeting courses for the long-term unemployed, and in particular adult males, young people, women returning to the work force, migrants with English language difficulties and people from culturally different backgrounds which inhibit their employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> The funding level provided by the Government for this project for 1990 is made up of a main grant of $134,680 and special service grants for older unemployed workers of $60,000 and $65,000. As well, there is Mission Employment Skillshare and Cabramatta Skillshare. I completely agree with the manager of Fairfield CES that there is certainly no room for complacency on the issue of unemployment in our city. I congratulate the CES and those generally committed people who are working to solve this issue. It could be argued that a more positive picture could have been painted than the one that was depicted in the newspaper article. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yesterday in this House I raised the matter of the recently announced Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission losses and the association of these losses with the late Robert Holmes a Court. The remarks I made were based on figures available on the public record. Today in the Western Australian State Parliament Norm Marlborough, MLA, chose to attack the credibility of one of my children in retaliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My son, who is aged 32, married, and who lives independently of my family has had his future employment prospects severely damaged by Marlborough's outrageous, inaccurate and illogical allegations. Mr Marlborough is correct in claiming that my son was once employed by Bell Resources some years ago and that that employment was terminated-as I understand it, by my son's written resignation. Marlborough has apparently claimed in the State Parliament under parliamentary privilege that my son was sacked because he was caught by a security guard `stealing software for use in insider share trading'. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who knows anything about computers knows that software is the programming of a computer. My son was employed by Bell to install a new computer system. He was installing proprietary software to which he had ready access, because it was his business, and personally writing the specialist software that Bell needed to make the overall system work. That was his job. One might wonder why the author, in this case my son, of a product of this nature, namely software, would choose to steal it-in other words, steal the very work he was creating. One might wonder how one does that. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to its specialist application-in other words, linking up proprietary software in a major computer system-one might wonder what he would have done with it when he stole it. It had value only to Bell. It had no value to anyone else, and he was the person creating it. Those with knowledge of the share market might further query how computer programs could be used in the practice of insider trading. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not my son's keeper. He assures me, and I believe his assurances, that during his employment at Bell he did nothing that could be described as improper, let alone illegal. He has never purchased shares, let alone done so with the benefit of insider information. Today the State Leader of the Opposition, Barry MacKinnon, has called upon Marlborough in the State Parliament to produce evidence to support his claim and to produce that evidence under parliamentary privilege. We are not asking him to make these remarks outside the House so that we could follow the well-established Labor practice of suing him. We are just telling him to produce some evidence to support this claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt that he will do it. He could bring the security guard along. I would be interested to know how a security guard in particular would recognise software if he saw it being stolen. The argument is illogical.</PARA>
<PARA> I am further interested as to why a person from the union movement and a member of the Labor Party, presumably with the permission of the Premier of Western Australia, has chosen to come out in defence of a business tycoon. Why attack one of my kids to try to improve the image of Robert Holmes a Court-unless, of course, such people are terrified, as they are, of the ever obvious links between them, Holmes a Court and, of course, WA Inc. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the State Parliament, subsequent to my remarks here, the State Opposition has produced documentation to prove that Holmes a Court banked $50m in Rothwells Bank immediately after having received hundreds of millions of dollars from the State Government Insurance Commission to buy properties which he could not sell on the open market. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Government has attacked my kid. But has it thought of what it has done to him? He is still in the computer business; he works there every day; every day he handles the confidential information of his clients. What is the likelihood that some of this mud will stick-mud thrown at me? I am the person they wanted to hurt-Wilson Tuckey-and I am big enough to cop it. Marlborough, Walsh, Keating, Dawkins and the rest of them: they can all have a go at me. I will take them on and beat them at their own game. But why pick on one of my kids and why take the opportunity to destroy his future employment? He is married. He has a four-weeks-old son. I think it is disgraceful, and I call upon the Western Australian Parliament to condemn this man. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NT4">Dr CATLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Adelaide)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.40)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to the proposal to develop a multifunction polis (MFP) in Adelaide. The idea was originally conceived in deliberations between officials of the Ministry for International Trade and Industry (MITI) in Japan, but was subsequently developed in discussions with the Australian Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. Honourable members will be well aware that subsequently a joint steering committee took submissions from a number of States and that South Australia emerged as the preferred site. The matter has excited some controversy in Melbourne, where the Rainbow Alliance has promised to get a million signatures against the idea. I would have thought there were plenty of items to keep the Melbourne Left busy in Victoria, but who am I to complain?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The site of the MFP is chiefly in the electorate of Port Adelaide, some in Makin, but many of my electors will be affected by it. Some have already raised the matter with me. They are concerned about a number of matters. First, they are worried that the project may be a wholly Japanese city or enclave. While it is true that some Japanese may be residents as researchers, of the overall projected population of 100,000, 80 per cent will in fact be Australian and many of the rest will be non-Japanese nationals. Some Japanese companies will be involved, but so will companies from many other countries, including Australia. Adjacent to the MFP site is Technology Park, which already employs 2,000 research based workers in corporations from a wide number of countries, again including a number of Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid some confusion has developed here between the old proposal to develop a Japanese retirement village, which was refused by this Government and has been long since rejected, and the present MFP proposal. This is an unfortunate confusion. Secondly, they are concerned that the site may be badly contaminated by a hundred years of industrial pollution and 40 years of pretty intensive garbage disposal, which has actually elevated the site, during the 20 years that I have lived in the area, by about 100 feet. I can appreciate their worries. My first profession, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you are not aware, was as a garbage collector, so I have an interest in garbology. </PARA>
<PARA> Prerequisite to the development will be a clean-up of the site, and the first task of the environmental management group within the MFP would be an extensive environmental impact study and then a clean-up. That clean-up would have to include not only the site itself but the environs, including the river and the mangrove swamp. In this sense, site enhancement would be a positive virtue rather than a drawback. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, some of my voters worry that the development may divert scarce resources away from their own and their children's well-being and towards that of foreign corporations. That is not an idle concern and it is one that, again, has to be treated seriously since this is a matter that has occurred in other countries. It is a real concern then that must be addressed. But it has to be offset against the fact that Adelaide's growing population has to be settled somewhere and it has to be gainfully employed. </PARA>
<PARA> The MFP proposal offers the possibility of residential areas fairly close to the central business district and the attendant cultural institutions, to tidal water and generous parkland development which will go along with the project. It will offer employment not only in advanced sunrise high technology industries, which would be the core of the proposal, but also in cultural, recreational and environmental management industries and those related to its construction and servicing. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out, however, that I concur with my old colleague from the University of Adelaide, Gavin McCormack, who is now at the Australian National University as Professor of Asian Studies. He has complained that the largest single proposal so far developed to consult publicly on the MFP is to be undertaken in Sydney at a cost which is going to be about $1,000 for two days. It is quite true that this is being privately organised, but it is also correct to say that its location and cost makes it hard for my constituents and, indeed, for my poor self as a meagrely paid backbencher, to attend such a proposition. I trust that at some time in the future we will be able to organise a similar but much cheaper conference in Adelaide to ensure that the process of public consultation is fairly undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the proposal is a good idea, has the capacity to accommodate much of Adelaide's population growth in the near future, can contribute to the development of high technology industries in this country, and improve the standard of living of some of my constituents. However, at the present time there is some confusion and some opposition. If this opposition and confusion in the community is not assuaged, as I believe it can be, then the proposition may yet well have to be shelved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight, like the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), with a concern. My concern is not, however, with the multifunction polis or the very fast train or any other practical matters. My concern is with a little piece of plastic, a number. We call it, in this country today, the tax file number. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, a few years ago-as I am sure everyone on this side of the House remembers-a device called the Australia Card. Remember the Australia Card, the ID card, the perfect vehicle for uniform and universal population control? Terrific device, was it not? Just about everybody on every side of politics in Australia had a go at the Australia Card. I cannot recall anybody, from John Halfpenny to Gough Whitlam to Malcolm Fraser and everybody in between, who was happy about the Australia Card. Now we have the tax file number. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) tells us that the tax file number is a device which has a great deal of integrity. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) tells us that the tax file number has a great degree of integrity. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) would claim the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I have to advise the House that information has recently come to my attention about an immigrant who is not an immigrant-a visitor who came into our country on a visitor's visa and, while he was here, decided it was such a great place he would like to go to work. So what did he do? Doing the right thing, he went down to the Australian Taxation Office and he applied for a tax file number. The Commissioner of Taxation is so busy trying to catch all those tax cheats out there in corporate land Australia, that he sort of forgot to ask this bloke whether he had any qualifications to work in Australia and whether, in fact, he had any documentation that would allow him to stay here. Of course he did not because he was only a visitor. Nonetheless, he did obtain a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA> He went to work-work that our kids could use, work that the hundreds of thousands out there at the moment on unemployment benefits are looking for. In the process of working he managed to hurt himself. He lives in the State of Victoria-this gentleman who visited our shores to have a look at Australia and decided to work and got a tax file number-and when he got hurt his employer, of course, was covered by WorkCare, this great universal welfare system for the injured that we subsidise with our taxes in the beautiful bankrupt State of Victoria. </PARA>

He got hurt, so he went to the boss and the boss put him on WorkCare. Now we have this visitor to our shore with a tax file number and he is off work visiting the country by courtesy of the Victorian taxpayer on WorkCare. Is it not terrific? Do honourable members like the story? Let us go on with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the bloke's visa ran out. That caused him great problems, so he has come to my office to ask for assistance: Please can he get an extension of his visa so he can stay in Australia to make sure he gets well under WorkCare?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As every member of this House is aware, of all the issues that have developed in the public mind over the last 10 years or so, concern for our environment would have to rank as one of the most important. It has been amazing how quickly and strongly the wider community has fallen in behind the environmental movement, particularly when one considers that it was only a few years ago that environmentalists were looked upon as a fringe group with no credibility and very little public support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As most of us, I believe, in this House would appreciate, it has been most fortunate that environmentalism has now taken its rightful place in the political spectrum as a core issue. In 1990 we are aware of the follies of the past and we realise that development needs to be judged against what our environment has been able to sustain. I believe that the effective application of that ideal has been one of the great strengths of the Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, for current community environmental awareness to be expanded and carried into the future, it is vital that our young people are given a balanced educational grounding on the issues involved. The three tiers of government-Federal, State and local-can only do so much in that direction. Other elements in our community, including parents and private industry, need to play their part in reinforcing the message. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where our school system has an important role to play. From my visits to schools in my electorate of Fowler, I have gained the observation that a great deal is being done in that direction. Almost every school has an environmental program in place in addition to its curriculum work, and some have come up with very innovative and interesting schemes to encourage students to appreciate environmental issues. Some have been organised in conjunction with parents and citizens associations, some with local business houses, and others through a combination of private and public support. </PARA>
<PARA> One such environmental awareness program which deserves to be mentioned in this House has been introduced by a very forward-looking school in my electorate-Ashcroft High School. The program, which is called `Adopt a Tree', involves the nomination of students as parents of trees. The trees are donated to the school by Liverpool City Council and then planted in appropriate school locations. Under the scheme, two students are nominated as the parents of each tree. They are given adoption papers and a photograph of their tree, and then are charged with the responsibility of nurturing it and ensuring its well-being. Any advice that is needed is available from Liverpool Council, and photographs are taken twice a year to record a tree's growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme was implemented by the Principal, Mr Bob Henley, following the original suggestion by the school council, and Liverpool Council's indication that it would be prepared to donate young trees for such a cause. Bob Henley saw the scheme as a practical way to both help students in their environmental studies and encourage a responsible attitude in this area of local development. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Ashcroft High School and Liverpool City Council both deserve hearty congratulations on their respective roles in this initiative. It is a great idea which will invariably give the students involved a different perspective on the relationship between people and nature. </PARA>
<PARA> For Liverpool Council, it is an expense which will be repaid tenfold in the years to come as our children in south-western Sydney come of age with an appreciation of the importance of environmental restraint. Even in this age of emerging environmentalism, the cost to councils of our throwaway society can be measured in many thousands of dollars. I am a great believer in the saying that people who have been directly involved in practical conservation programs will tend to be more inclined to support policies which protect the environment than others who just read about them in books. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday, I had the pleasure of attending one of the first tree planting ceremonies at Ashcroft High School. I was most impressed by the attitude of the students involved, their desire to get on with the job of looking after their adopted trees and their knowledge of environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Principals such as Bob Henley deserve our support in their willingness to use innovative and interesting teaching methods in the cause of the environment. They are methods which, from my observations, are highly successful and beneficial to the future welfare of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to provide the House with some background information on the 8/7 Battalion of the Royal Victoria Regiment, the headquarters of which are located in my electorate. The 8/7 encompasses a large area and has subunits located at Shepparton, Echuca, Bacchus Marsh, Mildura, Swan Hill, Warrnambool, Portland, Hamilton and Maryborough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The unit's history dates back to 23 October 1857, when a meeting of the Ballarat citizens was held to consider the possibility of establishing a rifle corps in the district. Following representations to the government of the colony of Victoria, assent was received for the enrolment of a corps on 21 July 1858. The first parade of the new unit was held, I believe, on 9 August 1858. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it has existed under a variety of titles, the battalion has existed since that date with an uninterrupted history. The battalion has also links with the past through the subunits located at Shepparton and Mildura. These companies can trace a lineage to the 59th Battalion, the Hume Regiment, and the 7th Battalion, the North West Murray Borderers. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of the 3rd Division, the task of the 8/7 is the defence of vital assets in the north of Australia. The battalion played an active role in exercise Kangaroo 89 and during that operation its strength, discipline and leadership were accorded due recognition. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel D.J. Ball and his predecessors the battalion has grown into an extremely strong unit. Under Lieutenant-Colonel Ball's command the battalion has increased its number of companies. Indeed, it was retitled the 8/7 on 14 November 1987. On 26 November 1983 the then 2nd Battalion was granted the freedom of entry to the city of Ballarat to parade in the city, and the freedom was exercised on the same day. I can tell the House it really was a magnificent occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of exercise Kangaroo 89 the battalion's area of operation revolved around the defence of Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal. This included the vital asset protection of navigation aids, control towers, radar and 75 Squadron RAAF assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The officers based at Ballarat include Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Ball; the Second-in-Command is Major Doug Hasson, who is a graduate from the Royal Military College Duntroon; the Adjutant is Captain Mark Elliott, who attended Saint Patrick's College at Ballarat; and the Regimental Sergeant Major is Warren Payne. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my very great pleasure recently to be a guest at the 8/7 training exercise at Puckapunyal. Men and women from the 8/7 completed a two-week training course which was a valuable exercise for them personally and also for the battalion. A number of battalion members were also there to carry out various promotion courses. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my very great honour to have a close association with the 8/7. It is an important and integral part of the Ballarat community, and I am anxious to ensure not only the battalion's viability but also that it goes from strength to strength. The battalion personnel have a strong sense of commitment to the defence of our country and represent the very best of our civilian forces. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very short time left available to me I also support the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in the comments he made tonight. I think it is a despicable act that someone's son is treated with such contempt. The honourable member for O'Connor is a big man and he can stand up for himself. I, personally, take very grave objection to members of his family being involved in this way. I am sure that would be an attitude taken by members from both sides of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government provides direct support for energy research through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (NERD&amp;) Program. The Program is funded from three sources:</PARA>
<PARA> the Energy Research Trust Account, which is funded through appropriation in the Commonwealth Budget and which provides support for research in all energy technology areas; the Renewable Energy Research Trust Account which provides additional appropriation funds for research projects in the fields of renewable energy and energy conservation; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Coal Research Trust Account, funded by a levy on coal production, which provides support for research into all aspects of coal.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no universally accepted definition of alternative energy and it is often used to cover alternative transport fuels (eg. natural gas, oil shale, coal or oil derived synthetic fuels) and/or renewable energy (eg. solar, wind, geothermal, biomass). With the exception of coal derived synthetic fuels, alternative energy research is only eligible for funding from Budget appropriations via the Energy Research Trust Account or the Renewable Energy Research Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989-90 financial year Commonwealth appropriations under the Energy Research Trust Account and the Renewable Energy Research Trust Account totalled $10.6 million and $0.9 million respectively. Over this period $10.8 million was allocated for coal related research projects from the Coal Research Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Until recently, NERD&amp; Program grants were awarded by the Minister for Resources following the receipt of recommendations from the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) and its Technical Standing Committees. However, in future, non-coal related energy research grants will be awarded by the Energy Research and Development Corporation which was formed on 2 July 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the 1989-90 financial year, applications for research projects covering all energy areas were advertised in the national press in March 1989. In addition applications for research projects relating specifically to lightweight gas cylinders for natural gas fuelled vehicles were advertised in the national press in December 1989. On both occasions advertisements appeared in the following newspapers: the Financial Review, the Australian, Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age, Adelaide Advertiser, Courier Mail, West Australian, the Mercury, NT News and the Canberra Times.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A total of 169 grant applications were received in the 1989-90 financial year seeking support for research in the areas of alternative transport fuels, renewable energy, energy conservation, nuclear fusion and the environmental, social and economic implications of energy use. The number of applications received and awarded by each Technical Standing Committee are outlined in the table below.</PARA>

<PARA> The number which could be classified as alternative energy will depend on the definition used.</PARA>
<PARA> (5), (6), (7) A total of $12.0 million was committed in the 1989-90 financial year for research projects dealing with the production and use of alternative transport fuels, renewable energy, energy conservation and the social, economic and environmental implications of using energy. These projects are included in the list of energy research grants announced by Senator Peter Cook on 23 November 1989 (copy attached).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) In the past, the guidelines for NERD&amp; Program grant applications have been issued and reviewed annually by NERDDC and approved by the Minister for Resources. In developing Program priorities, NERDDC has taken account of the views of State Governments, industry associations and companies operating in the energy sector. In future this function will be undertaken by Energy Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>There are specific requirements that the Energy Research and Development Corporation must adhere to in this regard. These requirements, which are laid down under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act (1989), require the Corporation to prepare a Five Year R&amp; Plan which includes a statement of its objectives and priorities for that period. Before preparing the Plan the Corporation must consult and have regard to the views expressed by each of its representative organisations (the Australian Gas Association, Australian Institute of Energy, Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association and the Electricity Supply Association of Australia). The Plan is then submitted to the Minister for Resources for approval.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Corporation is required to prepare an Annual Operating Plan for each financial year. This Plan is also required to be submitted to the Minister for Resources for approval and copies of the Plan provided at the same time to the representative organisations.</PARA>
