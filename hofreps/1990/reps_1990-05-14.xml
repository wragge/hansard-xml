<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My maiden question without notice is directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations. Is the Minister aware of reports that Australia is ill-prepared for reforms in services trade? Can he advise honourable members whether Australia has been supportive of the inclusion of trade in services in the Uruguay Round negotiations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="363" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="TRADE NEGOTIATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the honourable member's question, I would say, first of all, that Australia has been very supportive of developing a services agreement in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am also aware of the reports in the Weekend Australian of 5 and 6 May headlined that Australia was ill-prepared for reforms in service trade. I must say that that headline is without foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government believes that services are a vital sector of the Australian economy, providing over two-thirds of Australia's gross domestic product. Tradable services include tourism, banking and finance, computer software, transport and education. For example, in 1988-89 tourism was Australia's biggest earner of foreign exchange. Therefore, we have strongly supported the inclusion of trade in services for the first time in a round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Government is very well prepared for possible multilateral services agreements by the end of the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA> A comprehensive work program extending back several years has included surveys on problems faced by Australia in the area of trade in services and an intensive program of consultations with industry associations, companies, unions and State and Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consults widely with other departments in Canberra to ensure that services negotiating objectives are compatible with the micro-economic reform agenda being considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In the Uruguay Round negotiations Australia initiated and continues to chair the informal group of around 20 developed countries and more pragmatic developing countries now at the centre of efforts to forge an effective framework by July. Australia will continue its active involvement, given the importance of trade and service to Australia's future and will continue to closely involve industry and State governments in this process. Australia certainly intends that a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round will include a comprehensive service agreement embodying non-discrimination, transparency, equal rights of treatment and an effective dispute settling mechanism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Prime Minister accept the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer that the admonition of Senator Button was `long overdue'? If so, will the Prime Minister now reconsider and, in fact, fire Senator Button?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of firing Senator Button was not in the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister. It has never been in his mind and has never been in mine. The question is irrelevant. The simple fact is that the Deputy Prime Minister, as he said, is in a position where he knows where the engine rooms for change in this Government have been. With appropriate accuracy and modesty he identified himself and the Prime Minister. In a situation where he knows the facts in regard to the dynamics of change there was a certain element of frustration in his mind-understandable, in my view-that there could have been left an impression that there were others who were more eager for change than either him or me. He gave vent to that frustration in his interview. I do not feel uncomfortable about it. I do not think that Senator Button is particularly uncomfortable about it either. The question of the sacking of Senator Button is an absurdity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Trade Negotiations been drawn to an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report on agricultural protectionism released for publication this weekend? What is the Government's response to this important report?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="364" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="TRADE NEGOTIATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The response of the Government to this report from the OECD issued this weekend on the costs of agricultural protectionism is a very positive one. As honourable members can recall, last week, when referring to the visit of the Director-General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade organisation to Australia, I stressed the importance to Australia of a successful agricultural outcome in the present Uruguay negotiations. The importance of agriculture in these negotiations is very much underwritten by this report from the OECD released in Paris this weekend. The report covers a study of the cost to consumers of protectionist agricultural policies in OECD countries. Of the 22 countries examined it found consumers in those 22 countries last year paid a total of $US104 billion in higher prices and transfers through the taxation system to support distorted and protectionist agricultural policies. The consumers in the European Community paid almost $US41 billion in 1989 as a result of protective measures while Japanese consumers paid $US34 billion and consumers from the United States paid $US15 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report finds that Australia has such a low level of agricultural protection that in this country the consumers pay the second lowest financial penalty of all the OECD nations. Only New Zealand consumers pay a smaller penalty. The report finds that not only do agricultural policies entail high costs to consumers but also restrict consumer choice and contribute to environmental damage. It concludes that while agricultural policies are largely financed directly by consumers the interests of consumers are generally not taken into account as much as those of producers in the development of these policies.</PARA>
<PARA> The report very much supports Australia's position in urging vigorous efforts at national and international levels towards reforms of protectionist agricultural policies and action at a national level to give greater weight to consumer interest in decision-making on agricultural policy. The report's suggestions for action by the OECD governments are fully consistent with Australia's policies on agricultural reform and trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the existing procedures within Australia to allow representation of consumer interest and to calculate the cost of agricultural assistance measures, the report favourably comments on the actions taken in this country in the preparation of its recommendations. Discussions have already been held with consumer organisation about raising consumer awareness on agricultural policy issues in this country, and these recommendations will be referred to those consumer organisations to improve our performance in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister received an offer of resignation from the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, following the Senate's censure of him last Thursday? If so, has the Prime Minister accepted that resignation and, if not, in the light of the fact that the Senate no longer has confidence in Senator Tate and in the light of his obvious appalling lack of judgment, will the Prime Minister now sack Senator Tate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a remarkable question. The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is no, I have not received it; therefore, having not received it, I have not had to make any decision about it. The last part of the honourable member's question is indeed remarkable. I am told that Senator Tate no longer has the confidence of that collection of people who make up the majority in the Senate. Then who are they? The Liberals, the National Party, and the Democrats-that coalition of political opportunists beyond measure; there has never been anything like it in the history of this country. To suggest that the attitude they adopted in this matter in the Senate represented some view of principle and that they had put their hands up in terms of some concept of principle rather than as they always do with political opportunism is an absurdity. The fact that Senator Tate did not receive the confidence of a majority of those people in the Senate is absolutely irrelevant to the question as to whether he has the confidence in the House where it matters. Governments are formed in this place, and Senator Tate has my confidence, he has the confidence of the Government and he has the confidence of the majority of the people in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An incessant theme of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last election campaign, which he repeated dozens and dozens of times, was that, if you cannot govern yourself, you cannot govern the country. In the 50-odd days that we have had since that election, we have seen overwhelming evidence of the accuracy of that statement in relation to his Government. The situation has now totally degenerated into a shambles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had conflicting statements from a range of Ministers on key policy issues. We have had personal attacks and abuse among Government Ministers and other Government members. We have ignorance of the plight of the economic circumstances of all Australians. Enormous uncertainty is being created in the business community and beyond about where this country is at present, where it is going and the damage that will be done by the persistence of high interest rate policies of this Government. And, of course, we have a total neglect of the proper role of the Parliament in just the first week and a bit that this Parliament has been back in operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, on the fourth anniversary of the now infamous and internationally damaging banana republic statement by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), he deliberately-I emphasise the word `deliberately'-chose to mount a scathing attack on a fellow Cabinet Minister. This was not just any Cabinet Minister but the third most important in the Government, whose only crime, it seems, was to have disagreed with the Treasurer in his assessment of our current economic circumstances and, in particular, about the required pace of policy response. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally unprecedented for somebody in the Treasurer's position to make such an attack on a senior Cabinet colleague. He is a Cabinet colleague whose credibility with the electorate and with the business community clearly surpasses that of the Treasurer. There is no doubt in our mind that the Treasurer should resign. If he is not prepared to resign, the Prime Minister should sack him. Indeed, such statements as the Treasurer made today are made only by people on their way out the door, either when they are just about to resign or when they have just resigned. The only reason that the Prime Minister has not attacked the Treasurer, pulled him into line and called for his resignation is that he undoubtedly fears that this is the first stage of the Treasurer's run for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. The leadership is now a very real and a very live issue on that side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Treasurer has obviously been frustrated by a series of events. The criticism of his past Cabinet performance by Senator Walsh is one example. Another source of frustration has been the criticism of his performance by a host of others. The fact that the portfolio of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has been deliberately broadened-he has been given a domestic portfolio-and the fact that the father and son relationship exists between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications have obviously got under the Treasurer's skin. Of course, even Simon Crean, a new Minister, has been given a run. For the first time, mark my words, leadership is a real issue and live issue on the Government's side. This is the first time in four parliamentary terms that this has been the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote questions asked by a reporter and statements made by the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you acknowledge it's a remarkable step for you to come out here and publicly admonish Senator Button like this?</PARA>
<PARA>What was the Treasurer's answer? It was:</PARA>
<PARA> No, it is just overdue; it is just long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA>He makes those sorts of statements only when his vision goes beyond the job he currently has-that is, to the top job in this country, namely, the position of Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth drawing the House's attention to the Treasurer's other statements today. The Treasurer opened his remarks by saying that Senator Button:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . has created the impression that he, amongst others, that he has a more ambitious program for reform than that which the Government is generally adopting or which, by inference, is being adopted by the Prime Minister or me.</PARA>
<PARA>He says that this is not true-a direct and a blatant criticism of some remarks made by Senator Button, most recently yesterday. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Now can I say in a discussion we had a week or so ago on protection in relation to cars and protection generally, I wanted to go further than Senator Button as is usual on these two issues. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to basically and fairly clinically bucket Senator Button's performance in Cabinet, taking the opportunity to reveal details of Cabinet discussions and debate which have, before this time, not been released. He attacked Senator Button for servicing his client base, and then said:</PARA>
<PARA>So, I made it quite clear to the Cabinet and to Senator Button they regarded his proposal for a private arrangement with the car firms for another five or seven years is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on and gave more and more details of the nature of the internal Cabinet room debates on the issue of protection, all designed, of course, to attack his colleague and to make statements of his position, which he has never been prepared to make in this Parliament, on major issues of economic policy debate. This comes on the heels of two instances last week where the Treasurer also made major statements which were not made to the Parliament, his principal responsibility. The first was his statement on the Government's position on consumption tax, a dramatic U-turn from the position he had taken in 1985 and one of the least substantive pieces of analysis-analysis is too good a word-that has appeared on the issue of the consumption tax in the entire period since the middle 1970s, when that issue was first raised significantly in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Then last Friday in a briefing to the Economic Planning Advisory Council he gave a statement on the state of the economy where he again made some fairly substantive remarks that should have been made in this House in response to questions or by way of ministerial statement. The Treasurer has a total disregard for the standing of the Parliament and for his responsibilities in respect of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point of our censure motion on the Prime Minister is to emphasise his failure to dismiss the Treasurer for what has been a flagrant, premeditated and unprecedented breach of Cabinet solidarity this morning, coming on the back of what has been a total disregard for the due processes of the Parliament by this man over many years, but on several occasions in just the last seven or eight days. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue we want to bring to the attention of the Prime Minister as a basis of censure of the Prime Minister is his failure to dismiss Senator Tate. The Opposition, in the spirit of our approach to the fourth term of the Hawke Government, has a strong desire, as I said last week, to raise the standard of parliamentary debate and to raise the significance and the importance of Parliament in the eyes of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the fact that those people had voted significantly against both major parties in the last election-something of a plague on both Houses-we took a careful and measured approach to the statements by Senator Tate. We raised a series of questions. We provided him with his opportunity in terms of his responsibilities to the Parliament to answer the questions of his Senate colleagues and then to answer the issue of censure in the Senate before we publicly went hard-line on what should be the Prime Minister's position, as I did last Friday: that if Senator Tate was not prepared to resign, given that it was such an open and shut case, the Prime Minister should sack him. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate, in the process of that censure debate, actually laid himself on the mercy of the Senate, effectively pleaded guilty, and asked the Senate to judge him according to that call for mercy. The Senate overwhelmingly voted against him. The central point here is that Senator Tate should have offered his resignation-and I am very surprised that he did not offer it-but in the circumstances of the breach of ministerial responsibility that was the basis of the case, he should have been made to resign. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate occupies the central role in the administration of law in this country. As Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs he is required to meet particularly high standards. He is required to show, above all, probity and neutrality in relation to the administration of the law and the courts. Senator Tate clearly failed in his fundamental duty as Minister for Justice in his comments to the media about a current drug prosecution. His failure to resign should have left the Prime Minister with no alternative but to sack him. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister should have forced his resignation for a number of reasons, but the principal reason, the open and shut nature of this case, was his reversal of the fundamental onus of proof by pronouncing somebody guilty before trial. That, apart from anything else, should have been the principal reason why Senator Tate should have been dismissed by the Prime Minister. Senator Tate, more than most others in this Parliament, would have a very clear understanding of that basic principle, having been for many years a lecturer in law and, indeed, for part of this time dean of a law school, and having had a number of years of practical legal experience. That, apart from any other reason, should have been a basis for the dismissal of Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's letter to the Prime Minister, for example, stated that Senator Tate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . had lent the authority of his office to a positive assertion that the person arrested in Thailand was guilty. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems from a newspaper report on the weekend that the Attorney-General, in fact, thought Senator Tate should have gone. They can perhaps confirm that in the course of this debate. Given the nature of the breach, the experience of the man and his understanding of the law, he should have gone. There should be no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the debate the other day in the Senate Senator Tate admitted that he knew about the arrest of the defendants in Australia. So I put it to the House that he must have had some idea that a trial was pending. It was interesting and particularly noteworthy in the circumstances that he chose to make a major media event of those statements in the way that he did. So he must take responsibility also for the failure of his office in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been told that his office was informed about the sensitive nature of the circumstances and that if he had a press conference he was not to mention a particular Australian connection. We are told that he was not told by his office the detail of that call, but he must have had some idea about it. He has been well briefed on the issue, he has followed the issue, he has read the newspapers and in the end he must take responsibility for his office even if it is not his particular failure. </PARA>
<PARA> He was apparently warned on the way to Melbourne by the Director of Public Prosecutions that his statements may cause a problem. It seems that he made no attempt to do anything about that after those statements had been made. Finally, we have the whole effort that took place last week with the exchange of letters between the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister, whose sole purpose, I would suggest to the House, was to divert attention from the real issue, namely, the reversal of guilt and to try to play down or diffuse the issue before it was raised in an appropriate way through both Houses of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So I have no doubt, on the basis of what Senator Tate said, the way he behaved in relation to his defence in the Senate and the way the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister sought to divert attention from the real issue in that debate, that it is a very clear-cut case that Senator Tate should have resigned. When he did not resign the Prime Minister should have sacked him. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and fourth elements of the basis of our censure of the Prime Minister today relate to persistent weakness in failing to exercise proper control over statements by Ministers in relation to major policy issues which have led to a lack of public confidence and the related point, their inability to declare and promote a coherent and consistent economic policy. Let us consider the run of comments we have seen among senior Ministers just since the election campaign. I am picking out only the major ones. We have had consistent statements by Senator Walsh which have only really brought personal attack and abuse. People are not debating the substance of his criticisms, which they know to be right. We have had statements by Mr Dawkins, who is calling for a major statement on micro reform. He has ruled out privatisation as an item on the Government's policy agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had Mr Willis admitting that the country is in a technical recession, being backed up least in the broad by Mr West. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley, ruling out virtually every option for micro reforms as he has gone from one media interview to the next being confronted by questions about issues in relation to the aviation industry or other aspects of micro reform. We have seen him progressively narrowing the scope for potential micro reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had statements by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce on consumption tax which have conflicted with those of the Treasurer and we have had statements, most recently yesterday, by Senator Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, about the inappropriateness of talking about rising living standards in what are now very difficult economic circumstances in this country. Indeed, he directly conflicted with statements made by the Treasurer in the course of the election campaign where the Treasurer said, for example, that he could see an increase in real wages in each of the next three years. Senator Button, in the context of some remarks by Senator Walsh, and Senator Walsh, both clearly put paid to that sort of statement. </PARA>
<PARA> But there should be no doubt that this Government has failed to set out a workable economic strategy for this country. The Government's vision cut out on 24 March. Its leaders have no policies. The Treasurer, in every press release and on every occasion on which he comments on economic data, simply puts the same sorts of arguments, `She'll be right; don't worry; the strategy is working'. In the meantime the country is sliding into the worst recession that we have seen, at least since 1982-83 and perhaps in the entire post-war period. We have not got to the worst parts of that recession yet, with average Australian families seeing their homes put at risk and in many cases being forced to sell them; with no significant prospect of a significant and sustainable fall in interest rates by the end of the year; record levels of personal bankruptcies and small business failures; a current account deficit that is nowhere near his objective of 2 3/4 per cent of gross domestic product in the next three years-running 5 to 6 per cent of GDP-which he knows he will not achieve; and inflation locked in at 8 to 9 per cent, with debt still accelerating. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's international standing has been downgraded twice in three years and the Treasurer, time after time, statement after statement, press release after press release, simply denies that there is any sort of problem, that there is any issue to which he should be directing himself. When the going gets tough and his colleagues, for example, say, `We are in recession', what does he say? He says, `We are not in recession'. There is some crazy definition of a technical recession, for example, which everybody else in the world accepts but him. We are not going to meet that, even though we seem to be meeting the basic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> But our final point and the key point in relation to rounding off this censure motion against the Prime Minister has been his failure to demonstrate the quality of leadership that is required for the effective government of the nation in such difficult economic circumstances. There could not be a better comment on that than the four previous points on which we have based this censure motion. He has lost control of his troops. He has got a number two who is already running for the number one spot. He has got a recent Cabinet Minister who knows better than anybody else just how spineless this Government has been in terms of taking the key economic decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple position is this: the Prime Minister has engineered the problems; he has no vision and he totally lacks the guts to put the appropriate policies in place that would turn this country around. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has constructed an attack on the basis of a false premise. You will notice, Mr Speaker, how terrified I am by this attack that has been mounted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating). The whole foundation of this attack that has been made upon me by the Leader of the Opposition is that the Deputy Prime Minister has now made the grand attack on the Prime Minister and that this is all part of a carefully calculated plot to undermine the Prime Minister. Well, I only hope that the Leader of the Opposition, those behind him and those advising him will keep on thinking that way because, if their thinking is that distorted, they will continue in this Parliament to be as ineffective as they have in the previous three.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us examine the question of whether this Government has a particular policy which it has put to the people and which it has pursued and will continue to pursue, which seems to be at the forefront of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. We have, of course, just come through an election where the people had the opportunity of making a decision as between the policies which I put forward on behalf of this party and this Government for the conduct of economic policy and the future direction of this country or the position of those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition said-one of the few accurate things he had to say-that I said and repeated during that campaign, with very considerable effect I believe, that if a party is not capable of governing itself then it is not capable of governing the country. Indeed, the people of this country, in very difficult economic circumstances, with high interest rates-indeed they were suffering from the application of the tough economic policy of this Government-found the alternative absolutely wanting. They found it wanting because they saw an Opposition which had no idea of what was involved in formulating policy for this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That was evident in so many different areas of its affairs but in no particular area more obvious than it was in regard to health. The Opposition had seven years in Opposition and so deep are its divisions-not only within the Liberal Party of Australia but between the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia-that it was not able to go to the Australian people with any policy at all in that area. It is from that position that the Leader of the Opposition seeks to draw some analogy between the events of recent days and since the election. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not attempt to disguise the fact that I can draw no comfort from the observations of an ex-Minister. It is no pleasure to me to hear Senator Walsh saying things about the Government in general, or me in particular. Indeed, I would be a very strange Prime Minister if I were to say, `I am very pleased about the things that Senator Walsh has got to say'. But let me make this point to the Leader of the Opposition: insofar as he attempted to support paragraphs (c) and (d) of his censure motion by referring to the observations of Senator Walsh, they are absolutely irrelevant. Senator Walsh is no longer a Minister and, in that sense, his remarks are not to be seen as conflicting observations upon the policy coming from a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor would it be sensible of me to say, nor do I say, that I find any particular comfort or joy in the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister found it necessary to make the comments he did today, but I understand the sense in which he made them and the reason why he made them. If one looked at the comments that were made and what was read into them by Senator Button one would be left with the impression that there were others ahead of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in their concern for the pace of reform in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me briefly indicate to the House and the Leader of the Opposition the order of achievement in the period before this fourth Hawke Labor Government, which is the source of the pride which the Treasurer has, which I share, and which led him to make the observations he did. Let me mention these things. We hear this stupid laughter coming from the Opposition but none of that stupid laughter can, in any sense, refute any one of the facts which I now put-facts of achievement during the third term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In that period Australia had record business investment levels of which everyone in this country can be proud. Those record business levels were created by the explicit policies of this Government. Very simply, we achieved considerable real wage restraint that led to higher profit levels which went into record investment levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, Australia achieved its first public sector surplus. That was the first time in the history of this country. Before, during all those years of conservative government, never once had that Government been able to achieve a public sector surplus, but we did in the last Government. We did it once, we did it again and then we did it a third time. Of course, it follows that as a result the Government made no call on the nation's savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, we cut company tax rates from 49c to 39c. Next, we reorganised the taxation of superannuation. Next, we cut tariffs by around 30 per cent. If one looks at the post-war history of this country, one sees there have been only two occasions on which tariffs have been cut, and both by Labor governments-by 25 per cent under the previous Labor Government and 33 per cent by us two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, Mr Speaker, we lowered assistance to the sugar, tobacco, dried vine fruits and citrus industries. Next, we subjected many areas of telecommunications to competition, areas such as value added services and customer premises equipment. Next, we established a new independent telecommunications regulatory body, Austel. Next we deregulated domestic aviation-the product of the period of government of those opposite, that cosy little relationship, the two airlines agreement. It was this Government during its last term which brought that to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, Mr Speaker, we freed up oil pricing and marketing. Next, we brought in important reforms to government business enterprises. Next, we introduced vital reforms in grain handling, and we did it over the opposition of the conservative parties in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> When we look at that list of achievements, is it any wonder that the Treasurer is somewhat concerned by some suggestion that we had been dragging the chain? At the end of last year I issued a challenge to you fellows and there has been a thundering silence ever since. I asked those opposite whether they really were the custodians of some philosophy and some commitment to micro-economic reform. They would presumably be able to answer my challenge, which was very explicit. Tell me once when within their period of government those opposite came within a bull's roar of that record of micro-economic achievement. And there is still the thundering silence to that challenge which I put to them at the end of last year. They cannot do it, and they cannot do it, firstly, for the simple reason that they did not do it. Secondly, it was not an accident that in all their period of office they did not do anything about micro-economic reform. It is because they have got neither the wit nor the wisdom, the guts nor the facility to deal with the Australian community to bring those results about. </PARA>
<PARA> It is little wonder that my friend and colleague the Deputy Prime Minister was a little upset when one of his colleagues made statements which carried some sort of assumption that this Government had been dragging the chain in the area of micro-economic reform, because the Treasurer, with myself, had been right up there at the forefront of ensuring that that Third Hawke Government had done more in the area of micro-economic reform than had ever been done before. But we were not satisfied with that because during the election campaign, Mr Speaker, I gave my specific commitment to 10 future areas of micro-economic reform during the fourth Hawke Labor Government. Those are the facts, Mr Speaker: a record of unparalleled achievement, and a commitment to ensuring that in the next term we would proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I go quickly to some of the other matters that were mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. He had the unbelievable gall, Mr Speaker, to say that my friend and colleague the Treasurer had gone outside the Parliament to make some statements about certain economic matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make these two comments in particular with regard to that charge-two telling comments. When the Treasurer made his address at the National Press Club, he was not announcing a change of Government policy. In the election campaign our position was crystal clear: no consumption tax in the fourth Hawke Labor Government. So he did not go to the Press Club and announce a change in policy. It was those opposite, outside the Parliament, who changed their position. During the election campaign they told the people of Australia, `Our position is no consumption tax'. But then when they got devastated for the fourth time in an election campaign and all the wheels got turning and the cans of worms were moving about, they decided that they would have a change of position. Did they wait to come into the Parliament to tell the people about their change of policy? Of course they did not; they did it outside. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are talking about changes of position, the Leader of the Opposition might face up to this question. I remind him of what he said on 3 August 1987 in an interview in the Age:</PARA>
<PARA>I'm on record advocating a broad-based consumption tax as an essential part of an overall reform of taxation. I haven't changed my view on that. </PARA>
<PARA>Fair enough-we accept that. But interestingly, the article went on:</PARA>
<PARA> On capital gains and fringe benefits, Hewson says, `I'd go for near uniform taxation of all forms of income'. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if we are talking about constancy and non-change, perhaps the Leader of the Opposition will deign at some time to tell this House why, and under what pressures, he did a U-turn on the question of a capital gains tax. When he was speaking as an unencumbered professor of economics, unpressured by the conservative forces of privilege in the Liberal Party and the National Party, he had a clear view that to have a capital gains tax was right. But once he gets into the Parliament and becomes subject to the pressures of privilege so indelicately manipulated in the Liberal Party--</PARA>

So he has not been successful in his attack upon the Deputy Prime Minister but he certainly has a case to answer in regard to his total U-turn-a capital gains tax, yes, economically correct when he is a professor of economics telling the truth as he sees it; but now, no, he says, `I will just go along and be the easy tool of those who want to prop up privilege in this country'.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was certain that Senator Tate did not know there was a trial.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In seconding this motion, I want to continue with this matter concerning Senator Tate. I must say that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has introduced a particularly new element into this. Even for him, this must be absolutely rock bottom. Desperate as he is, he now calls upon private associations or connections that some of us might have with Senator Tate through the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. Let me tell the Prime Minister one thing about the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship which he might like to pay attention to: one of the things that it subscribes to is putting into practice in one's daily life some basic principles. I would suggest to the Prime Minister that it is about time that he learned what some of the basic principles are so far as his office of Prime Minister is concerned, and I will elaborate on that as we go along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition censures the Prime Minister today in respect of Senator Tate for three reasons. The first is because of Senator Tate's appalling failure to live up to the standards expected of a Minister, both generally and, in the particular case, the standards expected of a Minister for Justice. The second reason is because Senator Tate expressly asked the Senate-and we know that the Prime Minister does not think much of the Senate but it happens under the Constitution of this country to be one of the two Houses of this Parliament-after having pleaded guilty, to expiate him, to forgive him. He asked the Senate for a vote of confidence and the Senate gave him a resounding no. We now have, whether the Prime Minister likes it or not, a Minister in his Government who does not have the confidence of the Senate and, hence, does not have the confidence of the Parliament of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason is because, faced with this quite overwhelming case-it is the only way to describe it-the Prime Minister, instead of acting as a Prime Minister should and demanding the resignation of Senator Tate when his Minister is clearly incompetent and does not have the confidence of the Parliament, acted in the most spineless and unprincipled way and let the Minister stay on. By that means we say that this Prime Minister has demeaned his own office and the principles of ministerial government. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the word principles. It is just as well that we get the principles straight in this matter before we go any further. Frankly, our system of government cannot function properly or with public confidence unless Ministers can pass some basic tests. The first test is that they have to be competent and know what they are doing. Senator Tate has failed that test. Secondly, Ministers must have, and they must show that they have, some basic understanding of the rules that govern their own portfolio. Senator Tate showed that he has no such understanding. Thirdly, they must have the confidence of the Parliament because under our system of government if a Minister does not have the confidence of the Parliament then that Minister has nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> We have these principles straight. If we have them straight then we can look at the three reasons why the Opposition maintains that the Prime Minister should have sacked Senator Tate. Not having done it so far he should do it now. We maintain further that not having done so to this moment the Prime Minister is certainly deserving of being censured by this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the first reason again. It must surely now be obvious to anyone that Senator Tate acted with the grossest incompetence imaginable when he announced to the world at large that a Thai man who had been arrested in Thailand was the No. 1 importer of heroin to Australia. Not only did he announce that to the world but he did so without qualification. At the same time there were three people on trial in Sydney for those exact activities. Not only were they on trial in Sydney for those exact activities but they were on trial in a case where the principal contention of the Crown was that they had dealt with heroin which had been supplied to them from Thailand by this same man whom Senator Tate had branded in public as being guilty. The Minister committed two absolutely vital and fundamental blunders. It must surely be as plain as a pikestaff that he has done that. Senator Tate's first blunder was to make the announcement to the world at large that this man arrested in Thailand was, in fact, guilty. The second blunder he committed was that he aborted a trial in Sydney because, as I have said, the three people in Sydney who were on trial were alleged by the Crown to have been dealing in heroin which that same man had been responsible for shipping from Thailand to Australia. Commonsense would tell one that this is plain incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need to go any further than to remind ourselves of the Prime Minister's own categorisation of this conduct of Senator Tate as an appalling lapse of judgment. This means that if Senator Tate stays in the Ministry the Australian people should understand that the Hawke Government tolerates a tenth-rate standard of performance from its Ministers. It is worse than that. This comes to the very nub of what our case is about. Senator Tate is not just a Minister; he is the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs. He is sworn in to administer the Attorney-General's Department. If anyone should have any understanding of the principles of justice it must surely be a Minister for Justice. That is the primary qualification which this Minister should have. It is the prime defect that Senator Tate obviously does have and he has no justification for remaining in the Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Senator Tate has done for justice what General Jaruzelski did for sunglasses. I cannot see any justification for his remaining and holding out this false claim that he has some basic understanding of the principles of justice, when clearly he does not. Of course, honourable members know that he has had a good teacher, because another Minister in this Government likes to brand people as guilty in public, and that is the Prime Minister. Only one example of that is needed. When the War Crimes Amendment Bill was introduced into this Parliament, the Prime Minister, believe it or not, said in public that people who were to be charged under the War Crimes Amendment Bill, which had not even been passed by the Parliament, would appear to have been guilty. The standard the Prime Minister has set himself is to say in public, of people who are about to be charged with crimes, or who might be charged with crimes, that they are in fact guilty. So, on any test, Senator Tate had a good teacher in this particular matter, and he has learned his lesson well. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for this censure motion with respect to Senator Tate is that he made what he claims is a clean breast of the whole matter. He threw himself on the mercy of the Senate; he virtually pleaded guilty and said to the Senate, `I ask the Senate to indicate by its vote that it wishes me to continue in that particular task.' He said, `Well, I know what I have done; we all know it. We all know the reality. We know all the facts. I ask the Senate to give me a vote of confidence.' The Senate rejected him and gave him a resounding `No'. The Senate was saying, `We have no confidence in you' and, whatever the standing of the Senate may be in the eyes of the Prime Minister, the reality is that one House of this Parliament has censured a Minister in the Hawke Government, and he therefore has no confidence vested in him by the Senate and, for that reason, by the Parliament. It would be bad enough without that censure motion, but it is doubly bad with the censure motion having been passed. Senator Tate's credibility in his State must be the same, and is probably as extinct, as the Tasmanian tiger. He has no basis on which he can hold up his head, or stand or speak with any authority as a Minister of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We come to the third reason-and this brings us to the Prime Minister, which is what this motion of censure is all about. The Prime Minister has a special responsibility. He has a responsibility to maintain public confidence in all his Ministers; he has a responsibility to uphold the principles of ministerial government; and he has a responsibility to act when it is necessary for him to act. This Prime Minister has been here long enough to know that he is a trustee of what has gone before which has been handed down to him and with which he is expected to comply. It is about time that the Prime Minister was reminded of this and that he put these principles into practice. But, of course, we do not have that sort of Prime Minister. We have a Prime Minister who can say in this case, `Well I looked at this and, on balance, I decided not to sack Senator Tate.' This is the flexible Prime Minister with flexible principles. He applies the principles when it suits his convenience and ignores them when it does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing he should have learned by now is, as Gladstone said, `If you are going to be a good Prime Minister, you have to learn to be a good butcher'. A Prime Minister is expected to take firm and resolute decisions when it is necessary for him to do so. There is only way that the Prime Minister can now redeem his position in this particular scandal, and that is for him at last to do the right thing. I do not know what sort of example would influence the Prime Minister. Over the weekend I looked at this question and the closest example I came up with was something that happened during Mr Attlee's Prime Ministership in Britain. This is the way he did it and the way that this Prime Minister should do it if he had enough backbone and gumption to do so, which clearly he does not. Attlee called one of his junior Ministers to 10 Downing Street-a Minister who thought he would be praised for his performance-and Attlee opened up by saying, `I want your job'. The Minister said, `Why, Prime Minister; why?'. Attlee's answer was, `Afraid you are not up to it'. When the facts are presented to a Prime Minister that one of his Ministers is not up to it, it is as simple and straightforward as that. There has been plenty of evidence that Senator Tate is not up to this and, frankly, there is now a lot of evidence accumulating that the Prime Minister himself is not up to it. </PARA>
<PARA> This is all perfectly clear. We have a case of a Minister who has failed dismally to perform his proper ministerial functions; a Minister who clearly is grossly incompetent; and a Minister who-and it is doubly worse for this reason-holds himself out as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs but obviously does not have an inkling of what his responsibilities are or what basic principles of justice he should be applying. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear open and shut case against Senator Tate. He should have been brought to heel from the very time that these facts became known. There is only one clear responsibility on the Prime Minister-one thing for him to do-and that is to dismiss Senator Tate. If he does not do that, he diminishes his own office and the standing of the principles of ministerial government which this country is run along. </PARA>
<PARA> As at this time in this debate the Minister has not been dismissed, our position is very clear-and the position should be very clear to the Prime Minister and to this House: the Prime Minister himself should be censured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a time not so long ago when the censure motion was regarded as an instrument whereby matters of great import could be discussed by the Parliament when the Opposition felt indignant about certain circumstances in public issues or their management. But the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)-again for this Opposition, but for the first time for him-debased this traditional, serious mode of censure which the Parliament's Standing Orders offer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader's speech was very weak. In politics and in this Parliament, if one is going to make a speech with nothing to say, often one is better off saying nothing. This was very much the case with the Leader of the Opposition: he would have been better off not making the speech. Instead, he felt he had to get up and make it. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made an analogy of being mauled by a dead sheep. I could have added another-being hit with a warm lettuce. The fact is that it added up to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that, now in the second week of sitting, not one substantive motion about economic issues or the issues which matter to the Parliament has been moved. In fact, today the Opposition cynically listed on the Notice Paper a matter of public importance regarding the flooding and callously used it as a shield to move a censure motion against the Government, knowing that it was intending to move the censure and that, if a censure motion is moved, there is no matter of public importance. That is known to be the case. Those opposite decided to use the flood victims to suit their own political purposes. They will be judged on them accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there are differences of opinion in a government of change. There are differences of emphasis as well as differences of view. But the healthy foment of discussion which has taken place in the Cabinet of this Government over seven years has been the only effective dialogue of change in this country in the last quarter of a century. Why would such a dialogue not go on? When it becomes a public matter, obviously the press and the Opposition are interested. It was my view today that the inferences drawn from the comments of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) could not be left unanswered, and I answered them. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I do not have the slightest doubt that the positive approach and contribution that Senator Button has employed in his ministerial duties and career in the last seven years he has been industry Minister will continue during the deliberations of this Government. But because those opposite know that the discussion within this Government is the only dialogue of real change-even the bits that fall from the table-they scrummage around trying to lift for their own political purposes and, dare I say, even learn something. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not been asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition in one week and one day because mostly he does not like the answers. I was asked one question by the shadow Treasurer on the second day, I think, and even with that he had to make a bit of an effort. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government did not have the guts to put the policies into place. In last Friday's Australian Financial Review, in a story backgrounded by the Leader of the Opposition obviously, under the heading `Hewson's priority: cut tax rates on middle incomes', we find this:</PARA>
<PARA> But Dr Hewson wants to go much further. </PARA>
<PARA> He wants to reduce the whole middle and top structure of personal income tax. He believes that under Paul Keating, the progressivity of the tax system has been greatly increased-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, its fairness has been greatly improved-</PARA>
<PARA>and that it is time to turn back the tide to increase incentive and encourage initiative . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As if the highest profit share in our history is not enough, as if a 39c corporate rate is not enough, as if the rate of tax on distributed income cut in half from 78c to 47c is not enough: no, we have to flatten the tax rate to give tax cuts to people on the top end of the system and at the middle, as the Leader of the Opposition puts it, because the system has become too progressive. </PARA>
<PARA> Too right, it has become progressive, with things such as the fringe benefits tax, which collects $250m; the capital gains tax, which is now collecting half a billion dollars a year and growing; the tax file number, which is there to deal with fraud and abuse in the system and which Opposition members supported but only after we dragged them to it; and the more rigorous company tax audit system, over which they have constantly attacked the Tax Commissioner. These are the things which have made the tax system more progressive and more fair. At least we can be thankful for the fact that the Opposition has given us credit by saying our tax system is now much more progressive, even if it does not like it. At least the Opposition has acknowledged the fact that Labor has presided over fairer tax systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same newspaper, three pages on under the heading: `Hewson promises visionary rule', it picks up the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the Governor-General's Speech. According to the article, the Leader of the Opposition promised `a revitalised coalition under his leadership which was willing to tackle the tough decisions necessary to overcome Australia's economic problems. He said Australia had become too soft and complacent'. Yet on page 1 he wants to give middle and higher income earners a tax cut. </PARA>
<PARA> That is where he stands. It is back to Box Hill in week one of this leadership. In other words, he is saying, `Look, we have suffered four defeats at the hands of this Government. We do not have a policy structure, we do not have a structure on wages, we do not have a structure on health, we do not have a policy for constraining demand and producing investment and we have a phoney fiscal policy'. Instead of going back to do the solid work, which the Opposition has never done, here it is with reverberations of Box Hill and the Economic Action Plan in week one-the $8 billion of unfunded tax cuts offered by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and now the Economic Action Plan with big cuts to the two-rate tax system. The Leader of the Opposition is back to the electoral bribe in the first week of office. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Leader of the Opposition says on page 4 that he is willing to tackle the tough decisions. It is a very tough decision to give somebody a tax cut. It is a really tough one. One really has to get one's pecker up, one's guts up, to give someone a tax cut. That is really giving it to them, is it not? But that is what the new leadership is going to offer. It is going to offer these changes; it is going to offer a system which provides more to the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same newspaper the day before the cat was really let out of the bag by the former senator and former Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone, who at least honestly had this to say about a consumption tax:</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is precisely because the consumption tax-cum-income tax cutting proposals are recognised as inegalitarian that all of them include various associated measures for `compensating' those . . . affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA>But listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA> The problem then is that the more perfectly you `compensate' those adversely affected . . . the more egalitarian you render the overall outcome-and, hence, the less you succeed in enhancing national savings. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the more one makes it fair, the less practical and effective it is in lifting savings because one cannot give the biggest tax cuts to the rich. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But if we are to raise our national savings by making after tax incomes more unequal we do not need a consumption tax to do so. We could just take, for example, merely take away the tax-free threshold and cut the top rates. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, here is former Senator Stone saying that one does not even need a consumption tax: do not go through the humbug and cant of setting up a badly compensated consumption tax. Just rip the money off low income earners with the tax-free threshold and give it to the rich. He said, `That is basically what you want to do. If you want to compensate everyone you will end up with an egalitarian outcome and it won't work anyway'. In other words, he has blown the gaff on honourable members opposite in what they are really about with their consumption tax proposal-a non-compensated consumption tax to let the poor have it right in the neck and to give the money up the top to flatten the tax system with a two-rate structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition says that it is too progressive. That is what the Opposition means by selling out and representing the people of Vaucluse, as if the profit share in gross domestic product is not high enough at an Australian record, as if the corporate rate is not low enough at 39 with full dividend imputation. No, belt the poor and give them an even bigger tax cut by having a two-rate or flat rate system which is paid for and then masquerade that as being tough, as addressing the real issues-giving the rich a tax cut. That is what it is really all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the changed agenda. We now have in the House two former advisers to the former Government, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is sitting here as a frontbencher. Where were they when quota protection went up in the middle 1970s, when quotas were introduced and protection actually rose from the tariff cut of the Labor Government of 1974? Where were they when the two-airline agreement was re-entered before this Government was elected to office? Where were they when all of the work practices on the waterfront were being wound into an extricable set of complementary arrangements? Where were they when the structure of fiscal policy-the current Leader of the Opposition was the principal economic adviser-gave us the largest fiscal imbalance of any country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or, as Senator Stone then said in his former capacity as Secretary to the Treasury, the greatest change in fiscal policy, the greatest unwinding of fiscal policy, that had been witnessed?</PARA>
<PARA> Where were they when the former Government gave the States unlimited power to borrow and blow the public sector borrowing requirement out of the water? Are they back there shifting their policy ground? No, they are in to try to give a tax cut to the rich. If Senator Button and I or the Prime Minister exchange some words about degrees of difference over tariffs they are in here with a censure motion, when they presided over the sclerosis of Australian manufacturing with McEwenism, when the Liberal Party sunk under the criminal, craven pressure of the Country Party to provide for this industrial swamp, this sewage, this sink they left Australian manufacturing in-this spittoon they produced in Australian manufacturing. Now, when we talk about reducing protection they are up here on a censure. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is like all the ones before him. He has no new ideas and not much to say and cannot say it very well anyway. That is what today's censure means. What it means is that the Opposition is not going back to do its fundamental work. What this tactic today implies is that Opposition members will sit there doing what they have always done-wait until it falls into their laps. They will wait for a damned long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a shallow defence we have seen from the Government here this afternoon; what a mocking defence, what an arrogant defence the Government has put up. Let me highlight just two of the very cheap shots lodged by the Government in this debate. I remind the House that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) invoked no less a body than the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship in his defence of Senator Tate. I point out to the Prime Minister that we are not doubting the truth of some of Senator Tate's comments. I am going to read them into the lower House Hansard. I quote from the Senate Hansard. At 4 o'clock on the last sitting Thursday after our Question Time had expired, Senator Tate said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In relation to my knowledge of the arrest, I have conceded that I knew of the arrest of certain persons back in January 1989. I find it difficult to give only a partial indication of what was in the brief about the arrest, but I will tell the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA>honourable members should listen to this-</PARA>
<PARA>that I was informed of the names of the two Australians and was informed that two Thais were also arrested. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is on the record that the Minister knew over a year and a quarter before he made his appalling mistake, and to use the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship in this context does the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) no good. It does damage to that organisation from which I hope it will recover, and I point out that the Prime Minister would have been better served addressing the fundamentals of that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did. He went one worse. He decided, as a cheap debating point, to invoke the flood victims in the course of this censure debate. May I remind the House that the very first question I asked on behalf of the coalition in my new role as Federal Leader of the National Party of Australia was a question about the floods. It was addressed to the Treasurer. May I remind the House that that was over five days ago and I am still waiting for an answer from the Treasurer. We gave the matter our absolute priority. May I also remind the House that there is no one worse than this man in answering questions or answering his ministerial correspondence submitted on behalf of electors. It is about time the Treasurer became less arrogant and more answerable to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say that we will push on with the matter of public importance on floods, because we accept the importance of it and that was a very cheap point for which the Treasurer should apologise. I could go on to mention something about his personal persona following his extraordinary visit to the floods-I am pleased he went; let me be quite clear-but I choose not to, because we are about lifting the standards of this debate and addressing the fundamentals. That is why this censure is vital in terms of its taking priority over business at this time and because of that undoubtedly the Government has a case to answer which so far it has failed to answer both in respect of Senator Tate and in respect of Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, in one sense there can be no more important issue than Cabinet solidarity and what has been torn up here today is the question of Cabinet solidarity. In one sense, there comes a time at which every government reaches a turning point. That time for this Government is today. This is a time the Prime Minister has fundamentally walked away from the need to honour Cabinet solidarity and he will pay a price for it. In some ways the genesis of this goes back to another time. Honourable members will remember the day the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) crept round to the office of the Prime Minister, and what did he say to the Prime Minister, in his third term? He said, `Bob, it is about time you resigned; it is about time you retired'. </PARA>
<PARA> What happened after that? None other than the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) was around there saying, `Bob, it is about time you named the date'. There was the headline in the Sydney Morning Herald and elsewhere, `Button says, ``Hawke, name the date'' '-not at the next election-`name the date of your retirement, Prime Minister, during the next parliamentary term'. </PARA>
<PARA> What did the Prime Minister do in those circumstances arising? Nothing. He allowed two senior Ministers to come and ask for his resignation, and then he let them off the hook. I think we all know what a Margaret Thatcher would do in that situation. We all know what happened to Heseltine. We all know what a Lange would do in that situation. We all know what happened to Douglas, for example. Let me say very clearly in the House that in fact the Prime Minister failed the test at the time of Senator Button's and Mr Dawkins's intervention, when they asked for his resignation, and the Prime Minister has failed the test on this occasion by failing to take proper action with regard to Senator Button, with regard to the Treasurer and with regard to Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, it is interesting to examine some of the quotes from no less a person than the Treasurer. He said in 1980, reported again on 18 October 1985, the following:</PARA>
<PARA>The first Labor leader I tear down will be the one I replace. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that the agenda of the Treasurer today? Is that what he is about? Is that the secret agenda? Did he hold a press conference at 10 o'clock this morning to commence this process of tearing down the Prime Minister? Because there it is-that is his statement. It is an exact quote. On 24 May 1988, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>I would probably run the place in a different way than Bob runs it. I would run it differently from the way he does. </PARA>
<PARA>Another quote, more dynamic to the Caucus, relates to 1981 when he said that if the Caucus dared to pass him over in terms of the Prime Ministership `they will pass me over at their own political folly'. I can see the Left smiling at that. I thank the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and others for these contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> The best of the lot comes from 1986 when the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>I could do a lot more outside politics. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Treasurer, `Away you go. We give you the invitation', because the Deputy Prime Minister has outlasted his distance in politics. It is time that he departed and went outside politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also guilty of another smokescreen with regard to these matters before the House this day. This matter came up during the election campaign. The Left got all excited for a moment and thought it was going to get a deal out of the Right. Do honourable members recall the time when the Minister for Community Services and Health, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), was suddenly elevated in the media, in the middle of the campaign, to the position of being the likely Deputy Prime Minister candidate after the election if the Government won? Faces lit up on the Left. It thought the Right had finally seen a way to be magnanimous, to be fair once and for all and give the Left a fair dinkum go for once. What happened? Within 24 hours of the election that deal had been torn up. The Treasurer came back into the stakes for Deputy Prime Minister and, of course, the poor old Minister for Community Services and Health was sent packing into the sunset. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has a lot to answer for in terms of the economic agony he has created all over Australia. He has a lot to answer for in terms of his conduct in the parliamentary building this morning when he broke every rule of Cabinet solidarity and attacked his most senior colleague, Senator Button. The Prime Minister has even more to answer for in not standing up to the Deputy Prime Minister sitting on his left wing and dismissing him, and, in sorting it out, dismissing Senator Button and, for that matter, Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at Senator Button and his record over the years. This is not the first time that he has been involved in a series of altercations and spates with the Treasurer. It is not the first time that he has stated his own agenda. Indeed, it is very clear that this is a Cabinet running around in a candy shop in all directions-babes in a candy shop trying to pick up sweets here and there, and heading off in every direction while the country's economy goes down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has breached solidarity on occasions as well. He has certainly got a reputation for speaking honestly about the economy, as did his former ministerial colleague Senator Walsh. Clearly the Prime Minister, in accordance with the censure motion so ably moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), has consistently failed to exercise leadership to avoid these conflicting statements and ensure that he has a united Cabinet-one which adheres to the important Westminster doctrine of Cabinet solidarity. The Prime Minister's failure to do that is a charge before the House at this time. That is what the House is addressing-the failure to discipline Keating, Button and Senator Tate and, indeed, move for their dismissal. That is the case the Prime Minister must now answer. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us come back to that third case, the case of Senator Tate. Let me tell the House that my colleagues have adequately shown that Senator Tate is no legal babe in the woods. He is a former dean of law at the University of Tasmania. How can he have the hide to stand up and say that, despite the error, he should be allowed to continue as Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs in Australia? How can he honestly do that, when the person was charged and the Minister for Justice  decided to assign guilt?</PARA>
<PARA> Going one step further, I submit to the House that Senator Tate also has a very deep knowledge of the drug trade between Australia and Thailand, quite legitimately in his role as Minister with responsibilities for the work of the Australian Federal Police, and with the visit that he made in March 1988, at which time he had a series of briefings which I, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), and others had the privilege of having also. The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs met the Secretary-General of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Major-General Chauvolit Yodmani. </PARA>
<PARA> He met a number of other officials. He looked at the ONCB computer project, which Australia is part-funding. It is an important project and a good one. It tracks the movements of people between Australia and Thailand, and elsewhere, and has helped greatly in apprehending the drug traffickers in this part of the world. Every one of those briefings always emphasises the point that the linkage between various drug traffickers is complex; that there is a lot of networking, that there are a number of Mr Bigs and many of the cases are interrelated, and that in those circumstances one should always exercise a great deal of caution. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that Senator Tate has failed on two counts. The first is, as Minister for Justice, assuming guilt when someone is charged. That is unacceptable. Secondly, he knows the whole background of the drug trafficking industry between Australia and Thailand and should therefore have been cautious in his comments. But no, he got so exited that he boiled over. The result is a mistrial in New South Wales resulting in a great deal of additional cost and difficulty, and the failure of the Prime Minister to act in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other area which is relevant to this whole situation. I could give examples of Minister after Minister having failed to adhere to Cabinet solidarity. The Prime Minister has failed to make them adhere to solidarity. Following today's efforts in being prepared to tolerate a much lower standard of acceptable behaviour, things will get worse and will continue to do so. If Treasurer Keating gets away with this today one can bet that he will be back again saying more things about ministerial colleagues in an unacceptable way. That is why the Prime Minister needed to act today, but in not doing so he has failed the House and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the prospect of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) not even knowing about the confidentiality of his own departmental files, as they were scattered all over the Canberra Press Gallery by the ex-Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, who got busy with a photocopier and copied all the files and then took off into the sunset. Is that the basis on which the Prime Minister allows government to be conducted in this country? The Prime Minister should re-read the censure motion and accept the thrust of it. He has failed his Government and his country in his failure to act against these Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) in action last week and we have now seen the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-and nothing is clearer than that, during this Parliament, changes will be made. Those of us who have sat in this Parliament for a while can imagine what the conduct of this debate would have been like had former leaders, such as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), been presenting the Opposition case. We would not have been savaged by a sort of wet lettuce; we would have been savaged by someone who had at least some understanding of parliamentary processes. None of that has come through at all on the part of those speaking here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of aside, let me make something clear about one thing-because I think the Opposition's tactics stand condemned in this regard. What the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said about the normal course of events with matters of public importance is absolutely right. When a censure motion is moved in this place-and this is not simply the tradition of this Government but has been the tradition of previous governments-the matter of public importance goes out the window. That has been the normal course of events, in order to ensure that Government business and other business of the day gets done. </PARA>
<PARA> So, putting forward that motion as a blind was done in full knowledge of that. Nothing could be more cynical than trying to exploit in that way the position of those who have been involved in the task of clearing up those floods and the flood victims. </PARA>
<PARA> On this occasion we will depart from normal practice and permit the matter of public importance to take place. Because of that we will not compound the chicanery of the other side of the House and use such matters in this way. No doubt, any of those people who bother to follow this debate will know the motives of the Opposition as far as these matters are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made no case here today. The reason why the motion is before us is that the Leader of the Opposition suffered a buffeting from his colleagues during the course of last week as to how he was handling at that stage the situation of Senator Tate. It is quite evident from the comments that the Leader of the Opposition made on Friday to members of the Press Gallery, or which he allowed his office to make, that he intended not to pursue the Senator Tate matter any further. He accepted that, on balance, as far as the Prime Minister was concerned, the public interest was served more effectively by Senator Tate remaining in his office, this imbroglio being taken out of the newspapers so that trials could proceed without interference by public comment. That was the statesmanlike position he adopted then. </PARA>
<PARA> That, of course, was not the position that his colleagues wished him to adopt. What his colleagues wanted him to do was to go for blood. They said to him, `If you fail to do that, you fail a test as Leader of the Opposition'. When this was finally pointed out to the honourable member, after having maintained his silence through a couple of days of potential parliamentary consideration of it, having allowed that to go forward, he said, `Oh, no, I am not in fact a weak Leader of the Opposition. I will in fact say something about this when the time comes. Unlike the sensible position that I adopted in relation to the media, I will turn that on its head and I will ensure, by my comments in this place or those that I permit my colleagues to make, that whatever trial is about to take place would be delayed further'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the position of the Opposition Leader-a position of falling between two stools. There are pressures to make him, in the minds of some of his colleagues, an effective Opposition Leader as opposed to the commonsense that he has when he moves outside the economic area and starts making the judgment of a plain man as to what is a sensible course of action. The commonsense that caused him to decide to do nothing further has been set aside. That is a very great shame for this country but, nevertheless, it is worth noting on this side of the House when we consider how these things are going to be dealt with in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> All that needs to be said about Senator Tate is this: Obviously there was an on balance judgment made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) as to whether or not Senator Tate should remain in office. Two important things had to be weighed in the balance in respect of Senator Tate remaining in office. The first was that Senator Tate's contribution to law enforcement in this country has been substantial since he has held his post. The essence of that, in fact, was ironically outlined by the Leader of the National Party of Australia when he spoke here about the sincerity of Senator Tate's commitment in the drug war and the effectiveness of his administration's efforts, in so far as Federal government can be effective in that regard, to pursue this objective. That was one thing that weighed in the balance and ought to weigh in the balance. Indeed, that matter was not in doubt in respect of those senators who censured him. I am sure that Senator Hill and Senator Macklin, who have worked with the Minister, have absolutely no doubt as to his contribution to the fight against crime. </PARA>
<PARA> That weighed in the balance in the favour of Senator Tate. What also weighed in the balance in favour of Senator Tate is that everybody has accepted the veracity of his account, and that is that he was not aware that a trial was proceeding in this country when he made the comments that he did. </PARA>
<PARA> The long established practice of ministerial responsibility is that when Ministers are sacked and held accountable for their actions it is because they have knowingly adopted a position in regard to the administration of their portfolio where they have caused the objectives of that portfolio to be seriously upset or where they have corrupted the objectives of that portfolio. That is why Ministers are sacked. They are not sacked for mistakes. They are sacked for intentional actions aimed at destroying an important aspect of government policy with regard to their portfolio or, for that matter, any other, or behaving in regard to their portfolio or any other aspect of government activity in a corrupt fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> None of those issues has been raised in the case of Senator Tate. There is an on balance question of trading off whether or not he had seriously harmed his effectiveness as a Minister for Justice so seriously that he could no longer continue in office with whether or not his very substantial contribution and the inadvertence of the comments he made were reason enough to leave him in his position. In that on balance decision, the decision of the Prime Minister fell on the side of maintaining Senator Tate in office. That is all there is to it; it is not a terribly complex matter. </PARA>
<PARA> And there the matter ought to be let rest, as Hewson mark 1 on Thursday morning would have it rest. Hewson mark 2, stiffened up by less cool heads on the Opposition front bench, took a totally different view the next day. But we in this House are fortunately not in a position where we have to accommodate this sort of nonsense. We can accept Hewson mark 1 and leave the matter at that as far as this aspect of the censure motion is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The censure motion goes on to discuss questions related to the Government's handling of economic policy. I ask: With a record like the Opposition's during the course of the last election campaign and with a record like the Opposition's since that campaign, what any right thinking person making a judgment about what this Parliament ought to be considering now is whether or not the Opposition's views on economic matters stack up against those of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have had from the Opposition since the election is total confusion. We have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, who is the Opposition's policy bungee jumper. What the Opposition does with the Deputy Opposition Leader is tie a rope around his ankles. Then it throws him off a cliff. The screaming noise that he makes when he goes down is called `floating a policy'. And the `boing' which is heard when he reaches the bottom and starts bouncing up again is the policy being reconsidered. The snap that we ultimately hear is when the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) or someone else whacks an axe into that rope and he goes all the way down. He will be no loss when he goes down all that way. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me tell the honourable member that at the rate the Liberal Party makes policy changes, it will finally arrive at a conclusion on the consumption tax probably at that time honoured point when the general spills of Liberal leadership take place-about 18 months from now. About 18 months from now the Liberal Party will bell the cat on Liberal Party leadership change as the honourable member for O'Connor or somebody else snaps that rope. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition repeated here again today-otherwise I would not have bothered raising it in the course of this debate-the suggestion that somehow or other the action last week of the Treasurer in choosing to use the National Press Club instead of this place to continue to maintain an argument for well established Government policy was somehow reprehensible. I would not have bothered bringing that up again because I thought the Opposition had got off it. But I see that has to be, or evidently is, one of the Opposition's arguments that suggests somehow the inability of this Government to declare and promote a coherent and consistent economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes this chamber takes on an Alice in Wonderland atmosphere and no more Alice in Wonderland atmosphere can be conjured up by this. Here we have the Government doing what? It is declaring and promoting a coherent and consistent economic policy. We have announced that policy to the electorate. We announced to the electorate that there would be no consumption tax because we have broadened the tax base. We did so because of the essential inequities in it, because of its impact on inflation and because of all the other things that the Treasurer talked about in the course of his remarks which, while elaborate in detail, were essentially no different from arguments that the Treasurer was presenting before the election-arguments which had sound economic reasons behind them. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Treasurer did that last Wednesday, we are now to be censured here today for not being coherent and consistent. On the other hand, these fellows who wrap themselves in unctuous statements about how they are now giving serious thought to the nature of the economy are capable of marching out to the electorate and saying things about three or four weeks before the election. </PARA>
<PARA> On an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program on 12 March 1990 the then Opposition Treasury spokesman, the honourable member for Wentworth, said:</PARA>
<PARA> And we decided not to have a new broad-based consumption tax in our first term for two main reasons. One, we want to cut Government expenditure and we want the focus to be on cutting Government expenditure. And you don't, you know, to be crude, want to give a new Government a new tax, as was the case in New Zealand where a significant percentage of the revenue from the tax was actually spent by the Government or in the case of the United Kingdom even, Thatcher doubled the VAT in the early eighties and spent a substantial amount of the gain on boosting social security and health expenditure. We want to focus our attention on expenditure restraint. Secondly, there is already a very wide range of consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not actually sound to me like an ill-considered statement. It sounds like a statement of a thought out political position that he was attempting to establish in order to give the Liberal Party's policy something it had not had before; that is, coherence and consistency. He made that statement only two months ago. Yet he comes in here and says that we are incoherent and inconsistent because we still agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have presented to us is an Opposition which wants to have a sea change as far as that consumption tax is concerned. It then comes to us and says, `Look, what we want you to do is to break your promises in order to establish your credibility with the electorate'. I thank the Opposition very much for that advice. We are not going to be taking that advice because as far as we can see that is not a sensible way of going about business. </PARA>
<PARA> In suggesting that we have to be censured for an inability to declare and promote a coherent and consistent economic policy instead of the Opposition is simply humbug. This whole censure motion is humbug from beginning to end. It is conceived in failure, failure from the point of view of an opposition to handle the issues related to Senator Tate sensibly last week, having chosen to go the high road instead of the low road, to try to backtrack on that and scramble down the incline to find the low road again. That is the first error of judgment as far as the Opposition is concerned about this matter. The second is that it made some sort of broad based attack on the Government about its economic policy when it has no coherent alternative to offer and when it cannot sustain any case against the Government at all of the type that it has indicated in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The censure motion is a motion that has become much abused in this place over the years. It was once a motion that was treated seriously by governments. It is treated seriously no longer by government, either here or in the Senate. Every one of us on the front bench has had the experience of being censured in the Senate, including me. I found out about it when Senator Hamer told me two weeks after the event. Censure motions are a dime a dozen in the Senate. They are not treated seriously there and if they are going to have a similar background here they will not be treated seriously here either. It is time for us to vote on this motion. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the question be now put. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA> Original question put:</PARA>
<PARA> That the motion (Dr Hewson's) be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a statement on the tabling of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) report on road use charges and vehicle registration, which is a national scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very pleased today to release the Inter-State Commission report on road user charging and vehicle registration. As this was its final report, the Commission took the opportunity to broaden its investigation and finalise its work on an earlier efficiency reference. It is therefore a comprehensive analysis of most of the key roads and road transport issues confronting governments today. The Commission's work on transport is highly regarded and I would like to thank the Commissioners and staff for their commitment since 1984 on behalf of the Government. They have made a substantial contribution to improving Australia's transport system. On a personal note I have found their objective assessments of transport issues of great assistance in developing land transport policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Its proposals on vehicle registration, cost recovery and road funding are far-reaching and worthy of careful study and thoughtful discussion. I propose therefore, that there be an eight week public comment period to allow for a wide range of contributions, after which the Government will formulate its proposals in consultation with the States and industry. The report raises issues central to the Government's approach to land transport reform in its fourth term of office. This approach focuses on Australia's transport needs:</PARA>
<PARA>* a more balanced and integrated system with stronger links between road, rail and sea and a more efficient interface, particularly at the waterfront</PARA>
<PARA>* a rail system capable of competing effectively in the freight and passenger markets</PARA>
<PARA>* urban public transport systems which meet the legitimate requirements of users, at a time when the road systems in our major cities are becoming increasingly congested and the effects of transport activity on the environment more serious</PARA>
<PARA>* reduction of the additional taxation burden imposed by inefficient public enterprises: rail deficits on commercial services have no place in an efficient economy and transport system. Services provided for social reasons should be clearly identified as community service obligations with more stringent controls on operating subsidies</PARA>
<PARA>* reduction of the high cost of road trauma by a range of measures including a model shift to more commercial rail systems, improved road networks and vehicles, and a more socially responsible approach from all road users to safety</PARA>
<PARA>* a better return on the community's major investments in land transport infrastructure-we cannot afford a second rate return on this investment, or be wasteful in using it. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of major studies in recent years have highlighted the deficiencies in our transport systems and the enormous potential benefits from significant reform. The Industry Commission (IC) in its last annual report conservatively estimated a 3 per cent increase in Australian gross domestic product from transport reform. This is roughly equivalent to the annual growth from all sectors of the economy at present. Land transport accounts for most of these benefits, with the Industries Assistance Commission's estimates based on improved road pricing and rail reform alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The Business Council of Australia has estimated savings in excess of $500m from more rational road transport arrangements such as higher mass limits, B-Doubles operating nationally, deregulation of commodity transport and improved road transport administration. While there is room for debate about some of the claims made in these studies there is little doubt that many of their criticisms are justified. Australia is not in a position to ignore this potential for economic growth, particularly when the means of achieving it will also have environmental benefits and significantly reduce pressure on public budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the Hawke Government has changed our land transport system significantly: we have undertaken a comprehensive examination of the road transport industry, and in 1987 became directly involved through the Federal interstate registration scheme. This has provided a means for increasing uniformity of regulations, increasing productivity and addressing the most serious charging anomalies; our new road funding arrangements have made progress in requiring greater efficiency in the management of our road networks and in targeting our limited investment to roads of economic significance; and the federally owned railway, Australian National, has vastly improved its performance on commercial traffics and now records a surplus on mainland commercial freight operations. We have also increased pressure on the States to follow this lead with their own systems through the Grants Commission. More change is now required to meet the increasing demands on our transport system. Greater and continuing commitment to change is required from all levels of government and the transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The guiding objectives for the Federal Government can be simply described as promoting development of an integrated, efficient and coordinated land transport system which reflects national economic and social priorities; pursues safe and efficient operations and practices responsive to user requirements, with each mode undertaking the transport tasks to which it is best suited; and is equipped to meet the rapid growth envisaged for the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA> In continuing to pursue these objectives we will be observing the following principles: national funds will be targeted to projects with a high economic and social benefit; increased competition within and between transport modes-the primary role for governments is to provide the environment in which this competition can take place; freight and passenger transport regulation should be limited to that required to meet legitimate community expectations, particularly in relation to safety; more economic pricing arrangements for publicly provided road and rail infrastructure are required, with greater involvement by the private sector in the provision of that infrastructure, and in the operations of our rail systems; the States need to be more responsive to economic, market and commercial imperatives in their investment decisions; and our initial approach will be to seek a cooperative basis for reform with the States, but we will make strategic use of Federal powers, which are considerable, where this process does not yield a satisfactory rate or level of change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government recognises that land transport reform is a process which needs to be accelerated. The opportunities presented by rapid growth will be grasped only if fundamental changes are made over the next few years. On this basis we are planning a series of reforms in  1990-91 as part of a comprehensive package for land transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's report will be of great assistance in this regard. It has identified the key areas to be addressed in road transport and in the provision and management of our road system. The ISC report suggests that roads and road transport are important areas for micro-economic reform and the existing mechanisms for achieving these reforms have not succeeded in producing the necessary changes fast enough; greater efficiency and public accountability is required from our road authorities; there is an urgent need for a more national approach to road transport; existing road user charging arrangements are neither efficient nor equitable; there are large differences between individual State road user charges, encouraging operators to `shop around', penalising those States attempting to develop responsible road user charges; and there are many opportunities for increased productivity through more innovative use of our road system. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the next two months I will be consulting with my State colleagues, road users and the road transport industry on the ISC proposals for resolving these problems. I will also be talking to transport unions and authorities about solutions to the deficiencies in our land transport system generally. At this stage I envisage a meeting with my State colleagues in the Australian Transport Advisory Council in August to consider the results of these discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I anticipate a positive approach from all parties to the reforms necessary for land transport to meet the great demands that will be placed upon it in the 1990s. The progress in recent years has established the framework in which the necessary reforms can be implemented. But I think we all agree that the pace of change now needs to be greatly increased. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am pleased to be able to respond to the Government's first major report this term addressing what is, after all, a fundamental area, namely, micro-economic reform. I thank the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) for his cooperation in allowing me to see the report prior to its being tabled although, judging by the reports appearing in the press in the last couple of weeks, it seems that I was not the first to get a copy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Inter-State Commission report that has been tabled this afternoon has had a long and tortured history. Indeed, it reflects the long and tortured history that the Government's micro-economic reform has had to date. It would be salient for me to run through the last seven years in the lead-up to the tabling of this report. In fact, this is the latest-and regrettably the last-effort from the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> During the February 1983 election the Australian Labor Party promised to conduct a national inquiry into the road freight industry in consultation with State and Territory governments and industry organisations. The May National Road Freight Industry Inquiry reported in September 1984. Following that, legislation was pledged in March 1985-another six months later-to establish Federal registration and licensing of vehicles and to set up the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC). That was more than two years after the first promise in February 1983. Through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Government said it would take up with the States the question of uniformity of driver licensing, uniformity of speed limits, uniformity of policies to improve rail cost recovery and uniformity of extension of consumer protection to trucking. All of that was promised some years ago. To date very little has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1985, the Interstate Road Transport Bill came into the Parliament but its effects were delayed until January 1987. We are now four years down the track. In the meantime, in April 1986 the Inter-State Commission brought in a report on cost recovery for registration charges. Following that report, four years ago, there was another report in October 1987, again looking at interstate road and registration charges. That second report was followed by the July 1988 truck blockade. Again, we had another deferral of the interstate charges until January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has now tabled what is effectively the third report of the Inter-State Commission, which we are looking at today. In 1986 the first report was tabled; the third one has now been tabled. The point I make is that that is an awfully long time to keep tabling reports with very little action. The report suggests that it is not intended that anything be implemented until 1 July 1992. That would be almost 10 years since that first election promise in 1983 to conduct an inquiry and presumably to act. When we talk about speed of micro-economic reform, I think nearly 10 years is far from satisfactory and far from impressive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's five-page speech this afternoon had some difficulty in scratching together what the real achievements of the Government have been over the last seven years, rather than the reports that have been produced. If we look at the actual achievements, it certainly has undertaken a comprehensive examination of the road transport industry. In fact, there has been several of these examinations. The Government talks about its new road funding arrangements. During the last election campaign it was pretty obvious from the reaction out amongst the public that the level of road funding has been far from adequate over the last few years, and there is a strong push amongst road users to see that level of funding increased. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned improving the efficiency of Australian National Railways, and I certainly support that view. I think it is most commendable. The fact is that all the Government had to do, and in fact all the Government really did do, was to pick up a piece of lapsed legislation that the Fraser Government had introduced in 1982, resubmit it to the Parliament-the Minister is smirking; he knows it is true-and push it through. Of course, it was very good legislation because it was prepared before the Government even had to think about it. So after seven years one has to say that the Government's record of reform is really seven years of mostly lost opportunity. It is a real disappointment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister alluded in his speech, and we are all familiar with it, to the joint submission put forward by the Industry Commission and the Business Council of Australia, which mentioned that the transport industry could make very significant increases in national output. In fact, the report suggested that in the real area it could be of the order of $2.4 billion; in roads, $1.7 billion; and in the bulk commodity handling area, another $2 billion. These are very large figures and they would make a very significant improvement in our gross national product. They also highlight the fact that there should have been action some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess what one is getting to is that the coalition would now like to see some action from the Government. We have had seven years of lost opportunities. Now we have another report, the third one in this area, following on some earlier work by the May National Road Freight Industry inquiry. It is time to see some action. If the Government is prepared to come forward with constructive and sensible proposals, I can assure the Minister that the Opposition will support those moves. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are really saying is, `Please, do something'. Obviously micro-economic reform should mean more than just producing report after report. For example, I think an obvious case is put forward here and in other places for more private funding and participation in road building and road maintenance and operation. Nowadays, Australian superannuation funds are awash with funds and are looking for long term investments. Obviously, road building and operation would be a suitable area for that type of long term funding. I have heard it said by someone who has some knowledge in this area that this would be a means of perhaps doubling the amount of money going into road construction in Australia right now. I suggest that the Government ought to give it some consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to say that it is disappointing to see that the Inter-State Commission is being scrapped. I think we have lost a very valuable body. While it may be said that it is being incorporated into the Industry Commission, I doubt that we will see the same type of work being done as was done by this separate body, which was committed to looking at these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to commend the work of those who produced this report, and I allude also to the problem of the Inter-State Commission being scrapped. I point out that in the executive summary there is a very interesting comment on this. The Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA>It would have preferred to present preliminary findings and then to hold a further round of hearings before formulating its final recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>However, this course of action was somewhat inhibited by the Commission's abolition. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a lovely turn of phrase. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to say that unfortunately all the effort that has gone into this and many other reports is really not reflected in the emphasis this Government has placed to date on micro-economic reform. I put the Government on notice that we will be watching very closely to see the progress of all the great statements that are being made at the present moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall be very short. We welcome the statement by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). I too regret that it is the last of the investigations by the Inter-State Commission. There is an urgency about it, and the urgency simply is that the economy of Australia today demands that something extra be done so far as out transport systems are concerned. I have mentioned before in the House that, of all the commodities we buy off the shelf, between 12 and 15 per cent of the cost is the cost of transport. So the infrastructure generally of all our passenger and freight transport throughout Australia is very important indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to the statements by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) on a number of occasions about the state of train travel in Australia. Because of the safety aspect and the cost of freight generally, I think it is time we looked very seriously at the integration of all our means of transport. It is for that reason that I welcome the statement the Minister has presented to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The condition of our roads is a major issue that must be tackled by the Government. Once again, I personally appeal on behalf of the Opposition to the Government to make available as much funding as possible from the petrol tax to enable our highways and the national arterial roads to be improved. I welcome the announcement today by the Federal Minister and the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Mr Baird, of $20m a year extra from both the Federal and the State governments for the Pacific Highway. I welcome the fact that they are talking together, which I think is very important. In practical terms they have made an allocation that will mean that over the next 10 years at least $1 billion will be spent on the Pacific Highway. It is a major arterial road for freight, and it is important not only for those areas up the coast but also for Australia generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the statement and support the Ministers, and naturally I ask that the report receive consideration in the months ahead. As the Minister has outlined, we need the integration of our sea, water, rail, and road transport. This is very important indeed in a country such as Australia. As I said earlier, it affects the economy of the country. I do not really know the meanings of micro-economic and macro-economic, a lot of people take a guess on these things. But I recognise a country that has serious economic problems. We must identify in turn those issues that will help this country back on its feet. The Minister has mentioned today some of the issues related to transport that I believe are very pertinent. That is why I welcome the statement. I ask that greater thought be given generally now that the pressure is on. All Australians recognise how important it is to get the infrastructure working. I ask the Government to give as much attention as possible over the months ahead to overcoming our transport problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all I wish to thank the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) for accepting this matter of public importance following the censure debate early this afternoon. I believe that it indicates the spirit that exists on both sides of the House in relation to the floods, and that is the spirit in which I have put forward this debate today on behalf of the Opposition parties. Uncommonly for matters of public importance, this matter of public importance does not criticise the Government, whether it is the Federal Government or one or all of the three State governments which are involved with the great flood problems we have in the three eastern States and which are continuing as the floods move down the Darling system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These floods, that occurred in late April and, as I said, that are continuing in certain areas, have been very significant both in respect of the area covered and of the degree of devastation. One can argue whether they are the greatest floods this country has had, but whether they are or are not I do not think it matters. They are very significant. They cover an area of over one million square kilometres, or greater than the combined area of Britain, France and Germany. They have been particularly devastating in three widely separated geographic areas: central Queensland, north-western New South Wales and East Gippsland. Fortunately, very few people lost their lives. I extend the sympathy of everyone here to the families of those who are grieving. I also commend the expertise that meant that so few did lose their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic loss from these floods is still mounting. According to my calculation, at the moment it could be approaching about $200m. At least half a million sheep have been lost, with more to be lost. My colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) will go into that in more detail. About 20,000 head of cattle have been lost, as has about $50m of the very important cotton crop in New South Wales alone. But the greatest costs coming up are the infrastructure costs: the roads, the railways, the hospitals, the levy banks and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again on behalf of everyone here I congratulate the Defence Force personnel, the police, the State Emergency Service people in each of the three States and the hordes of volunteers of all types who so readily assisted and who still are assisting. For example, at present in Nyngan volunteers from the Bush Fire Brigade have just had a rotation as they assist with the hosing down and cleaning out of houses, et cetera. Then there are the other types of volunteers, those in the Dubbo area and other relief centre areas who have been looking after the displaced families. </PARA>
<PARA> I also commend the courage of those isolated farm families. Flying over some of those areas a couple of weeks ago with the honourable member for Parkes and Senator Brownhill from New South Wales I saw these homesteads with the levy banks surrounded by a massive inland sea. These people have had to show tremendous courage to maintain not only their livelihoods but also their sanity. I also commend the residents of those particularly hard-hit communities such as Charleville, Nyngan, Boisdale and of the other smaller communities which have been either partly or wholly evacuated. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers the flood situation, immediately one is reminded of the short period in our recorded history of rainfall records and records of river heights and flood heights. Nyngan, in particular, is a stark reminder of this and of the perverse nature of our continent. At the same time we have drought areas still declared elsewhere in Australia. We have already had bushfires and earthquakes earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, in the aftermath of the floods, with residents returning to those communities, questions need to be asked in a positive way to ensure that assistance is being maximised and that we learn for the future, whatever government is in power at the Federal or State levels. For example, how appropriate are the Federal-State arrangements? Are each of the three States involved maximising the different forms of assistance? Have they communicated to the affected people what those people are entitled to? I will return to this later. </PARA>
<PARA> How good are the State Emergency Service operations in each of the States? I know that is largely a matter for the States but it does have Federal ramifications because it is the Federal Government that decides whether or not to call in the defence forces. It has other ramifications with regard to the Federal-State financial cost sharing arrangements, depending on what decisions are made and the payment of Federal benefits, depending on what decisions are made. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, how good is our early warning system for floods, our river gauging, our rain intensity arrangements? Are those gauging systems still adequate? Should they be modern, remote accessed radio controlled type gauges, so that if a river is in flood somebody can learn that it is, and that the Nyngans, the Charlevilles or whatever can be given better and more accurate warning as to what the level and intensity of the flood will be? That is both a Federal and a State responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> How effective is the equipment for disaster relief assistance? One thinks at a Federal level in relation to aircraft. Once again I commend the Defence Force personnel who have been operating those aircraft now for some weeks and who still are, in the fodder drops as the floods move down the Darling. They have had the role, for example, of evacuating and assisting with two communities. We have the Caribou and the Hercules for fodder drops and for flying in supplies to isolated areas. How cost-effective are they? The reports coming through to me are that the Hercules has been a far more cost-effective type of aircraft than the Caribou, but obviously the Caribou can operate in some situations where the Hercules cannot. The comment that keeps coming back is that, as opposed to earlier situations when the Chinook heavy lift helicopter was available, it is sorely missed for short range evacuation purposes, for assistance with fighter drops or for assistance with livestock in short range situations. I was encouraged by the response of Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, in the Senate on Thursday to a question from Senator Bjelke-Petersen in relation to consideration by the Government of retaining some Chinook helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> Some communities were completely devastated: Charleville, Nyngan and one or two smaller communities. Are there special needs for those communities, to make sure through, perhaps, additional forms of assistance that they have a viable future? They are facing a very grim situation, either of a personal business nature or just in regard to their future as a community generally. We recognise that they are smaller than Darwin or Newcastle but they should not be ignored, as they have to emerge again from that devastation. </PARA>
<PARA> A specific Federal issue put to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) last week-as was indicated in the debate earlier this afternoon, we are still awaiting a reply-concerns the question of provisional tax, which is all-important for those farmers who have already paid their tax on the basis of what was going to be a considerably higher income than what is now the case. It is very important to enable a rebate of that provisional tax already paid in line with their projected income. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Federal-State arrangements the States negotiate with the Commonwealth within overall parameters. When one looks, for example, at the personal assistance levels, there is quite a difference between the three States in how they are operating at the present time, in the level of that assistance, how much of it is means tested and how much is not means tested. This obviously is mainly a responsibility for the State to sort out. But if, for example, one were a Victorian in East Gippsland, and one's house was submerged or subjected to severe flooding, in theory at least one is entitled to receive up to about $11,000 of assistance in one way or another, without a means test. But a person similarly affected in New South Wales or Queensland is only allowed up to $3,000 before a means test. There is a dramatic difference there and I believe those things need to be highlighted. Also we need to ask whether or not those limits are adequate, taking into account the cost of building and so forth these days, and there are a number of other areas where there are quite significant differences between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members have to acknowledge that with housing in flood-prone areas it is not easy to obtain flood insurance, in the sense that ordinary insurance does not cover floods. In other words, if the flood comes from above with heavy rain on one's place, one is covered, but if the water comes through the fence because of a flood from the river, one is not covered. People living in flood-prone areas have to pay very much heavier premiums for cover and it is therefore a difficult decision to make. </PARA>
<PARA> With businesses there is an $80,000 loan available at six per cent, although once again in two States it does appear possible to obtain more than the $80,000. Again one asks why the differences between the States? But the real problem about the loans for all these businesses-whether they are in the towns or in the farms-is that generally they are already heavily indebted and are paying 20 per cent interest. Just to offer them another loan on which more interest is payable is not necessarily going to be a great help to them, having in mind their ability to repay it, considering their circumstances, and particularly if that loan is available to them only as a last resort. It would seem to me that a loan at 6 per cent would allow someone at least to reduce part of his existing loan on which he is paying 20 per cent and that should be allowed because it would provide some assistance for a business that does not have very bright prospects in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point is payment of welfare. I do want to commend the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) for the action he took to assist people in the Charleville area. We have been advised that 700 people in that area are now receiving special benefit, which of course is the form of benefit when other forms of benefit do not really apply and this was the way to get some cash into the hands of affected ordinary people. But while 700 people at Charleville receive special benefit, only 200 at Nyngan have, and I think we have to ask why. While commending the honourable member for Bowman-and I do not back off from that at all because he did, as I understand it, initiate some quick action by the departmental people-I ask: Was there some breakdown within the Department either in the urgency of getting departmental people to the Nyngan area-meaning Dubbo where the people had moved to-or in the criteria for eligibility for that special benefit? That is another matter that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The major cost eventually will be for infrastructure and that comes into the Federal-State arrangements. We are looking not just at roads, railways, hospitals and libraries but at levee banks. I am told that Nyngan alone will need about 10 kilometres of rebuilt levee banks. Probably 50 kilometres might be a reasonable guesstimate at the moment of rebuilding and strengthening levee banks all round. There has to be a clear statement that that rebuilding is included in the Federal-State arrangements, and as we are rapidly coming to 1 July and most of the bills for the floods will come in after that date, the financial year will commence again for the base amount of $33m for New South Wales, $24m for Victoria and $16m for Queensland. The Federal Government, under the present arrangements, may not be required to bear the fair burden that comes with these major natural disasters. Is that the most appropriate cost distribution, between the Federal and State governments with the financial year arrangements that we have at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with a couple of points concerning farming people. I have mentioned provisional tax and the need for an answer from the Treasurer, both on extending the time for those who have not paid and allowing a rebate to those who have. Another difference between the States is that one State allows up to $1,800 a mile to assist with the rebuilding of boundary fencing, but the other States do not. I think that has to be addressed. Another matter is household support, which does not come through the Department of Social Security but is the only way in which a farmer can get any sort of cash flow assistance when he has no income coming in. It is Federal money but it is done through the State rural adjustment arrangements. There needs to be a sympathetic consideration and implementation of household support, directed down from the Commonwealth, to ensure that those farmers do get some carry-on assistance. We should not forget the flood situation just because the floods have moved downstream. We need to continue to check in the aftermath the adequacy of those arrangements and if they prove not to be adequate we need to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to take part in a debate in which, by and large, the sentiments on both side of the House are as one. It is a pleasure to join with the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) in conveying the sympathy, not just of members on his side of the House but of members on the Government side of the House as well, to those who have suffered distress in the tragic floods that have afflicted Queensland, New South Wales and areas of Victoria and also to echo the honourable member's admiration for the courage that people have displayed. This was displayed not just as they sought to fight the floods-I have in mind the pictures of people in Nyngan as they worked to build up the levees, only to be finally heartbreakingly defeated-but their courage as they have tried to rebuild in the wake of the floods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an extraordinary country we live in-a country of great extremes. In my State-and I see the new honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) sitting opposite on the front bench-we face also the scourge of bushfires, another great natural disaster that we have to deal with in this country, particularly in South Australia and Victoria. I think we have come to expect from those men and women for whom I have particular responsibility in this Government-namely, the Australian Defence Force-that they respond quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of fuss, often in a way that is unsung. This is common ground. I particularly welcome the remarks that the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Lloyd) has made about the work that was done by the Australian Defence Force in this most recent set of disasters. This time has been no exception to their record. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say-perhaps in parenthesis-that they do attract occasionally some ill-informed minority criticism for their efforts and I will deal with that in a moment, but that is by and large very much a minority. Most people, I know, expect the armed forces to react in that way; they expect volunteers and emergency bodies to respond quickly and efficiently and it is only in a minor way that they are criticised. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend some time outlining what assistance is given by the Commonwealth in natural disasters of this kind. I am aware that the Deputy Leader spent some time on perhaps the deficiencies of responses either by State governments or in coordination arrangements between the States and the Commonwealth, and I will deal with that a little later after I have spoken about the assistance that the Commonwealth itself provides. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is perhaps the most visible form of assistance; namely, the physical assistance that is provided by the Australian Defence Force and I will get on in a moment to the financial assistance which is provided under the natural disaster relief arrangements or NDRA. Neither of those forms of assistance is new. They have been developed over a considerable period of time. They have been, I think, generally regarded as effective under this Government and previous governments. Under this Government, in the case of the most recent disasters, those arrangements were activated very rapidly. Assistance began on 13 April, quite soon after the scope of the disaster became clear, with airlifts of supplies and the dropping of fodder by Caribou and Hercules aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> The disaster plan, Emperor, was, in fact, activated on 21 April with the deployment of armed forces, and that phase lasted until 1 May. That kind of disaster assistance, quite properly, is given only in response to direct requests from State governments which are in the best position, at that point, to assess the scope of the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Operation Emperor the Australian Defence Force (ADF) met all the requests which were made by State governments with one exception, and that was a request for additional manpower in Nyngan. That request was cancelled about an hour after it was made with the greatly changed circumstances which followed the breaching of the levy banks. The decision was made to evacuate Nyngan and that was done, basically, by ADF helicopters. At the height of the relief operation there were approximately 500 armed forces personnel and 39 aircraft being deployed, with additional manpower and equipment, which was not in fact needed, on standby. </PARA>
<PARA> I will run through the major tasks which were undertaken by the defence forces. Firstly, the evacuation of Charleville and Nyngan by helicopters. Secondly, the establishment of a tent city-temporary tent accommodation-for the 2,000 evacuees at Charleville. That tent city was supported by an infantry company of 135 personnel, plus catering and supply staff. Thirdly, medical facilities were provided at Charleville pending getting the hospital back into commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth major task, was the transport of food, fuel, relief personnel and supplies to isolated towns and individual homesteads by aircraft, helicopters and trucks. Fifthly, aerial fodder dropping-particularly in the Narromine, Walgett and St George areas-was carried out by Caribou and Hercules aircraft. Sixthly-and this group is still there, as I will refer to in a moment-an army engineer group of 130 men, 60 trucks and various plant and equipment is engaged on reconstruction work in the Jericho Shire, Queensland. Fodder dropping in south Queensland is continuing as the floods gradually move south. Other activities include food supplies flights to Bourke, Cobar and Brewarrina and helicopter relief operations at Enngonia in New South Wales and Charleville in Queensland-taking people off roofs, and so forth. These mopping up tasks are expected to continue until 11 May. </PARA>
<PARA> Pretty well all those activities have now been wound up in Queensland and have been taken over by the civil power. The helicopters have been replaced by civil charter aircraft, the tent city is no longer there and various stores have been returned to Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales my understanding is that fodder dropping is expected to continue for at least another three or four days-as of Friday, a Caribou and a Hercules were still engaged on that activity. In Nyngan there is a family assistance centre which has been set up by the Australian Defence Force in conjunction with the New South Wales Government. That is being staffed by eight members of the armed forces and a further 10 members are distributing food supplies and bedding by truck. Rear Admiral Sinclair has requested some transport facilities which have been made available. The Army Malaria Research Unit is advising on mosquito control. That is the picture given by the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very pleased to see that Senator Newman moved a motion which was carried unanimously in the Senate the other day which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) recognises the enormous assistance which has been given to our flood stricken victims by Australian Defence Force personnel;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) recognises that whenever disaster strikes in our country in peacetime or in war, the Australian Defence Force is willing ready and able to swing into action regardless of personal inconvenience or danger; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) expresses its gratitude to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force for their continuing selfless contribution to their fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that would command the same unanimous support in this House as it did in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the ADF, man does not live by bread alone. Just last week I was pleased to authorise the use of another Caribou aircraft to fly around to various towns in Queensland including Alpha, Charleville and Blackall. In this plane was Col Joye and the Joye Boys. The Deputy Leader of the National Party and I are probably the only people in this House old enough to remember them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am joking. Those of us who remember the work that Col Joye did in Vietnam in entertaining our troops will recognise that this is a similar operation. I was very pleased that he was able to do that, and I thank him and his group, including Julia Daniels, for the excellent work they are doing in Operation Cheer-up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I go on to other matters the emphasis now, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party has rightly pointed out, is on financial assistance provided under the NDRA. That form of relief is, constitutionally, primarily the responsibility of the States but the Commonwealth has always recognised that it will have a role when the States do not have the resources to deal with that kind of major disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I speak further about those arrangements the Deputy Leader of the National Party drew attention to a number of possible deficiencies; State responses to the disasters; coordination arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States; and databases-for example, we have not been collecting flood river data for long enough, as Nyngan showed, to make that a reliable guide. Rainfall records are also deficient. He mentioned that we need to look again at the appropriateness of the equipment which was used, in particular, whether the Chinook helicopters would have been more useful. My impression and understanding is that the ADF met the tasks assigned to it very well with the existing equipment. The Black Hawke helicopters are a very adaptable aircraft. They did everything that was required of them. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Deputy Leader of the National Party mentioned, it is the case that the Government has agreed to look again at the possible refurbishment of a small number of Chinooks. In agreeing to that, of course, the Government has to bear in mind that the ADF is there basically for the defence of the country. While dual use of this kind is useful and without pre-empting the results of that review it has to be the case that that will always be the prime reason why an item of equipment is retained in the ADF inventory. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of differences between States is largely a matter which will have to be sorted out by the States, but if there is a lesson to be learnt, obviously it is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the NDRA arrangements, the Commonwealth reimburses at least 50 per cent of State outlays on eligible measures for the relief of personal hardship and distress. In respect of other eligible relief and restoration measures, the Commonwealth provides financial assistance when a State's total outlays on those measures in any financial year exceeds its assessed financial capacity, as represented by an annual base amount. That base amount has been set at 0.225 per cent of State annual general government revenue and grants dating from two years earlier, which was the latest available data at the time. Commonwealth assistance is on a donor for donor basis in respect of outlays by a State above its base amount for amounts up to 75 per cent above the base amount and $3 Commonwealth to $1 State thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland the threshold is $15.78m, and it will be well above that largely because of earlier expenditure on Cyclone Ivu. Therefore, Queensland will get 3:1. In New South Wales the threshold is $32.75m. That State has spent $38.5m to date. In Victoria the threshold is $23.9m and my guess is that it will not, in fact, spend that. </PARA>
<PARA> The relief measures which have been funded under those guidelines have included grants for relief of personal hardship and distress, such as the provision of emergency food, clothing and accommodation; concessional loans to farmers and operators of small businesses and concessional loans to needy persons or voluntary non-profit bodies whose assets have been significantly damaged and have no reasonable access to commercial finance-the same applies to the previous category. There are also grants for the restoration of essential public assets owned by eligible public undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to a number of other measures briefly referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Government has taken steps to ensure that the tax and social security systems make proper allowance for the difficulties faced by individuals. Legislation is being enacted, for example, to double the initial payment of unemployment benefits to victims of disasters, and there are a number of other measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to echo briefly the remarks that were made about the representation in this place and in other parliaments of people in these stricken areas. The Deputy Leader referred to a number of those. I know personally that members of this House from both sides have done their damnedest to serve their constituents in their hour of need. I know that one of them, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), will be speaking later in this debate. I appreciate the spirit in which this matter has been raised. I hope that I have been able to enlighten the House with the Government's response to it. </PARA>

I spent yesterday in a town where one has not been able to buy a Mother's Day card for nearly a month, because of the flood damage to the sole newsagency there. I am referring, of course, to Nyngan.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Macquarie says, this will never be forgotten. Also, we will never forget the footage shown of the levee bank breaking and the youth of the town, who grew into adults, throwing themselves in front of the water trying in vain to stop it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the things that I saw yesterday and on previous visits so that the Government can understand how desperately assistance is needed. Towns like Nyngan, Charleville and those in east Gippsland have been affected badly. Unlike some of the coastal towns, where the water comes up quickly and then goes down as quickly, in Nyngan the water was up for a week or two. Yesterday I inspected the business houses and the ordinary houses. There are some 85 or 90 businesses in Nyngan, in a town of 2,700. The largest motel suffered $400,000 worth of damage. The food in the freezer alone was worth $20,000 and that had to be thrown out. That motel employs upwards of 20 people, including the cleaning staff, the staff in the cafe and those associated with other activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps some flexibility could be brought into the unemployment benefit system, with some sort of work for the dole scheme, so that those employees could receive unemployment benefit, to help with the clean up of that business until it can get going again. That would be a great help, and I hope the Government will take that suggestion on board. Such a scheme would help businesses not only in the town of Nyngan but also in those areas represented by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who are here today to listen to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Many businesses have had huge losses of stock and records. Their sales tax records and wage tax records have gone. Tolerance and understanding from the Australian Taxation Office will be needed in relation to this. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), referred to provisional tax and the fact that we will need tolerance from the Australian Taxation Office on the time needed to adjust the estimates downwards of businesses, and in relation to rebates where payments made are higher than what is expected due to the flood. Perhaps we will need consideration from Telecom, to waive the rent, as the phones have been out for so long. Perhaps that has not been considered as yet. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to go to towns like Nyngan to realise the effect that the flood has had. Shopkeepers have had to pull out the whole stock-not just what was affected and damaged permanently and thrown away on the tip, but even what has been salvaged because it has been on higher shelves. They have had to pull out not only the whole stock but also the carpets and lino, and whatever. Floorboards have had to be ripped up and they will have to pour cement floors. All this takes time, with loss of income, and it takes money. The level of loans in New South Wales has been lifted from $25,000, I think it was, up to $80,000, at 6 per cent, but I think more is needed. The State Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Gerry Peacocke, will be pressing for this. If the New South Wales State Government agrees to it, I hope the Commonwealth will come to the party under the Commonwealth-State agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation with people's homes is horrific, and there are 1,100 or 1,200 homes in Nyngan. In one home two railway sleepers went straight through the front door with the water that came in. Sewage has been surcharging through the systems. Yesterday I went into a pensioner's home, and it was devastating. I was told that this pensioner had been into her house once since the flood. She threw up her hands and broke down. She walked out and has not been back since. I ask the Government to have compassion over what will happen to these pensioners' homes. There are 270 pensioners in Nyngan over 70 years of age and many of their houses will have to be demolished. If a recommendation is put forward by Rear-Admiral Peter Sinclair that, for example, a retirement village complex has to be set up, I hope that the Government will see its way clear to look at that favourably. </PARA>
<PARA> To mention just one item in that house: the family piano, an heirloom that had been there for generations, had floated across the room and was face downwards on the floor. It was stood up when I went there yesterday. I tried to depress one of the ivory keys with my finger, but it was jammed. The keys were turned up and the veneer had peeled off everywhere. I lifted up the back to look inside and it was rusted up. It would now not get 10c at auction. It is worthless. That is the type of thing that people have lost. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no such thing, of course, as flood insurance. I believe that we have to have another look at a natural disaster insurance scheme. Nyngan is a low income town, but for the average home one would need $10,000 to replace just the basics, like stoves, television sets and modern furniture. Water causes modern furniture to come apart, because it is only stuck together with glue and staples-unlike antique furniture. That figure of $10,000 does not include things like carpets, gyprock walls, curtains and floorboards. The owners of one of the houses I looked at yesterday had only just finished painting the interior of the house-so that was $6,000 totally down the drain. I would ask the Government-and I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about this-to consider waiving the sales tax on the household items that Nyngan people will have to purchase to refurnish their homes. I am thinking of simple things like beds and mattresses. I believe that there is a 30 per cent sales tax on television sets-hardly a luxury item in an isolated town where there is not as much entertainment as there is in a city. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the Deputy Leader of the National Party has mentioned the problems in relation to special benefits and household support. I would ask the Government to look at that, too. I would also ask the Government to look at the need for proper flood gauges, automatic telemark flood gauges which are accurate and quick. Some sort of investigation needs to be done as to why personal gauge reader warnings were not heeded more than they were. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look at spending more on levee banks. The 10-kilometre levee bank at Nyngan has to be raised by another two metres, I believe-just for peace of mind, to get people to go back and live there again. Roads and bridges have sustained devastating damage and a lot of funding will be needed. We must not forget the farming community, either. I spoke to a fellow from Wanaaring a couple of days ago, Doug Bambrick. Wanaaring is a couple of hundred kilometres west of Bourke. This fellow has a 110,000 acre property and 12,000 sheep. He has been marooned for a month. He has been without mail for all that time. We get six mail deliveries here a day but he has not had mail for a month. He can only get around to the parts of the property near his house. </PARA>
<PARA> He has seen 2,000 of his sheep. He does not know where the other 10,000 are or whether they are alive or dead, because he cannot get a helicopter in to find that out. I asked him when he expected to get out again and he said, `With a bit of luck, about September'. He has no income. He has wool shorn from sheep in February and March sitting in the shed. He will not be able to sell that wool until later this year, and he will have to pay at least another 12 per cent in wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I would ask the Government to consider when we are discussing wool legislation on Thursday waiving the wool tax on what would have normally been sold as this year's clip. Just that item alone runs into several thousand dollars. That is the sort of thing that isolated graziers-the people who have opened up this country and who contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to our export income-are putting up with. Their children are not able to be educated. They cannot get out. There is no entertainment. All they have is a phone, a radio set and television. The more that we can do to help them the better. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray mentioned Chinook helicopters. I believe there is a need to have at least three or four such helicopters. We need to have some sort of vertical heavy lift capacity in this country. We cannot even take a 150 millimetre howitzer into the field these days. Chinook helicopters would have been very useful in the flood areas. If America is going to revamp 500 of these helicopters, surely we can afford to do the same with 11 of them in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, these floods have caused very serious problems. In many ways, some of the victims are the forgotten people of Australia. They live in isolated and harsh conditions to earn money for this country. They have pulled their weight in the past. I hope that in their hour of need, we will not forget them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the ongoing interest and real personal concern that has been expressed by members of the Opposition in the plight of the hundreds of Australian families who have been devastated because of the recent floods that have affected western Queensland and New South Wales. I concur with the general thrust of the proposition that has been put forward by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), when he says that there is a need for the Government to utilise all of the resources at its disposal to assist the recent victims of floods in eastern Australia. But as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) pointed out, that is exactly what the Federal Government-and I will add to that, the State governments in Queensland and New South Wales-have done in recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to place on record my admiration of and support for the actions of so many people, including representatives from this House of Parliament. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) was one of the first on the scene in Queensland. I would like to commend those political, administrative and defence officials who were also on the scene. I also commend the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, for his personal intervention, the Department of Social Security representatives who moved to the flood areas in Queensland to ensure that special benefits were available and Army personnel. These people provided the immediate assistance that was necessary, the counselling service that was needed, the financial help that was urgently required and the physical support, be it getting people out of their homes and building tent cities. They all deserve commendation. </PARA>
<PARA> This support was highlighted during the visit by the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he inspected areas of central and far western Queensland. I think everyone realises that everyone tried to do his bit. As I have said, assistance was provided not only at the Federal level but also at the State level. I again place on record my appreciation commendation of Terry Mackenroth, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services in Queensland, for the way he approached the issue. He did not just go out there but he stayed there. He camped with the people. He became involved with and suffered with the people. I think it is important that members of parliament do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was able to tell the House of the experiences he has just had. All Australians need to know of the suffering that has taken place. At the same time we need to record our appreciation of the role played by the State emergency services, the local authorities, the police, the departmental officials, the ambulance and the other support groups such as the fire brigades. We also need to recognise the role played by the health department, the Department of Primary Industries, the education department, the Department of Social Security, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Department of Family Services and so on. These are but some of the people who took action and did their bit. I would suggest that the action by these concerned people is beyond criticism. I am most pleased that the Opposition did not come forward with this matter of public importance today to try to criticise and have a crack at government. I am pleased with the thrust of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There was certainly a commitment and dedication to duty. I believe that this is matched only by the generosity of tens of thousands of Australians who were not directly affected but who put their hands into their pockets to ensure that money has been forthcoming. I cite a couple of quick examples. Today I received a cheque for $27,655 to the appeal that I am running in central Queensland from the miners at Blair Athol coal. The combined mining unions got together and raised $27,655. Their cheque, which arrived in my office at Rockhampton today, will be used to provide white goods-stoves and refrigerators and washing machines-for the people in Alpha, Jericho and other areas in central Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> A concert held in Emerald last Friday week was assisted by Mickey Calvert and James Dean from 4HI in cooperation with Alan Douglas, Laurie Esmond, Ric McGuire and many other people as well as all the service clubs, the banks and Sunstate Airlines. All sorts of people and organisations, including commercial interests, contributed. The breweries came good with pallets of grog. An amount of over $30,000 was raised in four hours thanks to the presence of the Little River Band, the Roccatoos and Antix, a well known local group. But the people came there to support the cause. I think we need to place on record the Parliament's support for and appreciation of what these people have done. </PARA>
<PARA> The money is pouring in. Today I spoke to Clem Jones who heads the Queensland task force for the Premier. He tells me that already $4m has arrived in the Queensland voluntary coffers just to support Queensland victims and that this amount is expected to rise to $5m. We can add to that the $27.6m already spent by the Queensland Government. As a Commonwealth Government, we are directly spending $12m as we match the money above the 0.225 per cent of revenue that the States must first contribute. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has pointed out, we are now going to contribute $3 for every $1 contributed by the State of Queensland. This money will help those people in distress. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a matter of what is going to be provided. It is also a matter of the immediate financial assistance and the personal help that has been given. Thanks to the arrangement that we have with the States, food, clothing, shelter and emergency services have been provided. I believe that Australia can hold its head very high in the way in which this disaster has been handled. It is a unique disaster. The Deputy Leader of the National Party pointed out the magnitude of the problem. It was described to me that it was as big as a flood covering half of Europe and that its cost is something like a quarter of a billion dollars. We cannot conjure up in our minds the extent of the damage. </PARA>
<PARA> As Clem Jones said, it is unparalleled. Unlike the flood that took place in Brisbane, the people could not just shift out of their neighbourhood and stay with neighbours. These people had nowhere to go. Clem Jones said that when he walked into the towns there were no radios, telephones, railways, buses or taxis. There was nothing. The people had to live in tent cities, thanks to the Army and the support made available by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> These incredible problems continue. Clem Jones has been trying to get underlay for 1,300 homes so that floor covering could be put down. He has already bought out all the vinyl in Mackay, Emerald and Rockhampton. He has been trying to buy floor coverings from other cities. The aim has been to try and buy things locally. Just last week he distributed $300,000 in vouchers-$100 per adult and $20 per child. This money has been made available by way of vouchers so that it can be spent locally. Another $300,000 to $400,000 is being spent today. By the end of the week $1.2m will have been made available by way of vouchers. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of this, $1,000 per household in Queensland will be given in voucher form so that householders can go along and buy the things that they need, be it beds, furniture or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> The generosity is unprecedented. When I made a public appeal for beds, one of the hospitals rang up and said, `We have 16-they are on their way'. When I made an appeal for stoves, one of the mining companies said, `We have five stoves. We are delivering them personally'. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I spoke to Bob Mellis, the Shire Clerk in Alpha, and said, `Bob, what about the goods we were going to send in respect of furniture?' He said, `Three wagon loads have just arrived. I do not even know what is in them. Do not send any more before we have an inventory'. Peter Clark, the local police officer, is of the same attitude. People have been generous beyond all belief. It is unbelievable what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few moments that I have in this debate I want to take up some points that have been raised by honourable members. I believe that the generosity should not stop there. A sympathetic approach must be taken by the Australian Taxation Office. Business and individuals have lost all of their documents. They have lost everything. It is not just a matter of their losing personal effects; they have lost everything in terms of being able to demonstrate their income over the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an unbelievable loss for business. That business loss shall flow not just to those in the affected area but to others in the non-affected areas. I have one businessman in Rockhampton who stands to lose $47,000 in debts owed to him by businessmen in those areas who simply cannot pay him. He could face bankruptcy. There is going to be a need for sympathy and compassion at every government level to ensure that we will accept delays in these returns. I would hope too that we can expand the system of assistance going to those business people and to the farmers, to repair the fences, to clean out the dams and to try to solve the problem of soil erosion that is so widespread across tens of thousands of acres. </PARA>
<PARA> I would make the appeal that the Australian people do not stop now with their compassion and care and generosity but that they remember that in the weeks to come the recreation fields, the school halls and the community facilities will have to be repaired. The money will still be needed. We will still have to deal with the psychological trauma of those families. I would suggest that there is a need to realise that this problem will go on and on for thousands of families for weeks and weeks to come. I would also make the suggestion that maybe, despite the argument against a national disaster fund and a national disaster insurance scheme, we need to have a look at the concept again. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I ask that this debate not be seen as a debate between the Opposition and Government but instead it be seen as some type of motion or statement that is congratulating the people of Australia for their dedication, commitment and compassion during this recent disaster. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Oakleigh Multi-User Army Reserve Depot, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the construction of a multi-user depot at Oakleigh, Victoria, for use by various Army Reserve units. The construction of the new depot is primarily the result of a request from the Victorian State Government that the site of an existing depot in Batman Avenue, East Melbourne, adjacent to the National Tennis Centre, be vacated for use as open space. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth agreed to make the land available to the Victorian State Government as part of a wider Commonwealth-State land transfer agreement involving various properties in Melbourne. In relation to the Batman Avenue depot, defence relocation costs were to be met and the Commonwealth was not to be financially disadvantaged overall. The construction of a new depot will also allow rationalisation and collocation of like Army Reserve functions which is consistent with this Government's policy of rationalising and upgrading defence facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> A suitable 3.17 hectare site for the construction of the new depot has been purchased at Oakleigh some 16 kilometres from the Melbourne central business district. When purchased the site, which was previously an abattoir, included disused and derelict buildings unsuitable to form part of the depot complex. Australian Construction Services, with approval from the Public Works Committee (PWC), let a contract for the demolition of these buildings in December 1989 and this demolition work is now complete. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed work, in addition to the demolition work, includes construction of offices, administrative and storage facilities, training facilities, a vehicle compound, parade ground, recreational and some food preparation facilities, as well as car parking and security fencing. Landscaping and engineering services for the site will also be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Once complete this depot will provide a home to Army Reserve headquarters and units of the Royal Australian Engineers, Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, and the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps in line with current defence policy of multi-user, or shared, accommodation for like Reserve Army functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to unavoidable delays expected from the recent dissolution of Parliament, and the need to refer this project to a new Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, agreement was sought from the previous Public Works Committee to progress the project to the stage of calling tenders. Australian Construction Services, on behalf of the Department of Defence, called tenders at the end of last month, to close late this month, pending completion of the current PWC process. The limit of cost estimate for the project, including demolition work, is $9m at November 1989 prices. As stated earlier, the demolition work is complete and construction of the new depot on the Oakleigh site is planned for commencement in mid-1990 with completion expected in late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of the proposed work on the environment has been determined as minimal and the site at Oakleigh is appropriately zoned as general industrial. Construction of the new depot will provide in the order of 20 to 25 jobs on site, as well as opportunities for local contractors and suppliers of building materials and equipment. </PARA>

<PARA>This proposal involves the construction of a purpose designed multistorey building with associated engineering services to house the Federal Court of Australia, Family Court of Australia, Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Commonwealth Reporting Service in central Brisbane. Honourable members may recall that approval to refer this proposal was given at the sitting of this House on 22 December 1989.

However, the calling of the Federal election prevented the Committee's report from being tabled and an expediency motion from being moved. </PARA>
<PARA> The selected site faces North Quay and the Brisbane River with side boundaries facing Tank Street to the north-west and Turbot Street to the south-east. At present, the Federal and Family Courts, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Commonwealth Reporting Service are accommodated in leased premises scattered around central Brisbane.

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Puckapunyal Redevelopment Stage 1, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The Puckapunyal military area is situated in Victoria, approximately 11 kilometres west of the town of Seymour and 100 kilometres north of Melbourne, and was originally established as an Army training centre for new recruits prior to, and during, World War II. Puckapunyal has been the main training centre for the armoured corps since 1942. The Puckapunyal military area is currently home to three major operational units, two of which are part of the operational deployment force, a newly formed logistic battalion, three major training establishments and various minor units. It is considered a significant defence base by the Australian Defence Force employing approximately 2,000 service men and women. The area consists of three distinct and special purpose zones. The range complex, covering 42,500 hectares, is used for training and is capable of brigade size exercises and live deployment of all major weapons deployed by the Army. The military cantonment, or soldier accommodation, is located in the south east corner of the range complex. </PARA>
<PARA> The third zone is the Puckapunyal village which includes married quarters for service personnel and dependants which, at present, total approximately 2,200. A study being conducted by the Australian Defence Families and Information Liaison Staff is aimed at identifying community needs through liaison with the Puckapunyal community. The redevelopment of Puckapunyal is directly in line with the Government's commitment to improving existing living-in accommodation and rationalising and modernising working accommodation and facilities as stated in the defence policy information paper titled The Defence of Australia 1987. Increases in occupational health and safety requirements and the services' scales and standards of accommodation have meant that deficiencies now exist in working accommodation at Puckapunyal. These deficiencies have had detrimental effects on the management of some functions at the base. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed work currently before the House is the first part of a two-stage redevelopment program for the area and will basically involve replacing substandard living-in accommodation, upgrading engineering services and replacing and refurbishing working accommodation to house the newly formed Puckapunyal logistic battalion. Environmental effects of the planned development will be minimal and an environmental certificate of compliance has been issued. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed stage 1 redevelopment work will be undertaken in two phases at a limit of cost estimate of $31.5m, at July 1989 prices. Work is due to commence in the latter half of 1990-91. The redevelopment work at the Puckapunyal military area will provide opportunities for business in surrounding country areas for the supply of building materials and equipment and provide up to 55 jobs on site. I table selected drawings of the proposed stage 1 redevelopment of Puckapunyal military area and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

Obviously, this work is long overdue. While we welcome the action, we would also have to point out that the delays by this Government really are nothing short of a disgrace, and I think the fact that our service men and women have put up with these conditions for so long is a credit to them, but it is certainly no credit to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Housing Developments by the Defence Housing Authority at Laverton and Macleod, Victoria and Bullsbrook, Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>In January 1988 the Government established the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) to provide a better standard, and an increased choice, of housing for defence personnel and their families, consistent with community standards. On its establishment the Defence Housing Authority took over responsibility for some 23,000 houses and has a current investment program in excess of $100m per annum. In line with the Government's commitment to improve housing for defence families the Defence Housing Authority recently purchased a 32.5-hectare site at Laverton in Victoria and a 21-hectare site at Bullsbrook in Western Australia. The Authority is also negotiating for the purchase of a 50-hectare site at Macleod in Victoria from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Housing Authority intends to develop these sites under arrangements with private sector developers. The benefits of such arrangements which utilise private sector expertise are twofold. Firstly, it will provide significant opportunities for local private sector companies and employment for a significant number of people in each area. Secondly, as it is proposed to sell off 50 to 66 per cent of the developed lots on the private market to civilians it will assist in the Defence Housing Authority's mission to integrate defence and civilian housing and provide a greater housing choice for defence families. It is expected that ultimate development of these three sites will yield some 980 houses at a total cost of $145m. Of this total some 400 houses will be retained by the DHA with 100 each at Laverton and Bullsbrook and 200 at Macleod. </PARA>
<PARA> The Laverton site, which will yield 400 lots, is located close to existing defence employment centres and it is planned to commence subdivisional development in the second half of 1990. The Macleod site, which was part of the Simpson Army Barracks, will yield up to 420 lots and is situated 18 kilometres north-east of Melbourne. Development plans currently include generous open space, an ornamental lake, retention of significant river red gums and a range of community facilities. The site is planned to be developed in four stages with the first stage commencing in mid-1991 and the first homes being available towards the end of 1991. The Bullsbrook site will provide housing to replace the ex-Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (Servicemen) houses at Bullsbrook purchased by DHA in February 1989. The proposed development, which is adjacent to these ex-Commonwealth State Housing Agreement houses, will yield 180 allotments, of which 100 will be retained by DHA for the construction of project homes for defence families. Construction of the subdivision will commence mid-1990 and the Authority expects that the first homes will be occupied by defence families towards the end of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> All three projects will be subject to the relevant State planning and rezoning processes. The two Victorian projects are presently zoned for Commonwealth defence purposes and Bullsbrook is partly zoned residential and partly rural. All projects will be zoned residential under State legislation. For all projects, the due process of public comment and environmental impact under the relevant State legislation will be observed. </PARA>
<PARA> An area of land has been set aside for community facilities including a child-care centre within the proposed Macleod development. Investigations relating to the Bullsbrook proposal suggest that the development is not large enough to require additional community facilities. The need for additional community facilities at Laverton is currently being investigated. I table supporting drawings and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey, Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works acknowledges the great effort that we are putting in for it today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Oakey Army Aviation Centre, situated on 220 hectares of land near the township of Oakey on the Darling Downs-and it is very good country, too-160 kilometres west of Brisbane, was originally established in 1941 for use by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. In 1969 the Army took control of the airfield. Since then a number of developments have taken place including provision of temporary and permanent facilities for units currently housed on the base. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the airfield is home to the School of Army Aviation, 1st Aviation Regiment-with the exception of two squadrons located in Sydney and Townsville-1st Aviation Regiment workshop, 173 General Support Squadron and workshop, Oakey Workshop Battalion and the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Aircraft Maintenance School. All of these units are administratively coordinated and controlled by the headquarters Army aviation centre, which is also located at the base. Currently the base houses 55 aircraft and approximately 196 vehicles and trailers and employs 734 Army personnel and 51 civilian staff. This employment figure is expected to rise to a total of 863 by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> The airfield at Oakey is a joint user aerodrome, the Department of Defence, Army, being the principal user with the Department of Transport and Communications as the tenant accounting for approximately 15 per cent of total aircraft movements. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with this Government's commitment to enhancing our defence capabilities, and as stressed in the defence policy information paper of 1987, there is a continued need for Army aviation assets and an extensive infrastructure of bases, airfields, training and other facilities to support the operations of the Australian Defence Force. The centre at Oakey is a major part of that infrastructure providing the core for both aviation training and support for the Army throughout Australia. Described as particularly suitable to aircraft operations, Oakey is the preferred possible site, over Fairbairn, for any triservice helicopter pilot training school. </PARA>
<PARA> The works currently before the House form stage one of a two-stage redevelopment aimed at rectifying significant occupational health and safety deficiencies and upgrading working conditions at the base. In particular, stage one will involve the construction of permanent facilities for 1st Aviation Regiment, who still occupy temporary facilities constructed in 1969 and 1973 General Support Squadron. Extension to the existing hangar and technical facilities used by 1st Aviation Regiment workshop and extension-refurbishment of aircraft maintenance facilities for Oakey Workshop Battalion. Also included are civil work and extensions to existing engineering services. </PARA>
<PARA> Once complete, these works will provide purpose designed working facilities for Army units located at the base and ensure the continued provision of services undertaken at the airfield and provide a centralised helicopter pilot training school once training facilities are complete in 1990. As part of the training school a number of Black Hawk helicopters will eventually be housed at Oakey. </PARA>
<PARA> The limit of cost for the stage one redevelopment is estimated at $14.6m at September 1989 prices. The proposed works are expected to go to tender in September 1990, subject to a favourable Public Works Committee report, with progressive completion through to 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed works are expected to provide employment for up to 80 personnel on site and substantial opportunities for local contractors and subcontractors as well as supplies of building materials, plant and equipment in the Oakey area. I table selected plans of the proposed stage one redevelopment at Oakey and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 1, 2 and 3 (1990). </PARA>
<PARA>The Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the recent dissolution of the Parliament. Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 is new and the proposed alterations are minor and duty rates are not affected. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2, which operate on and from 1 March 1990, contain a series of alterations made in the context of the post-1988 assistance arrangements for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 1 inserts new quota tender and tender extension duty rates for TCF goods for the period from 1 March 1990 to 28 February 1991 following the determination of rates under the 1990 tender quota scheme. Included in the quota arrangements for the period is the introduction of tender extension rates for industrial crafts. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 2 (1990) removes New Zealand duty rates from certain plastic-coated textiles of subheadings 5903.10.90, 5903.20.90 and 5903.90.90; and inserts a new note 5 in schedule 5. The note directs that separate tariff treatment should not be accorded to badges, labels, logos and the like which are incorporated in industrial craft garments and articles of apparel. </PARA>
<PARA> The alterations contained in Customs Tariff Proposals No. 3, which will operate on and from 1 July 1990, remove redundant duty rates from those goods where phasing rates have been fully implemented. There has been some amalgamation of national tariff subheadings. This action is seen as a measure to simplify the tariff by removing unnecessary rates and subheadings. </PARA>
<PARA> Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990 was introduced last week into this House and is a complete change of direction. That change is embodied in the title in clause 3, which provides that it is the intention to replace bounty entitlements for yarn with capitalisation grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I must say that we do not oppose the thrust of this Bill if it does what it implies, and as is proposed in clause 21c. It is implied that there will be, firstly, reduced Commonwealth expenditure with which we obviously agree; secondly, accelerated restructuring of industry; and, thirdly, the potential for accelerating the reduction of reliance on assistance from government by industry, or, as the Bill says, reduce the dependence of those industries on assistance from the Commonwealth. That is totally consistent with coalition policy. As a consequence, it gives industry a chance to be more internationally competitive and potentially it gives industry a way of getting better value for bounty money by putting the onus for restructuring back on the companies in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not debating the merits of the existing entitlements scheme, which has some shortcomings, but that scheme will no doubt be looked at in the mid-term review. However, the industry would be entitled to continuing assistance under the current bounty legislation until 1995 even if this Bill had not appeared. We are considering a new method of delivering a lesser level of entitlements in net present value terms, but nevertheless entitlements received early and in advance of those that would have been delivered under the present annual bounty arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> We have consulted with industry and industry associations and we understand that the provisions of this Bill arose from some suggestions to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA). No-one disputes the importance of restructuring. However, modifying tariff and bounty schemes is only part of what must be done to restructure the industry as a whole. For further restructuring to be successful, we certainly are going to need labour market reforms. We are going to need wages and conditions arrangements that do not build in inflation and we are going to need transport reforms, reduced regulations, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to this Bill, we have satisfied ourselves to the best of our ability, in the limited time we have been given, on a number of points. First of all, as I said, industry is reasonably happy with the proposition and it has the choice of whether to take advantage of it or not. We have an assurance from the Department that this proposition does not interfere and is consistent with existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade arrangements. We have several reservations, however, which I will detail shortly. Before doing so, I have an in-principle amendment which I will put now. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Bill should contain provision to ensure that;</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the making of a capitalisation grant to a textile yarn producer is limited to expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) where, in any case of Commonwealth funding being made and lost (for example, in the case of a textile yarn producer being declared bankrupt), any subsequent owner of the productive capacity is not eligible for payment of bounty-that is to prevent `double dipping' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>We understand that the Government now accepts some of those reservations and that some of the identified deficiencies may be remedied by Government amendments during the committee stage of this Bill. However, I would like to expand on the reservations which the in-principle amendment addresses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is, in our view, not clear enough in providing that these capitalisation grants cannot be used for start-up capital. That is, the grants should not be able to be obtained for yarn production capacity that currently does not exist in the industry. Whilst making that point, we understand that under this scheme there can be a transfer of ownership of existing capacity and that the words `a person who is likely to become a producer of bountiable yarn during the bounty period' mean that there can be a transfer of ownership from one owner to another. I have been told by departmental officers that it is not the intention for it to be used as a source of new start-up capital for new ventures. We would like an assurance from the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) that that is the case under this Bill and that this scheme will not be used for such arrangements. Specifically, we would like an assurance that to receive a grant the applicant must be a producer of bountiable yarn and have lodged a claim for bounty, and that the making of a capitalisation grant to a textile yarn producer is limited to expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second point, that is, double dipping, we are satisfied that any debts arising out of the unfulfilled obligations by the recipient of the grant to the Commonwealth are reasonably well covered- that is under clause 21f with one exception, and that is in the case of bankruptcy or double dipping. I am advised that the Government now intends moving amendments to address this deficiency, and this shows the importance of allowing sufficient time for parliamentary scrutiny of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several other reservations about which we would like particular assurances from the Minister. We would like an assurance from the Minister of even-handed treatment of all applicants or applications. We would also like the TCFDA to publish guidelines on the type of proposal that would be acceptable for payment of grant, given that this legislation appears to have arisen from industry suggestions and our concerns about start-up capital. The House will have noticed that there have been comments in some places as to various commercial propositions that are or may be in the wind, so to speak. Thus the question arises, secondly, as to whether there are any arrangements or understandings that have already been made between the Government or its agencies and the industry, current or potential, in regard to this matter of capitalisation grants and that have not been announced to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I ask the Minister in his response to the second reading debate to indicate whether there are any such arrangements or understandings and, if so, to provide some details as to their nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) on his Bill, the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990. I am very pleased to see a fellow Queenslander in the Ministry and certainly a Queenslander who has a full understanding of rural issues and rural areas, given that he represents a rural electorate. The proposed amendments to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 will provide persons currently eligible for bounty assistance under the Act with an alternative to assistance, that is, as has been mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), a one-off capitalisation grant in lieu of any future possible bounty receipts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that, apart from anything else, such a scheme as this will provide the opportunity for accelerated restructuring of the industry while simultaneously granting net reductions in budgetary outlays to the Commonwealth. I do not believe that anyone has or will have any problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The main features of the proposed capitalisation grant are that current or likely producers of textile yarn may apply to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority and that applications submitted will have to include a comprehensive business plan that outlines the methods by which the applicant will achieve his objectives on a yearly basis against certain specified criteria. Included in the applicant's submission will be an estimate of the grant sought to enable the implementation of his business plan. In other words, it has to be well thought out and presented in a proper and fit manner. </PARA>
<PARA> After prompt consideration of all applications, the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority will report to the Minister with a recommendation stating whether the grant should be made and, if so, the amount of that grant, having given regard to certain factors. One of those factors is that the financial viability of the applicant's business plan has to be guaranteed. In other words, there is a thorough research on the plan that has been put forward by the applicant and consideration given to whether or not the making of the grant would result in an ultimate saving to the Commonwealth on the bounty. That ensures that both the producer and the Commonwealth benefit from some significant monetary saving. Under the current bounty textile yarn arrangements, Commonwealth outlays between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1995 are likely to reach approximately $400m in present dollar values. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of the potential outlay of reductions as a result of the new scheme will depend upon the number of applicants. It is not possible to foresee that at this stage. To me, the biggest benefit will be that it will make us more internationally competitive and will give to producers or prospective producers of yarn a choice as to the way they wish to go. It is important, if we are going to expand our export industries, that we be internationally competitive. Anything that helps add value to rural commodities is very welcome, given the fact that some 69 per cent of our gross domestic product is based on primary or resource industries. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to continually fight-I think the previous speaker mentioned the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade-to make sure that we operate on a fair playing field. It is rather cynical that the most powerful nations on earth that can, at the press of a button, destroy the world hide behind high protection. When it comes to the really tough issue, free trade, they squib on it. Australia leads the way in fighting and pushing for free trade. In years to come we will stand tall because of that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have massive potential in regard to value-adding our rural commodities in two areas. One is Asia, as the standard of living improves and there is a bigger surplus of consumer spending. The other interesting scenario is eastern Europe. I think everyone is pleased to see what has happened there in the last six months. As those nations embrace democracy and start to restructure their industries there will be greater demands for products, possibly in the short term raw materials but, as their standard of living improves, most certainly value-added products. I believe that, providing we maintain top quality, we will get access to those markets. It matters little whether we sell our commodities in one form or another, providing we can get access to the markets. If at the same time they are value-added here, the jobs and the profit will be here and we will be much the better for it. </PARA>
<PARA> So on that basis I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill. Once again I compliment the Minister. He has a very good understanding of rural industries, the need to value-add and the need to get some competitiveness back into these sorts of industries. As I said, I am pleased to see bipartisan support for this Bill. As the honourable member for Barker has pointed out, the Opposition has no problems with this Bill. In regard to the need to restructure right across the board, I believe that we are showing the way. We are going to take on the tough issues within the shipping industry, as the majority of our commodities have to be exported. We have gone a long way down that track in a few years compared with the last 40. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area is the restructuring of the labour market, where we are doing a great job, given that we do not have industrial disputation and that real unit labour costs are much lower than they were prior to 1983. I have much pleasure in supporting the legislation before the House tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in speaking on the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990. The Bill proposes to amend the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 to provide those who are currently eligible for bounty assistance under the Act with the alternative assistance scheme which will take the form of a one-off capitalisation grant paid instead of possible future receipts of bounty over a period of five years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The total bounties payable under the current scheme over the next five years are estimated to total approximately $400.94m on current dollar values. As my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) has pointed out, the coalition supports the basic premise in the Bill, that is, to reduce government expenditure, to deregulate and restructure industry and to reduce dependence upon government assistance. The challenge to government as far as we are concerned is to remove the impediments which stand in the way of improved enterprise productivity and competitiveness, not just in industries such as textiles but right across the entire economy so we can have an industry base which is capable both of exporting and of import substitution. Regrettably, in so many areas of Australian secondary industry that is currently not the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Improvements in productivity would stabilise and reduce inflationary pressures on the economy, improve our poor trade deficit, reduce our mounting foreign debt and ultimately improve the standard of living for all Australians which has deteriorated significantly under seven years of Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian manufacturing needs to be matured and provided with the right environment to achieve a more productive outcome so that it will survive in an increasingly competitive world market. We believe that Australia must move at a much greater speed to achieve the changes necessary to facilitate a better position in world markets. Future generations, no doubt, will look back on the last seven years and see that much of that time has been wasted because, whilst numerous reports have been brought forward, there has been scarcely any significant fundamental change-above all, change in the attitude which people should have if this country is to be able to be got off its knees and back into a truly competitive situation internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> What my colleague the honourable member for Barker pointed out in his opening address was that, while we support the thrust of this legislation, nevertheless there are aspects of it which we are concerned about and to which we trust the Minister for Customs and Small Business (Mr Beddall), in his summing up at the end of the debate, will draw the attention of the House. For example, he identified the question of start-up capital or new start-up capital; he identified the question of the transfer of ownership and the question as to whether or not these benefits will be available to people who were previously producers, who sell their companies and their productive capacity to a third party and who then may have access to the same level of bounty support, whether through capitalisation or through the conventional means. In other words, to what extent will using existing capacity be seen as one of the sine qua non for access to these capitalisation grants?</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has based its economic policy on a total reliance on tight monetary policy, with resultant high interest rates. This has produced an unsustainable situation for many industries, with incumbent volatility in the currency. A Liberal-National Party government will pursue more responsible fiscal and monetary policies to ensure a more stable macro-economic environment for industry. We see this as absolutely fundamental, as I said, if the Australian industrial base is going to be expanded and directed at those areas where we are capable of competing on world standards, on world terms. We believe that the complex system of industry assistance, of tariffs, of quotas and bounties, developed in Australia since Federation, has in fact worked against the nation's best interests and has created an inward looking manufacturing sector, insulated from the discipline of competition and often too heavily reliant on assistance from governments of all colours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government received a review of textile yarn bounty administration in the form of a discussion paper from the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority in September 1989. This was in response to a request from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in January of the same year. It is interesting that the terms of reference for the review excluded `examination of programmed levels of assistance accorded yarn production under the TC and F plan'. Furthermore, the report, which was meant to be presented to the Minister by 30 September last year, ended up as a mere discussion paper. It therefore contains no reference to the complete change of policy which is now contained in the Bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in accordance with the terms of reference, the review did not cover `the merits of textile yarn bounties compared to some other possible forms of assistance or to consider varying the overall level of budgetary assistance accorded the yarn production sector as part of that policy'. Nevertheless, we are assured on page 7 of the review that after consultations on the discussion paper, a final report will be presented to the Minister. But there is no indication as to when this will take place and thus the question must be asked: What was the basis for this early legislation? Why was it that the Government proposed a fundamental change in the direction of bounty policy and in the substance of bounty policy, without in fact waiting for the final report to be brought forward?</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the objective of Government policy, which is to encourage the development of industries which are internationally competitive and capable of operating in the longer term with less taxpayer funded support. Clearly, we must move away from the protection of industry as a means of assistance and rather emphasise the improvement of industry efficiency and competitiveness as a clear objective of policy. Much has been said about this in recent years, but I come back to what I said initially: while much has been said, relatively little has been done either in fundamental change of policy or in evidence before us to indicate the success of that change of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs for Australian manufacturing continue to be reduced to either 10 or 15 per cent, but among the exceptions are the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industries, which are subject to sectoral plans. We can only hope that the sectoral plans for this industry are more successful than reports would suggest they have been in relation to the vehicle manufacturing sector. In the past, bounties have been provided as an alternative to tariff protection, as a means of avoiding loading the costs of industry assistance on to the taxpayer. The other advantage of bounty assistance is that the amount provided can be clearly identified, although in recent years with the reduction in industry assistance we have seen greater emphasis placed upon macro-economic management as the be-all and end-all of the Government's current problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 the total assistance to industry amounted to some $250m, of which textile yarn bounties accounted for 35 per cent or approximately $90m. The textiles, clothing and footwear plan has, as its fundamental objective, encouraging industries, which are efficient and inter-nationally competitive, to place greater emphasis on innovation and exports, while at the same time reducing dependence on taxation support. The main elements of the plan include industry development measures and changes to protection and labour adjustment assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the plan came into operation on 1 March 1989 and is scheduled to run to mid-1995, the authority is required to complete a mid-term review by 1992. Again I therefore have to ask the question: Why has the Government made this fundamental change of policy in what can best be described as an atmosphere of some haste? Therefore, the Opposition is entitled to ask the question, in the context of this fundamental change of policy in relation to textile yarn bounties: what effect will this particular decision have on the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, and will the Government proceed to apply the same concept of capitalisation grants as an alternative to regular bounty payments to other industries receiving assistance?</PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members read carefully the explanatory memorandum attached to the Act and in fact the actual terminology of the Act itself they will see that it is perfectly clear that this is not necessarily going to be a one-off venture. I ask the Minister to explain clearly to the House whether he intends that the capitalisation grant concept will in fact be extended beyond the textiles, clothing and footwear area-certainly beyond the question of yarns-and, if so, will it be to other elements of the TCF bounty category as well?</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of textile bounties themselves, they accounted for some $86.9m of budgetary assistance to yarn producers in 1988-89. Under the plan we are told that they will be progressively reduced to some 30 per cent of factory value added by 1994, which in 1986 terms would represent a tariff of approximately 15 per cent. Since much is made in the plan of the need to provide a predictable and sustainable policy environment, my earlier question becomes particularly relevant, because annual expenditure on textile yarn bounties was $23m in 1981-82 but, as I have stated, it rose to $86.9m in 1988-89. In fact, over this period bounty assistance to the yarn sector has totalled $588m; not a mere bagatelle in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA> Recipients of the bounty show some interesting variations. There are approximately 27 companies or 30 per cent which receive less than $50,000, or approximately half a million dollars or less than one per cent of all bounties, while there are 15 companies or 17 per cent of the total which receive over $1m each or nearly $70m in total, or 81 per cent of all bounties paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The textile yarn industry in Australia, as elsewhere, is dominated of course by large producers, which tend to integrate on a vertical basis their downstream processing. For example, there are a number of corporate groups. These include JGL Investments Proprietary, otherwise known as Fibremakers Australia Pty Ltd, which has two major production units and has bounty worth $30.6m In terms of recipients, they get 36 per cent of the total bounty. There is Linter Groups Ltd, which has three major units. It gets $14.6m or 17 per cent of the total bounties. The other producers are significantly less than that. Nevertheless, the total of those five producers alone comes to $61.8m, or 72 per cent of the total. </PARA>
<PARA> The textiles industry also produces a range of fibres, the main one being man-made fibre which receives a bounty of over $31m. Cotton bounty receivers total $25.7m, while wool receives a mere $3.5m, worsteds $13m and carpet $4.3m. This group therefore makes up about 84 per cent of the total of all bounties paid under this category. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the ultimate test in terms of the objectives of the Government's policy will be determined by whether it has succeeded over time in effectively increasing exports, directly or indirectly, or equally as important, reducing the flow of imports in this particular category. The picture here, regrettably, is somewhat confusing. According to the survey contained in the discussion paper, bounties paid on exports were worth $427,000 on total exports of $5m. Consequently, most of the production of these plants is used for Australian domestic production, much of which hopefully does find its way into the export market, but regrettably not sufficient to really justify at this time the level of those particular bounties. </PARA>
<PARA> While some 20 companies were engaged in yarn exports only one received in excess of $30,000 in bounty which, I think, emphasises the point I am making. In other words, the rest were insignificant in terms of their export potential. While many more companies-60-claimed they were exporting at a post-yarn stage of production which does not qualify them for the bounty, they believe that there were still further export opportunities. What we need to establish is precisely what are those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Significantly, when asked if the current bounty system acted as a disincentive to exports, 22 companies-24 per cent of the total including, I might add, some of the main recipients-said yes, and 46 companies, 51 per cent, said no. Those who saw the bounty as a disincentive claimed that it penalised the efficient producer while subsidising the less efficient. They also claimed that it deterred capital investment and should be extended to exports as an incentive to local producers and to match what other countries provide. One of the problems here is international agreements which we have entered into, and whether it will be possible to do that. Nevertheless, there is a serious conceptual problem in that Australian manufacturing industries perceive that there is a range of ways, in international markets, by which their entry can be controlled or limited. Therefore, they believe they are facing a disincentive in terms of exports to various other markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the bounty is less on export sales, this also causes them to be marginal in comparison to domestic sales, which clearly has a built-in advantage. Significantly, it was also claimed that the policy discriminates against the export of wool rich carpets. The carding wool industry has particular problems, not the least of which is the significant competition it faces from New Zealand wools. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we are really facing a fundamental need for a value added base for as many of our domestic based industries as possible. Certainly, the yarn industry is one of those in which the value added component is of fundamental importance if we are going to be able to enter international markets and compete effectively when we get there. </PARA>
<PARA> On this evidence, and supported by industry submissions, it would appear that exports of yarn will not increase above the standing of marginal activity for producers unless the bias of incentives towards domestic production in relation to exports is corrected. I see that as one of the fundamental problems facing the Government in the application of this policy, and one upon which very little has been said by the Minister in his second reading speech. I trust he will direct his efforts to that in his concluding remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, it is clear that the benefit of the yarn bounty is to those producers of fabrics who export only at the fabric stage because the exporter at the yarn stage receives a much lower bounty uplift. If the objective-and I assume that it is-of government policy is to achieve longer production runs and, thus, greater economies of scale, clearly, access to export markets for yarn should be at least on an equal footing with access to the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on Monday, 14 May. The headline was, `Govt attacked on textile bill'. Whether the word `attacked' is appropriate is a matter of some doubt. As my colleague the honourable member for Barker pointed out in his opening remarks there is concern in the industry, and it is exemplified in this article, as to whether the application of the capitalisation grants will be fair to all participants in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the article refers to the question of one of the world's largest fibre manufacturers, E. I. Du Pont de Nemours. It is suggested that the Liberman family synthetic yarn producer, Fibremakers, is likely to be taken over by Du Pont. Of course, the question which arises in that particular context is what access would Du Pont have to the capitalisation grants which may be granted initially to Fibremakers, or which may be subject-if Fibremakers wish to continue with the conventional system-to the year by year arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are concerned about, and what the honourable member for Barker emphasised, is when we are talking about the transfer of ownership-and we are assuming that the transfer of ownership can only be, therefore, to an existing producer-surely the question arises whether Du Pont is an existing producer. Clearly, in the Australian environment the answer has to be no, although internationally quite clearly it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question which comes up concerns the start-up capital for new plant. In this case we assume we are not talking about new plant; we are talking about the transfer of ownership of existing plant. Therefore, a company has to be an existing producer to qualify under the Act for the capitalisation grant. To what extent will the capitalisation grant be built into the value of the total plant plus equipment, goodwill et cetera which is taken into account in the final figure which is negotiated by the owners of an existing plant and the foreign interests which may be coming in at the same time?</PARA>
<PARA> These are issues which are of concern to the industry. As I said, the industry says it supports this approach. It clearly does have built-in advantages to be able to say to people, `you may capitalise your expected grants over five years' of course, on the presumption that they will still be operating over that period of time. This is a matter which I think we have raised in our amendment, because it is one of the question marks in this legislation as it currently stands to which I trust the Minister will refer. </PARA>
<PARA> We see these changes as significant. We see the concept of capitalisation as an interesting additive to the debate on the capacity and benefits of tariffs, bounties and so forth, although as I said earlier, our objective is to phase them out as soon as possible, in terms of economic realities. Therefore, the issues which I put to the Minister, apart from those contained in our second reading amendment, are: to what extent is it the intention of the Government to extend the capitalisation concept to other industries which may be the recipients of tariffs or bounties, and is this to be limited exclusively to the bounty on textile yarn, or will it be extended further?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill is welcome as a measure which will facilitate restructuring in what continues to be one of the most heavily protected sections of Australian manufacturing. The Bill flows from the Government's review of the textile yarn bounty administration under the textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) plan for the reduction of assistance to these industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The average effective rates of assistance enjoyed by the textile yarns industry currently range from 67 per cent to 104 per cent. This level of assistance is far higher than that available to most industries in the manufacturing sector and second only to the clothing and footwear industries as the most heavily protected Australian manufacturing industry. This is salutary when one remembers that manufacturing is the most heavily protected sector of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounties paid to the yarn industry under the textile, clothing and footwear industry plan are currently set at about 40 per cent of the value added. Projected expenditure for 1989-90 under the existing arrangement is $91m. This assistance, along with various TCF import restrictions, is responsible for the high costs faced by household and commercial users of textiles in Australia. These costs represent the inefficiency of an industry which has been living, like many others, at the expense of Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The textile yarns bounty must be seen in the context of the entire textile, clothing and footwear industries and the Government's TCF plan, the broad thrust of which the Opposition supports. Like the Government, the coalition is committed to sustained reductions in assistance to the TCF industries with a view to making them internationally competitive and an important contributor to value added production in Australia. We welcome any measure intended to relieve the taxpayer of bounty payments and relieve, in turn, consumers of the high prices for inefficiently produced goods. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has had objection to the Government's administration of this plan. In particular, we oppose the unnecessary establishment of yet another statutory authority-the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA) to preside over the plan. We have objected to that authority's intrusive powers over management as indicative of the Government's corporate approach to industry policy. In the case of this Bill the TCFDA will be responsible for approving the business plan required of those enterprises seeking capitalisation grants. This plan will involve the firm seeking grants supplying detailed information to the authority about its proposed use of up-front payments of capital. This raises the important question of how a statutory authority can be expected to appraise accurately the financial position and market situation facing each firm. </PARA>
<PARA> This task is daunting enough for the entrepreneur with a financial stake in the matter let alone for a Canberra bureaucrat far removed from the day-to-day operations of the business. Yet any assessment of the financial viability of the proposed business plan under this legislation will depend on just such an appraisal. </PARA>
<PARA> Inevitably, approval for these capitalisation grants will entail the dubious exercise of picking winners on the part of the TCFDA bureaucracy. Whether or not this will be done effectively remains to be seen. Obviously a decision by some authority is required in the administration of these grants. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce could, if adequately resourced, provide the services currently being provided by the TCFDA without the need for the additional bureaucracy represented by the Authority. It was for reasons such as this that the coalition opposed the establishment of the TCFDA. It may even be the case that the Department is better qualified to perform this task, given its former institutional responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The capitalisation agreements foreshadowed by this legislation will be subject to terms and conditions imposed by the Minister of the day in the case of each grant. Such terms and conditions will no doubt be designed to protect taxpayers' money from abuse. This requirement is clearly necessary, although it will do little to protect the revenue where firms which are the recipients of the capitalisation grant eventually go bankrupt. However, we need to be wary of attempts by government to use the necessary accountability to the taxpayer to interfere excessively in the decisions of management. A balance is required. </PARA>
<PARA> The TCFDA already has wide discretionary powers in allocating assistance on the basis of its own determination of labour management plans, production costs, productivity changes, and the like. These powers are backed up by considerable powers of investigation and review, and with associated penalties for non-compliance. The wide scope for government interference can be counterproductive if used overzealously. There is no chance that ever-changing market signals will remain in accord with the decrees of a statutory authority for any length of time. How the TCFDA will reconcile this conflict is an interesting question. The answer in due course will tell us much about the difficulties faced by these industries. It will remain the case that the market will continue to be the best regulator of business decision making. The Government will best facilitate restructuring in the domestic textile yarns industry by exposing it to greater international competition through the textiles, clothing and footwear plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite these reservations about the conduct of Government industry policy, the coalition recognises that consistency is an important principle in the reduction of industry assistance. Producers need to be able to proceed on the basis that current investment decisions will not be undermined by the actions of future governments. Accordingly, a future coalition government can be expected to continue with the substance of any devolution in assistance arrangements set in train by this Government. We would not seek to exceed those arrangements, except where economic circumstances were then judged to permit further reform and competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The TCF plan provides for significant reductions, after some initial increases, in the levels of assistance for textiles, clothing and footwear industries. These reductions should bring about the desired level of restructuring over the life of the plan. However, we should remain alert to the scope for introducing further competition where firms successfully grapple with the opportunities created by restructuring and rationalisation. Already, there is evidence that some firms are doing well under the plan and making good use of available opportunities. Of course, there are other firms that will not do as well. That is the nature of business generally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the absolute level of TCF assistance that gives proper cause for reform. As the 1988-89 Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) annual report noted, it is the great differences in the levels of assistance within and between the textiles and other industries that leads to gross misallocations of resources, away from their most productive use. While there have been significant reductions in Government assistance to the manufacturing sector in recent years, there are still great variations in the levels of assistance provided to different industries, and these need to be evened out to encourage efficient resources use. That IAC annual report also noted that, were the agricultural and manufacturing assistance arrangements that are expected to be in place in the mid-1990s removed, Australia's gross domestic product could increase by nearly $4 billion per annum. Clearly, the scope for and potential benefits from further reform in industry policy are immense. It is to be hoped that many firms in the textiles industry will take up the opportunity of these up-front capitalisation grants to comprehensively restructure and rationalise their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Such restructuring will complement the liberalised import arrangements under the TCF plan that will increasingly subject the textiles industries to international competition. It is this competition which will provide for the significant improvements in efficiency that are necessary to bring down TCF prices, for the benefit of consumers. It is competition that will ultimately deliver us an efficient textiles industry. </PARA>
<PARA> So-called positive assistance arrangements such as those provided for in this Bill should be seen in this light. The capitalisation grants provided for under this Bill should be used by the textile yarns industry not simply to adjust to the phased reduction of bounty rates provided for under the TCF plan but, more importantly, to lay the foundations for the abolition of these bounty arrangements after the expiry of the TCF plan in June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> Micro-economic reform is firmly on the agenda-to use the buzz words of today-of both the Government and the Opposition. There is increasing international pressure for openness in trade policy through the current round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks. In the light of this agenda, those firms forgoing the textile yarn bounties in favour of capitalisation grants would be wise to use these grants to the greatest possible extent in anticipation of little or no assistance in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks, I now address the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. In concluding my remarks, I think it is important to state again that, through our second reading amendment, we seek to ensure that the making of a capitalisation grant to a textile yarn producer is limited to the expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker made his intention and meaning quite clear. He said that the Government was prepared to amend, in committee or at a later stage, its own legislation to prevent double dipping. In the case of Commonwealth funding being made available and then lost-for example, in the case of a textile yarn producer being declared bankrupt-any subsequent owner of the productive capacity should not be eligible for payment of bounty. That, of course, is intended to prevent double dipping. It might suit the convenience of the House if I conclude my remarks there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank honourable members for their contribution to the second reading debate. Honourable members raised several points on the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Bill 1990 on which they have sought some formal confirmation by the Government. Firstly, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) sought confirmation that this proposal for capitalisation does not contravene our General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) obligations. I confirm that. The bounty capitalisation scheme as proposed by the Bill is not a breach of Australia's GATT or closer economic relations obligations. There will be no impact on international trade obligations as this program is simply a refinement of the existing scheme which pays bounty on domestic production and domestic end use of textile yarns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a quantum of the capitalisation grant itself is dependent on, and must not be less than, a producer's current bounty entitlement under the Act-proposed new paragraph 21c (2) (a)-and as a producer's bounty entitlement is not measured in terms of export production, the capitalisation scheme itself has no direct implications for specific exports. As such, the grants are not in any way prescribed by the GATT or the GATT subsidies code. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker, together with the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), also sought confirmation that the proposed scheme cannot be used as start up capital or money which is calculated on possible bounty receipts or future expectations as opposed to current entitlement. I again confirm that this is so. Application for capitalisation grant is open to any person who is, or who is likely to become, a producer of bountiable yarn in Australia during the bounty period. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is acknowledged that eligibility to apply for a grant is not restricted to current producers of bountiable yarn, the proposed Bill, in the opinion of the Government's advisers and consistent with the Government's stated policy, expressly requires a grant to be made to a producer. The quantum with a capitalisation grant is dependent on, and must be less than, a producer's bounty entitlement under the Act, which is determined without the benefit of a capitalisation grant. Thus, a current producer cannot calculate the grant sought on the basis of what he might produce once he receives the money. While information concerning the purpose of the grant is indeed required both to cost and condition the grant, the ceiling on the quantum of a possible grant is dependent solely on one's bounty entitlement had the person continued to claim bounty without the benefits of a capitalisation grant-proposed paragraph 21c (2) (a). </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the new player, while he may apply for a grant-proposed new section 21a-cannot receive one until he becomes a producer and claims bounty under the Act. Again, the recommendation for a capitalisation grant is contingent, among other things, on there being a budgetary saving to the Commonwealth-that is, the grant sought must, in the opinion of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA), which has responsibility for the processing of grant applications, be likely to result in a lesser budgetary outlay by the Commonwealth, on a net present value basis, then the outlay required if the applicant had continued to claim a bounty in respect of bountiable yarn produced without the benefits of a capitalisation grant. </PARA>
<PARA> Where one has no entitlement under the Act, the Authority cannot satisfy itself as required in proposed new section 21c (2) (a) that, but for the grant, the applicant would have to continue to claim bounty and the bounty claims would have exceeded the amount proposed for the grant. In summary, therefore, the making of a capitalisation grant to a textile yarn producer is limited to expected bounty receipts in respect of existing capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable members asked whether guidelines are being prepared to assist applicants. I would point out that the legislation provides for expressed guidance for potential applicants in the type of information required to support an application. For example, proposed section 21b outlines what applications must contain with specific references to a business plan. I would expect the TCFDA would help firms develop their applications and, where necessary, develop literature to assist applicants. However, this must not be seen as additional to that which the legislation expressly requires. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield also asked generally whether the Government would apply bounty capitalisation to other bounty schemes. There have been no decisions to extend bounty capitalisation to other bounty schemes and I am not aware of any plans to do so. However, the option of capitalisation would undoubtedly be considered, especially if this scheme proves successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable members for Barker and Bradfield also sought the Government's assurance that all applicants would be dealt with fairly and that there would be even-handed treatment for all applications. The basis for assessing a capitalisation grant is indicated in the legislation. All applications for capitalisation grants will be directed to the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority, an independent authority responsible for administering the TCF plan-proposed paragraph 21b (1) (b). Proposed subsection 21b of the legislation sets out the nature of the application that is required, including a business plan. The Authority, in considering the application, must have regard to proposed section 21c of the legislation. In assessing the application, the Authority may, if it considers it necessary, refer the business plan to a suitably qualified person for the assessment of the plan's financial viability-proposed new section 21d. </PARA>
<PARA> The TCFDA must consider each application as soon as practicable after receipt and must report to the Minister on all applications for capitalisation grants-proposed section 21c (1). The decision of the Minister on the grant must be conveyed to the applicant, including the recommendation of the TCFDA and its reasons-proposed section 21e (1) and (3)-and must be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, proposed section 21g (1) and (2). </PARA>
<PARA> The assessment and recommendatory process will be highly transparent and provide applicants with an opportunity to consider the success or otherwise of their own and other applications for capitalisation grants. Further, given the facility for public scrutiny of this process, all applicants should be assured of timely and equitable treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, all Opposition members who spoke in the debate raised concerns about double dipping. The assurance sought concerning a control on double dipping, via sale perhaps, or bankruptcy, is in fact the subject of the Government's proposed amendment in the committee stage. Once a grant is taken, there will be no further entitlement to a bounty by the grant recipient, and any subsequent purchaser of the assets the subject of the grant will not be able to claim bounty on production generated by these assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The capitalisation proposal in this Bill gives persons the alternative of continuing under the present bounty assistance arrangements or opting for a one-off up-front grant. Recipients of capitalisation grants will be disqualified from future yarn bounty entitlements-proposed section 21h. In such cases, those persons will operate without tariff and bounty assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, via the amendment which is to be moved in the committee stage, bounty entitlement is to be denied anyone on the production of particular textile yarns from assets which are identified as essential to achieving the nominated objectives of a grant recipient's business plan. As implementation of the plan is the purpose of the grant, the additional disentitlement will ensure that the benefits of capitalisation in terms of budgetary savings from bounty forgone are not lost to the Commonwealth simply because essential production capacity of one the subject of a grant is sold or otherwise transferred to another who is not-proposed new section 5 (5) (ba) contained in amendment No. 1 of the Government's proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like at this point to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of the honourable member for Barker who has taken the opportunity to have a number of briefings with officers of the Australian Customs Service. The Government's amendments arise out of those discussions. I think they have been fruitful discussions and I hope that this Bill now meets all people's requirements. </PARA>

<PARA> ``(db) to establish and maintain an identified assets register in accordance with section 21fa of the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Act 1981;''. </PARA>
<PARA>Although this Bill was introduced into the Parliament only last week, in fact the proposed Bill was the subject of several briefings with the Opposition in the week prior to that, in particular, with the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the shadow Minister for industry and commerce. As a result of those briefings, the Government has accepted the concern expressed by the Opposition that the Bill does not completely protect the Commonwealth from the possibility of having to outlay money for a capitalisation grant, and then, subsequently, having to outlay additional money for a legitimate bounty claim in respect of bountiable production for that which the grant was meant to disentitle. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in the second reading speech on this Bill, the capitalisation grant scheme is predicated on the basis that capitalisation of bounty will exclude from bounty entitlement not only a person who capitalises a bounty entitlement, but also any subsequent purchaser of the capitalised business. The object of such a disentitlement is to clearly ensure that the benefits of capitalisation in terms of budgetary savings from bounty forgone are not lost to the Commonwealth simply because production by one person is taken over by another, or because production capacity of one the subject of a grant is merely sold to another who is not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill as introduced attempted to achieve the objective of protecting the Commonwealth's bounty saving by focusing on identified essential assets, that is, assets which are essential to achieving the nominated objectives of the business plan, the implementation of which was the purpose of the grant. The Bill in proposed section 21f forbids dealing with the identified assets without ministerial approval. Breach of that prohibition renders the capitalisation grant repayable in full. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the point which the Opposition has raised on this provision that if the original grant recipient gets into serious financial trouble and sells some or all of the identified essential assets, the Commonwealth's right of recovery of the capitalisation grant might, in fact, be worth very little. Accordingly, it is proposed by these amendments that the ministerial control over the identified essential assets be strengthened by an additional provision denying bounty entitlement to anyone who uses such an identified asset to produce textile yarn. For this purpose it is proposed that a public register of identified assets be created and maintained by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority as part of its administrative functions under the capitalisation grants scheme, to which proposed amendments (2) and (3) refer, and that the bounty eligibility provision in section 5 of the Act be amended to exclude a producer from entitlement to receive a payment of bounty in respect of bountiable yarn produced using such assets, to which amendment (1) refers. I commend the amend-ment to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We raised three concerns from our side of the House. The Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has dealt with one of those; that is, the matter of double dipping. It seems to me that the proposed amendments satisfactorily deal with those problems. I am grateful that he has seen fit to introduce them. The problem, as was raised with us and as has been pointed out, was that some assets, if they were not labelled, so to speak, could be used in the process of bounty capitalisation and then later on upon some receivership or other transfer be used again for further application. I think that that matter has now been dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>

Whilst we did not receive an amendment from the Minister on this subject we still have some doubt as to whether it is not possible to actually receive the grant as a new player.

Nevertheless, I understand that it is a difficult thing to do and we will be watching the operation of the legislation very carefully. </PARA>

I think I should repeat my question that I raised earlier to the Minister in the second reading debate so that he can indicate whether there are any such arrangements or understandings. If so, would he provide some details as to their nature?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the outlays mentioned by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) in introducing Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1989-90 was an amount of $23.5m. This was set aside to assist in the recovery of the tourist industry. I believe that the allocation is a recognition by this Government of the harm done to the tourist industry by the air pilots dispute which, I would suggest, was an unwarranted dispute. It also stresses that this Government recognises the need to particularly assist the States to try to recover their tourist industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The expenditure is part of a national strategy to accelerate the recovery of the vital foreign currency earning tourist industry. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1989-90 provides another $7.8m, and again this is mainly to assist tourism in the States. If those figures are added together, the total is $31.3m, which is a significant allocation to a particular industry across this nation, but it is warranted. It will be direct assistance in hard cash terms, and those people who have had a chance to talk to our entrepreneurs and State officials in the tourist industry would realise how important this expenditure will be. The allocation is understandable because of the broad and national economic importance of the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I took the time to extract some figures which highlight how important is this industry in dollar terms. In 1989 international tourism to Australia generated $6.1 billion-$6,000m-in foreign exchange earnings. It has become our nation's number one export earner, so its importance tends to rise up the scale in comparison. In 1988-89 tourism generated expenditure totalled $22.5 billion, and $15.3 billion of this amount can be attributed to domestic tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that last financial year the tourist industry contributed 5.6 per cent to gross domestic product. It is a major money earner for Australia, for regional Australia, and for every small locality in Australia that has something to sell in tourist terms. It is also a major employer. I point out that 5.8 per cent of the work force is found in the tourist industry, and that currently accounts for 442,000 jobs spread across Australia, not just in the capital cities or the major provincial cities but spread across Australia in every locality. It is an important generator of job positions. In 1988-89, 18,000 new jobs were created by tourism and, as honourable members would appreciate, particularly those who represent the provincial cities and country areas, it generates jobs in a very decentralised way. It is contributing to thousands of local economies across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that it does not matter where one lives in this country, some component of the local economy relates back to tourism. It is providing jobs for people from every working age group and from all the socioeconomic and educational levels. It creates jobs for those who are highly skilled and those who are under-skilled. It creates hundreds and thousands of associated jobs, not just in terms of the direct tourist industry, but also those that are ancillary to it, such as the service industries, parts and repairs industries, advertising, media, and food production. One could list item after item, category after category, where jobs have been created and are being created this very day. New jobs mean fewer unemployed Australians, greater productivity, and that, instead of drawing down on the welfare state of the nation, more people are contributing to the tax pool or tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that $2.7 billion came from the tourist industry in indirect taxes last financial year. In relation to the bricks and mortar investment, it has boosted the building and construction industry right across the nation. As at December 1989 the value of major tourist projects under construction or, one could add, the firmly committed projects, was worth $19.4 billion. It is interesting to note that this investment has increased by 0.5 per cent on the September 1989 figure. Perhaps 0.5 per cent does not sound much but, when one considers the impact of the pilots dispute and the sorts of things that were being said by the Opposition as to how the industry was being devastated because of the pilots dispute, 0.5 per cent is significant. </PARA>
<PARA> These are important statistics because they demonstrate the fact that tourism has an exciting future. As I said, it is an industry that was hurt severely by the pilots dispute, but it is quickly recovering. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures show that in comparison with January 1989 the number of short-term visitor arrivals in January 1989 in fact increased by 4 per cent. I was surprised when I read those figures because, with all the hype that had been going on, I thought there had been a devastation in the industry but, when one compares January to January, there has been a 4 per cent increase in short term visitor arrivals, which was mainly brought about by a significant increase from Asian countries such as Taiwan, where the number of short term visitors has increased by 191 per cent; from China, 157 per cent; from Hong Kong, 144 per cent; and from Singapore, 96 per cent. It is pleasing to note that Qantas Airways Ltd is expanding its interests in the areas of South East Asia and Asia generally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an encouraging story also from our traditional market of Japan where the increase was 29 per cent on January 1989. Again, I thought that the industry had been devastated but, again, when one looks at the figures comparing 1989 January date with 1990 January date, we have an increase, even from the traditional market of Japan, of almost 30 per cent. The pilots dispute caused a severe impact, but that impact is dissipating and I am confident that the decreases we experienced in visitors from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Europe, the United States of America (USA), Canada and New Zealand can be reversed. I am also confident that Australia will continue to grow in importance as an educational destination. Again comparing January 1989 to January 1990, there has been a 20 per cent increase in the use of Australia as an educational destination. </PARA>
<PARA> Another category that is worth looking at is business travel, which has also experienced an increase of 4 per cent, or a 4 per cent growth. The international fall that did take place from the areas I mentioned such as Europe and the USA I believe were offset by domestic tourist growth in many areas. Entrepreneurs in my own area were able to tell me how their numbers were up even during the pilots dispute. This came about mainly because people decided to drive rather than fly. They decided that they could travel within that eight hours or day's drive. That meant that they came to Central Queensland, the southern parts of the Great Barrier Reef, the Great Keppel Island regions, and the sapphire fields of central Queensland. I am told that the same thing occurred in many parts of Australia that were within eight hours of the capital and major provincial cities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think also that it is part of a new realisation among Australians that some great holidays are to be had in what we might term our own backyards. So, whilst we look at the negatives of the pilots dispute, we need to come back and weigh up the positives, which surely must first and foremost be that realisation that Australia is a magnificent, beautiful tourist destination which can be enjoyed just as much by Australians as by our overseas visitors, as welcome as they are. People have started to travel Australia and they are doing so more now, because, during that pilots dispute, they realised that it is worth going to those places. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89 Australian residents aged 14 and over undertook 46 million trips of at least one night's duration. That is slightly down on the previous year but, when one considers the fact that we had such a huge drop in flights, that is understandable. During this period there were 214 million nights away from home, which again is big dollar terms in the tourist industry. Considering the length of the pilots dispute, I suggest that there has been a minute decrease in trips and night stays. When one looks at those figures, one sees that they are down 1.3 per cent which, as I stress, is a minute decrease. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the January figures signal a positive boost for the tourist industry. The growth is encouraging and it is proper that the Government, this Hawke Government, is acting to build on the good year's start that we had in January, February and March. I certainly welcome the investment of the $31.3m that this Government has appropriated, mainly through the States, to boost the state industries. We need to take advantage of the new interest in Australia among Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few moments I have left I want to put forward five, I believe, basic recommendations that can assist. First and foremost we need to give greater emphasis to a regional approach to promotion. I argue that moneys need to be allocated for the Australian market and that this money be allocated on a regional promotional basis. We should experiment with regional super tourist destinations and, obviously, being a parochial person, I would argue that central Queensland, the land of Capricornia, is an ideal place to start. Those regions such as Capricornia need money to be given directly to their regionally based promotional groups. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we have a system whereby one must go through the States. I understand the issue of States rights and the importance of promoting an area on a State basis. Having been in the State Parliament, I also see the advantages of sometimes breaking expenditure down even on an more decentralised, parochial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> John Brown, a previous Minister for tourism, was prepared to pursue that concept following a conference he attended in Yeppoon in central Queensland. He was prepared to look at it for Tasmania and all places in central Queensland, but unfortunately nothing came of it at that time. Under previous governments in Queensland, the State approach meant that areas were left out. Regrettably, my area of Capricornia and central Queensland were certainly left out. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not so long ago, in 1988, that a brochure was produced in which it was claimed that Rockhampton was the gateway to Hamilton Island. Hamilton Island is a beautiful place and I recommend every person listening to this debate to go there, but I argue rather strongly that Rockhampton is not exactly the gateway to Hamilton Island. Mackay might be. Whilst we have Ansett Airlines flights going from Rockhampton to Hamilton Island, one still should not promote it as the gateway as such. In a similar vein, another brochure said that Brisbane was the gateway to the sapphire fields of central Queensland. Whoever prepared those promotions did not understand much about local geography. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to rely on the locals to work out the promotions. I argue that that can best be done if the promotional money-moneys needed for regional promotional material, for media advertising-is given to the local regional promotional organisations. I have advanced the idea, and I do it again tonight, that, if we were to give a quarter of a million dollar grant to central Queensland, this would readily be matched by the locals. It would be very good expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be matched by the regional bureaus, the chambers of commerce, the private entrepreneurs, the airlines, the carriers and the local governments-all of whom are interested in looking after their own. It could in fact double Federal government spending by taking a more regional approach. It would allow for local expertise in promotion. More importantly, it would assist the economies of regional Australia, and that is good for decentralisation and spreading out jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> My second recommendation is that we ensure that the national and international promotions that take place incorporate places other than Sydney, the Gold Coast and Ayers Rock. I know that Sydney is a wonderful place, that Ayers Rock is unique and that the Gold Coast is a great place to go for a holiday, but they are not the only parts of Australia. When one looks at some of the promotional material, that is all one sees. That is where the Japanese want to go and that is what the Americans hear about. We need to give greater emphasis to the magnificent tourist destinations that exist in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My third point is that, in terms of attracting tourists, we need to target Asia. There are 176 million Indonesians and 17 million Malaysians who, I am told, have a higher annual income than Australians. There are some 3.5 million Singaporeans, many of who are very wealthy. I am told that some 20 million Indians receive incomes equal to $A50,000 per year. There would be much value in targeting these countries. In the last 12 months we have started to see the great increases in the number of people coming from these countries. But they need to feel wanted. They need to be encouraged. There needs to be a national and coordinated State campaign into Asia and South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> My next point relates to the incentives for students to learn Asian languages. We need to have special Austudy allowances to encourage young people to undertake studies in other languages, particularly Indonesian, Japanese and other languages of Asia. We need to give assistance to teachers to undertake language studies and to upgrade their language skills. There ought to be courses. Having been an ex-teacher, I would argue that it ought to be compulsory for teachers to undertake a dual language course at teachers' college. We must have greater encouragement in the primary and secondary school fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was told that the Northern Territory has now introduced Indonesian into its primary schools. This is a wonderful thing. I know that many schools in Queensland are teaching Japanese at primary and secondary school levels. That is where we must start. We must get the young ones when they first enter school. It is important that we have this language objective, this language aim. Just as we are saying that we will have one billion trees planted in the next decade, we ought to have a target that a million Australians shall learn a second language by 1995 and three million by the turn of the twenty-first century. Again, I emphasise that those languages should centre on particularly Indonesian and Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> My final point in the few moments I have left relates to the cost of travel in this country. Not so long ago a staff member told me that it was cheaper for her to go to Fiji for seven days than it was to travel from Rockhampton to Cairns and spend a long weekend there. I realise that the deregulation of the airlines will change a lot of this, but we need to do far more. The airlines have to be encouraged to start to compete domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was in America last year I spoke to some of the Qantas Airways Ltd officials. They argued that the problem was that they could get the people to come to Australia because of our magnificent attractions but that when they got here the internal costs of travel were exorbitant. Again, we need to promote travel in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many Australians realise that one can get an all-around-Australia ticket. The airlines do not seem to promote it very well. But one can get a ticket that allows one to go virtually all around Australia as long as one keeps going in the one direction. We need to argue for cheaper fares. I pulled out some figures tonight and found that the cost of a Sydney to Perth trip was $528 but that Sydney to Fiji was $542. </PARA>
<PARA> I spoke to a parliamentary staffer tonight and was told that she is going to Hawaii on a seven-day, six-night trip with all accommodation included for $1,100. I doubt that one could go to Cairns for very long on that amount of money. There is a need to target the cost of domestic travel in this country. The responsibility must be picked up by the domestic airlines. But we, as a government, and the States must give encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I congratulate the Government for the energy that its Ministers have demonstrated in promoting Australian tourism. I particularly cite J. J. Brown for the work that he did, for the foundation that he established. I also congratulate Senator Graham Richardson for his endeavours during some difficult times. He was the relevant Minister during the pilots dispute. I am confident that the new Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) will continue the standard. We must constantly tell ourselves that there are dollars to be earned, that there are jobs to be created and that there is an international reputation to be established. We need to give the money where it is needed and where it will be best used-and that is certainly tourism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on Supply Bill (No. 1) 1990-91 I wish to draw the House's attention to the appropriation of $90.5m to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). Such a significant expenditure recognises that, even though we are faced with financially tough times, we are also faced with a dramatically rising crime rate and our society demands and needs a well funded police force. Decisions are, however, now being made which will lead to a further increase in this crime rate and which will make the current allocation of moneys totally inadequate. I am referring to the proposed establishment of a casino in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps lured by the prospect of easy money, many have forgotten the problems associated with such establishments and have concentrated on the pot of gold, which they mistakenly believe will be there for the taking. Mr Brian Bates, the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the ACT region of the Australian Federal Police, summed up the dangers of the proposed Canberra casino in the select committee on the casino inquiry held by the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in July 1989. Mr Bates said:</PARA>
<PARA> The AFP believes that the proposal to operate a casino in Canberra presents a potential for increase in criminal acts in this Territory. For example, it may be expected that there will be an increase in prostitution to cater for a certain element of the anticipated clientele. There may be an influx of professional gamblers, cheats and interstate criminals and their associates, and that premises are likely to be used as a money-laundering facility. </PARA>
<PARA> The AFP would also expect to be consulted on the developers' and licensees' suitability before approval is given as well as on the suitability of all persons under contract who are not directly involved in running the casino. In addition to sophisticated internal security which will no doubt be installed, adequate police contingency plans will be required to counter and react to large-scale armed holdup activity. There will be a continuing role for police in assisting the proper monitoring of employees and managerial appointments. All this will require the provision of additional AFP manpower. Accordingly, it is the AFP's view that if the community wants a casino, then that community needs to be aware of the potential for the further development of already existing problems such as prostitution, alcohol, drug abuse, general street offences, misbehaviour types of offences, assaults and robberies and thefts. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Lloyd Worthy, the Commander of the Australian Capital Territory Crime Division, ACT region, in this same select committee estimated that it would cost approximately $5m per annum to police the casino development. That is an extra $5m of taxpayers' money that will need to be allocated to the AFP's appropriation should the proposed casino get off the ground. Regrettably, there was little done at that time to bring these and other AFP concerns about the proposed casino to the attention of the Canberra community. </PARA>
<PARA> The American study entitled `Casino Gambling as a Growth Pole Strategy and its Effect on Crime' published in the Journal of Regional Science in 1989, I believe, supports the AFP statements. The study highlights the fact that crimes in Atlantic City, New Jersey, were running at 100.6 per 1,000 people in 1977 when the casinos commenced operation. In 1984 the figure had increased to 353.7 per 1,000 people. It should be noted that for the same period the average rate in the State of New Jersey fell from 50.9 to 48.4 crimes per 1,000 people, providing a most disturbing contrast. Sadly, Atlantic City now has one of the highest crime rates in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cain Labor Government in my own State of Victoria has publicly stated that it will not allow casinos to open in that state. It has opted instead for a form of gambling called the tabaret. The first of what will be many such ventures is due to open later this year based in the hotel complex of the Menzies at Rialto. The gambling facilities will be controlled by the Victorian Totalisator Agency Board (TAB), with the food and drink provided by Federal Hotels which, of course, already has its Australian headquarters conveniently located at the hotel. The gambling will be via 220 computerised video gaming machines which will be operated by the customer inserting a pre-paid plastic card similar to the credit card into the device. This allows the player to win money on video games such as golf, football, basketball and racing. For instance, in the football game players can elect to kick a ball at the goal post. They bet on how close they will come to the goal once they have selected the distance and angle they will kick from. The video games will continue to operate for as long as the player's plastic card has a credit balance. The player can stop playing at any time, take his or her card to the cashier, and collect either winnings or the value of the unused portion of the card. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cain Labor Government has gone to great lengths to state that these machines are not poker machines, which Premier Cain will not permit in Victoria. The TAB's General Manager, Mr Bill Roffey, is quoted in the Sunday Age of 17 December 1989 as dismissing suggestions that the video machines are poker machines. Roffey claims that there are significant differences. Poker machines are developed around plums, cherries and spinning reels, whereas these machines are based upon a sequence in a game or sport. The only similarity is that in both games players have lost money. The only trouble with these statements is that they conflict with the findings of a 1983 State Government inquiry into poker machines. The inquiry, entitled `Board of Inquiry Into Poker Machines' and chaired by Mr Murray Wilcox, QC, arrived at a number of important conclusions. In section 2.21, entitled `The Future-Video Games', Mr Wilcox says in part:</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear from a technological point of view that microprocessor technology is readily available to design a multiplicity of slot machine games using video screens instead of spinning reels. Indeed there are already available `poker machines' which, instead of using spinning mechanical reels, display simulated spinning reels on a colour video machine . . . It is a short step from there to machines which play various other games upon the insertion of a coin either with or without the subsequent manipulation of a handle. </PARA>
<PARA>Wilcox suggests a statutory definition of a poker machine in section 2.36 of this report, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>`Gaming machine' means any machine, device or contrivance, the operation of which determines the outcome of a game of chance or skill and chance played for money or money's worth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Wilcox definition seems to describe more than adequately the tabaret's video machines. The Cain Government has therefore quietly overturned the findings of this report in a very neat exercise of gross duplicity. All new legislation in Victoria impacting substantially on the community is required to have an environmental impact statement before it is passed. The Cain Government, when it decided that video machines were not really poker machines, found it could use the Racing Act of 1958-specifically division V, part V-to introduce tabarets. As it is existing legislation, the Cain Government will not be required to conduct an environmental impact statement or, for that matter, any other form of in-depth inquiry. Perhaps Mr Cain and his Ministers need to be reminded of the social impact Wilcox believed such gambling would have on the community. In his words, it is a:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . certainty that some Victorians will use the machines to gamble to an extent which is beyond their financial capacity and that many will gamble to an extent which causes them serious concern. Some of these persons may, in any event and by other means, gamble excessively but, for most, the critical factors would be the nature and availability of poker machines. The proportion of all Victorians who would gamble excessively upon poker machines would be extremely small, but the effect upon some of these individuals and their families would be catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA>As the centres will be opened under the Racing Act of 1958 there will again be no environmental impact statement required. Mr Cain's duplicity is compounded even further. </PARA>
<PARA> As with all Cain Government forays into commerce, there seems to be little precision about the costs and expected returns of the project. Premier Cain announced on 8 December 1987 that the total cost of the Tabaret project will be $14m, including the cost of providing the high technology equipment and the alterations and refurbishment required to the premises. Mr Cain stated there would be no cost to the taxpayer. In 1990 the Victorian Auditor-General found that the Tabaret's capital costs were almost $20m and he expected the project to cost $25m by the time it opened-a sum vastly different from Mr Cain's $14m. Premier Cain announced in 1987 that he expected the revenue from the city Tabaret in the first year to be $60m. The then Chairman of the TAB, Mr Rob Nordlinger, estimated the Tabaret's turnover in the first year at $72m. The most interesting figure is, however, the one given by the man credited with the Tabaret idea, Mr Steve Crabb, at that stage the Labour Minister in the Cain Government. Mr Crabb is reported in the Melbourne Sun of 20 July 1987 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It is believed the new sports betting complex could bring in up to $150m a year, an optimistic figure quoted by Labour Minister Mr Crabb based on estimated gambling from a fully-fledged casino. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crabb's estimate, which differs enormously from that of Mr Cain and Mr Nordlinger, gives rise to several questions: Firstly, if the Tabaret is not a casino, why the decision to base potential revenue on that of a casino? Secondly, does this mean a study has been conducted into the potential for a casino in Victoria? Thirdly, if such a study exists, when was it done, who conducted it, who commissioned it, and where is it?</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to an article in the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 7 May 1990, headed `Family Philanthropic to Tal Investors'. The article states that Tal Holdings, a company which is controlled by Mr Greg Farell, who is also the Chairman of Tal's subsidiary, Federal Hotels, has stated it will become the operator of at least two, and possibly three, additional casinos in the future. One of these two or three extra casinos would probably be the strange casino project approved by the Hawke Labor Government for Christmas Island. Where are the others to be? Is it possible that the Cain Government is considering converting the tabaret in the future to a fully fledged high technology casino and Federal Hotels perceive this as an addition to its stable in one form or another? Returning momentarily to the Canberra situation, does this also mean that Federal Hotels, which has tendered for the proposed casino, has already been given the nod even before tenders have been properly evaluated? It certainly is an interesting question as to where these additional casinos will ultimately eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA> In discussing the Victorian tabaret, it is important to note another of the findings of the Wilcox report, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA>[ . . . there is . . .] the certainty of increased criminal activity in Victoria as a direct result of the introduction of poker machines. The extent of the likely increase depends upon two factors: the number of premises in which the machines are permitted-</PARA>
<PARA>and of course the Victorian Government is planning on having a large number of tabarets-</PARA>
<PARA>and the stringency of the controls imposed. Depending on these factors crime will increase to a degree ranging from significant to serious. There is not merely a risk of increased crime. Under any scenarios crime will increase. </PARA>
<PARA>The tabarets are not yet open for business but the criminal element has already emerged in respect of poker machines in Victoria. I am advised that the firm Olympic Video Gaming Pty Ltd was given ministerial approval in late 1987 to manufacture video amusement and poker machines in Victoria. Olympic has lobbied for the introduction of its poker machines into AFL football clubs in Victoria and at one point had a similar interest in respect of the Tabaret. The firm is also now in the process of commencing operations in Queensland and yet the following facts should have caused Premier Cain to pause before the approval was granted and for the Goss Labor Government in Queensland to exercise caution about Olympic. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nick Balagiannis, managing director of Olympic Video Gaming Pty Ltd, has, among many other interesting things, convictions in the Melbourne magistrates court during 1986 for: smuggling, producing untrue documents and making false statements, with these convictions all relating to gaming machines. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it is my belief that the proposed introduction of the casino in Canberra and the opening of the tabaret in Melbourne will be at a great social cost to these respective communities. Premier Cain, by seeking to introduce the tabarets in Victoria without full and proper public consideration and in such an underhand manner, is doing a disservice to all Victorians and needs to be brought to task for his actions. He also has certain compelling questions to answer about the Tabaret, its intended future nature and the peculiar approval given to Olympic to manufacture in Victoria. I seek leave to table copies of various conviction orders recorded against Mr Balagiannis. </PARA>

<PARA> At the last election the Illawarra region once more returned four Labor members. This was not only a reflection on the very strong representation by the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) and-dare I say it-the honourable member for Throsby, who have given so much to the people of the region, but also it reflected the realisation by the people of the Illawarra that if our conservative opponents were elected to office the people of the Illawarra would receive an extra dose of what we in the Illawarra have come to call Greinerism. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be familiar with the Illawarra area, your electorate being quite close to it. No area in Australia has been singled out for more savage treatment by any government than the Illawarra has received at the hands of the New South Wales Government. There is a long list of closures of government services in the area. The Greiner Government selects an area, such as the Illawarra Welfare Rights Service of the Illawarra Legal Resource Centre, and decides without consultation or notification to close the Service in the expectation that the Federal Government will pick up the funding. The State Government has done this repeatedly with State services, services that are the responsibility of the States to fund and, indeed, services that the States in the past have always agreed to fund. There is a whole list of such services: child-care services, legal rights services, workers' health services and women's centres. The States have agreed to consultation with the Federal Government to pick up the funding for these services and now, often in the middle of a financial year, the State withdraws funding and expects or demands that the Federal Government pick up the tab. </PARA>
<PARA> The very latest example of this, which affects not only the Illawarra but the whole State of New South Wales, is the teachers' pay issue. The teachers have put in a very justifiable claim. The New South Wales Education Minister has offered a slight pay increase but the expectation is that the Federal Government will pick up the tab for the funding. This is out- rageous. No-one argues more strongly than I that the teachers have a justifiable claim but if the Federal Government funds the differential in teachers' pay what will stop all government employees demanding-and rightly-the same? The nurses, the police and the firemen, if the Federal Government steps in and makes up the difference between what the State Government has offered and what the teachers are demanding, will demand the same. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only through this lack of funding that the Greiner Government is attempting to punish the people of the Illawarra. Over the past few years the Port Kembla Harbour Task Force has worked tirelessly to re-invigorate the Port of Kembla so it can take its place as an export development port. In this regard it has worked very closely with the farmers of the central west, especially in the Eugowra area. It is a project that has the full support of the Illawarra population. It was successful in getting the new grain terminal for Port Kembla. We hope that the New South Wales Government does not sell it off, as it has recently sold off the coal loader, which the Federal Government put $20m into. We also put $18.7m into the grain terminal. If the State Government attempts to sell off that grain terminal, I for one will be asking for that Federal money to be returned to the people of the Illawarra so that we can spend it on other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing stopping the port from reaching its full potential is the lack of adequate transport infrastructure. One of the first acts of vandalism of the Greiner Government when it came to power was to cease work on the Maldon-Dombarton rail link at the very time when, at long last, people were starting to realise the importance of rail. </PARA>
<PARA> As if this were not enough, the New South Wales Greiner Government refuses to nominate a replacement road for the notorious Macquarie pass for funding under the Federal Government's national arterial road program and even the recently announced rural and provincial cities program. If it nominated we could have a replacement road built there within 18 months which would contribute greatly to the development of the port of Kembla as an export port. I was delighted today, as I know the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) would have been delighted, with the announcement regarding funding for the Pacific Highway, for which the honourable member has long campaigned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that transport will take a high profile during this session. That was one of the reasons I was so anxious to get on to some of the transport committees with my good friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who has done sterling work in this regard. I suspect that during this parliamentary session rail will come into its own, which is a long overdue step. It is a great pity that, as I said before, the Greiner Government, as one of its first acts of vandalism, cut the Maldon-Dombarton link. </PARA>
<PARA> Rail is the cheapest and most effective way of transporting freight on long deliveries. The Hume Highway runs through my electorate and, along with the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) and other honourable members, I am horrified at the trucks trundling along it every day. These trucks go through places like Goulburn and Mittagong, trucks carrying freight that really should be and could be on rail. Sometimes when I see all these trucks going up and down the Hume Highway I have the nightmarish feeling that maybe they are loaded with exactly the same commodity, with one lot of the commodity going from Sydney to Melbourne and the other lot going from Melbourne to Sydney, trucks carrying exactly the same commodity and passing on the way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that governments of all political persuasions-from my side of the House or from the other side of the House-both State and Federal, have neglected rail for far too long. They are all guilty of letting the rail services in this country decline and now, as a result, all these trucks are on the roads, cutting them to pieces. The Government has been criticised very strongly by the honourable member for Cowper, and other members, of course, for not putting more money into roads. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says quite rightly, but I suggest, with the greatest respect, that if we could take some of those trucks of the road-I am not saying all trucks, because there will always be a place for trucks on the road-and put some of that freight on to rail, where it rightly belongs, the money that is being used mainly to repair the damage done to roads by trucks could be used to build new roads. Of course, there will always be a debate about whether the Government is spending enough money on the roads or whether more should be spent, and the point of view always depends on which side of the House one sits on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The money that is being put into the roads today is mainly being used to repair the damage that the trucks are doing to our roads. What we need in this country is new roads and better roads. A truck does one thousand times more damage to the roads than the ordinary motorist does. </PARA>
<PARA> All motorists are subsidising the heavy freight industry in Australia. As I have said before, my brother is a truckie and my father had a truck transporting business for many years. If the road freight industry paid the real cost of transporting that freight by road, there would be absolutely no argument about which form of transport is the cheaper; of course, it would be rail. A rail network is in place all round Australia and governments should be putting a lot more money back into rail. Last year I served on a committee that was looking at the east-west freight corridor and the idea of transporting freight across Australia by rail. Another thing that governments must consider is a completely integrated transport network. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot understand why at the moment Australia's major ports are stuck in the middle of the nation's largest cities. It seems to me absolutely ludicrous that we are taking container ships into Glebe, an inner suburb of Sydney, and the container terminal at Port Botany. The result is that freight such as wool and hides is trundled from Yennora across the city to Botany. It is ridiculous to do that. We should be doing what has been done in some European countries, where they have established completely new ports. </PARA>
<PARA> One place where this has been done is Port Kembla, although it is not a new port. If we could develop Port Kembla as a roll-on roll-off container port, with adequate road and rail networks to that port, we could forget the business of taking containers to Sydney. At present a lot of freight from Port Kembla is taken by road to Sydney and then exported by sea and incoming freight comes by sea to Sydney and is then trucked down the highway to Port Kembla. In my view, that is absolute stupidity . </PARA>
<PARA> We should have an adequate transport infrastructure, which would involve rail taking its rightful place as the premier way of transporting heavy freight over long distances. That is what I am talking about. I am not talking about short haul deliveries. I am not saying that there is no place for road haulage. Of course, there will always be a place for trucks on our roads. But I think all governments have allowed rail to decline far too much and I am pleased to perceive ever so slightly a realisation in this Parliament that rail must come back into its own. It is my hope that rail will have its rightful place as the premier way of transporting heavy freight over long distances in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I agree with a fair amount of what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has been saying; in particular, I agree with him when he says that there will be an increasing emphasis on transport in this Parliament. I believe he is absolutely right. I, of course, as you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker and other honourable members know, have been for five years or more advocating the upgrading of the Pacific Highway to a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway. So far as I am concerned, today is an historic day, because there has been a bipartisan agreement between the Federal Minister for Land Transport, (Mr Robert Brown), and the New South Wales Minister for Transport, the Hon. Bruce Baird. It is a very significant day indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have been campaigning for for more than five years is to have the concept accepted that the Pacific Highway between Hexham and the Queensland border must be a four-lane dual carriageway divided highway for the benefit of all Australians-not just for the people of northern New South Wales. It is the premier link on the east coast of Australia. It is significant that only last week I presented petitions to this Parliament with 45,454 signatures, asking this Parliament and the Government to provide more funding. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I am absolutely delighted that we have reached this historic occasion today. It is historic because, if you look at what the Opposition-the coalition parties-tried to do and the policies we advocated in the last and the most recent election campaign, we said that we would be prepared in conjunction with New South Wales to provide $1.2 billion over the next 10 years to upgrade the Pacific Highway. By the announcement put out today by the State and Federal Ministers, an amount of $1 billion has been promised over the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> So you might understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it is with a great deal of joy that I stand here, seeing that not only my efforts, but also those of many people on the north coast of New South Wales, my parliamentary colleagues from the region, the former members for Richmond and Page and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) all working with me, have achieved this result. It is a great result that has come out of those efforts and I pay tribute to all the people on the north coast of New South Wales who have supported me in this campaign. It has been an Australia-wide campaign. The 45,454 signatures on the petitions presented last week were not only from people on the north coast, but from people all over Australia. They included the signatures of people from Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Tasmania and everywhere else. Unfortunately, those people became aware of the shortcomings of that highway because of the two disastrous, horrendous bus crashes involving the deaths of 55 people last year. The signatories had the breadth of feeling and the ability to see that the Pacific Highway deserved to be a national priority. </PARA>
<PARA> So today we have the announcement by the Federal Minister and the State Minister of a $120m boost in funds for the Pacific Highway over the next three years. Under this agreement a total of $300m will be spent over the next three years, compared with $115m in the previous three years. At that rate of funding, $1 billion will be provided for the Pacific Highway over the next 10 years. I compliment both Ministers-the Federal Minister and the State Minister, the Hon. Bruce Baird-on coming to this agreement for the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly delighted that the media release put out today by the Federal and State Ministers acknowledges that the ultimate long term aim is to provide that four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway all the way to the Queensland border. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we are discussing the Appropriation and Supply Bills. Listening to the debate I find there has not been a great deal of detail spoken about the Bills before the House. I would like to raise one or two points which I think are significant. I refer to the Department of Finance Information Paper and Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (No. 1) and (No. 2) of 1989-90. There are a few very interesting little points in it. </PARA>
<PARA> For instance, there was a total budget for legal aid initially of $3,550,000, but there will be a saving of $300,000 of that, which, I suppose, is a good thing when looked at in isolation. But the payments to the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory for the provision of legal aid was budgeted at $102,524,000, and there will be a saving of $6,347,000. I suppose in these days when both sides of the political spectrum are saying, `Cut back on expenditure', one should applaud that. Yet I would like to look beyond the figures to the people. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the great shortcomings we have in this country is the affordability of recourse to the law for ordinary citizens. It seems to me that people have either to be very rich or very poor or they cannot go to the law about anything. If people are very rich and have the resources to pay for their own legal advice and go to court, that is fine. If they are very poor and qualify for legal aid-provided they meet the various requirements-they too can seek justice in the courts of this country. But I suggest that for people in the middle-people in our own situation-there is no way that they could afford to go to the Supreme Court over an issue. For instance, if somebody defamed me there is no way I could afford to seek justice. </PARA>
<PARA> This applies to so many people throughout this land. I believe this House, and the Parliament as a whole, should spend some time in just looking at the situation of legal representation so that people falling between the two stools of poverty and affluence can also manage to seek recourse to the law. </PARA>
<PARA> I also notice that in the area of social security an allocation of $5m was made for child care expenses for sole parents undergoing training. I think it is highly commendable. If we are the sort of society we like to think we are we should provide training for sole parents so that they can become self-sufficient. But that has been cut back by $3,800,000, so there is not a great deal going to happen in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The total budget for the Family Court of Australia of $38m-odd is being cut back by $542,000. Many of my constituents come into my office distressed by the actions of the Family Court. Perhaps we should be spending a great deal more in terms of family law and providing services for the people who are going to that Court. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also perturbed to look at the savings being made in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The sum of $3,293,800 was allocated for medical examinations, fares and expenses of veterans and dependants, and there will be a saving of $174,000 on that. Again, I think of the veterans who come to my office or phone who are concerned because they have difficulty in getting the travelling expenses and associated funding they need. Under Division 220 one sees the expenses for travelling for medical treatment are being cut by $218,000, and there is a saving of $500,000 on telephone rental concessions to pensioners. I really wonder whether that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to education. There is a total appropriation of $6,135,700 for grants for Aboriginal education-nobody in their right mind would deny the need for Aboriginal people in this country to receive every possible help they can get with education so they can take their place in our society as equal Australians, subject to the same provisions as anybody else. But we are cutting that by over $1m. I do not think that is satisfactory. I am reminded of the fallen Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), because I know that he, for one, has been such an advocate of the value of education and research if this country of ours is going to do what it should be doing and be competitive in the world. Here again $62m has been provided in appropriations for grants for research and higher education but it is being cut by $26m. Post-graduate students were allocated $29,600,000 and that is being cut by $15m-over 50 per cent. Where is the logic in cutting back on research and higher education?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Some $400 is being saved-I suppose a rather amusing amount-on the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. There is actually to be a saving of $100 for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation-Regional Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia, the Far East and the South West Pacific. It probably costs far more for printing than will actually be saved. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to go back to the point about the need for research and the need for investment in research and development. In the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce $700,000 was appropriated under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976-Project Grants, and that is cut by 50 per cent. </PARA>

Under the textiles, clothing and footwear industries development strategy, $1,500,000 was provided in the appropriations for the export development program. Does the House know what the saving is going to be? It is going to be $1,500,000.

One should bear in mind that this Government of ours that we have at present got about only 40 per cent of the primary votes, and was elected by the preference votes of the Australian Democrats, the Green candidates and all the conservation people. What is it doing about soil conservation? There is a Budget of $6,628,000 and a saving of $4,174,000. Over two-thirds of the money grandly allocated and announced at Budget time for soil conservation has been cut-saved-from the national soil conservation program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point in this area I would like to talk about is in the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Again, this comes back to the ordinary communities of Australia-the communities in the States and the Northern Territory. There is assistance for the development of community recreation and sporting facilities budgeted at $8,750,000. One can bet one's bottom dollar that the Minister at the time of announcing the appropriation said, `This is what we are doing for community recreation and sporting facilities'. That has been cut by $4.7m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, just an election gimmick. There was a 50 per cent cutback. Another gimmick on the part of the Government was the much vaunted plan of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to plant one billion trees in the next 10 years. We all know that the planting of 600 million of those billion trees was to involve nothing more than seeds being thrown out of the back of an aeroplane. That is some tree planting program! Only last week some of the members of the Australian-United States of America Parliamentary Group entertained to lunch the United States Secretary for Energy, Admiral James Watkins. He told us at lunch that President Bush has a program to plant one billion trees a year-but not involving tossing seed out of the back of a plane. This will have a budget of $US210m to back it up. That is what I call a tree planting program, where some money is put into backing up what is required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now refer to a questionnaire that I put out to my electorate of Cowper last November. I asked my constituents to advise me of their views on a number of issues. The most important part of the role of a member of parliament is not to stand up and speak here, as I and others are doing tonight, but to ask what the people one is representing think and to listen to what they say. Some 1,998 people responded to that questionnaire. Those very influential polls undertaken around Australia take about the same number of people all around Australia. While my questionnaire was not a statistically compiled survey, it certainly had some value and it evoked just on 2,000 responses. I do not have time to talk about every issue, but one of the questions was, `Should we have more foreign investment?'. There was a response of `Yes' from 682, or 34 per cent, of the respondents, and 1,315 people said no-about 66 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the question of foreign investment, we have to have a sensible and sensitive debate. I know that it is all too popular for some people to say that they do not want any more foreign investment. They do not realise, of course, the benefit to Australia. They also say that they do not want Japanese investment-because Japanese investment is the flavour of the month, or not, as the case may be. The reality is that probably the biggest investor in Australia is the United Kingdom, followed by the United States of America and then followed perhaps by Japan, with France, Germany and Holland following, more or less equally. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to this Parliament that to facilitate a rational, sensible and reasonable debate on foreign investment we should have a public inquiry, promoted by this Parliament, into just who owns Australia-because nobody knows who owns Australia. However, if we are going to have that rational, reasonable debate that I believe we should have, we should have a public inquiry so that it can be established who does own Australia. We would then have a basis on which to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to close by talking very briefly about education. I shall refer to one particular facet. I always knew it, but during the last election campaign it became very obvious indeed that by and large the people of Australia are not being educated to be citizens of Australia. We need to look at our education system so that when people leave school they know the difference between local government, State government and Federal government; they know the areas of responsibility that each has; they know what preferential voting is; and they get a solid basis of education in being citizens of Australia. At present, as a Federal member, I have people coming to ask me about the garbage dumps or the drains. This is because they do not know where these areas of responsibility lie. It is not their fault. The various Australian parliaments should try to implement a change, a curriculum, so that all Australians are taught their responsibilities and given the knowledge they need to be citizens of Australia. We have a great country. Everyone must be prepared and educated to pull their weight as citizens of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I refer to comments made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) in his contribution. Unlike the honourable member for Cowper, who at least has the dignity and good grace to operate in such a way as to earn the respect of members such as myself, the honourable member for Deakin does not earn that respect. One recalls that he was the member who was disciplined by the Privileges Committee of this House last year for accusations that he made about a parliamentary colleague. Tonight he has again tabled in this place documents relating to accusations about the propriety of a certain person in relation to gambling in Victoria. He has also made unsubstantiated allegations about the impact or otherwise of gambling on crime in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member referred to the establishment of casinos in various parts of Australia. He alluded to evidence which he said came from the United States and from Federal Police reports, but during the time that I was in the House-and that was for most of the time he was speaking-not once did he make a concrete reference to any evidence that there had been any increase in the crime rate directly attributable to casinos in the Northern Territory, where there are two casinos, one in Darwin and one in Alice Springs. He also referred to `a strange casino project on Christmas Island', which he said would be opened in the near future. There is absolutely no evidence to substantiate the claims that he has made in this House, in suggesting that criminal elements will be attracted to those casinos. </PARA>

Before coming into this place and asserting that there ought not be casinos in Australia, he should at least come in here and substantiate the assertions he made that there is an increase in criminal activity as a result of those casinos or as a result of the other gambling activities about which he referred. He did that, I understand, in relation to the work of the Federal Police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say that he is not the only person in conservative politics in Australia who seeks to denigrate the institution of the Parliament by making erroneous and quite scandalous accusations about individuals or organisations. I was the subject of a similar accusation to that which was made previously in this House about a parliamentary colleague of mine and in respect of which the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), defended the honourable member for Deakin last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister made an accusation in the lead-up to the Federal election campaign that I had been involved in a criminal conspiracy with the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Mr Terry Smith, and an employee of the Miscellaneous Workers Union of the Northern Territory, Ms Trish Crossin, to get around the immigration Act. Indeed, it was alleged that we had conspired. Allegations were made to the Federal Police that I had offended not only against the Migration Act but also against the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister made the allegation with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. He did it in the same sort of manner as the honourable member for Deakin does in this House repeatedly. The honourable member uses this House as a coward's castle in the same way as the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, without one shred of evidence used the coward's castle of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have seen last Friday evening on the 7.30 Report an interview with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) in which the Minister talked about the trade development zone in the Northern Territory. This interview followed an article which appeared last Friday in the Business Review Weekly. That article was headed `Darwin's disaster zone'. </PARA>
<PARA> The allegations which were made about my conspiring with others related to this `Darwin disaster zone'-the trade development zone in the Northern Territory. They related to the fact that one worker, one Huang Hangying, fled the trade development zone at the end of January this year. She fled the oppressive and inhuman working conditions that she was subjected to. She had fled the oppressive human rights practices to which she had been subjected by a company in the trade development zone for which the Deputy Chief Minister was directly responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> It comes as no surprise, therefore, that he should make these allegations. In the period that the trade development zone has been up and operating since September 1985, continuous allegations have been made by the Northern Territory Government about conspiracies on behalf of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement to bring down the trade development zone. I would ask honourable members opposite to read the report, if they have not already done so, in the Business Review Weekly and consider the question which was asked last Friday of Senator Peter Cook and the answer he gave in relation to the trade development zone. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take a short time to explain the nature of this zone and what it is supposed to do in terms of protecting individuals' rights and providing appropriate working conditions for its employees. As I have said, the zone came into being in September 1985. It was alleged at that time that it would bring great wealth to the Northern Territory. Indeed, it is a concept which is supported by me, the Labor Party and this Government. This was pointed out by Senator Cook on Friday. But, as Senator Cook also said, we are not in a position to be able to continue to support or have an open-ended commitment to that zone in terms of cost, especially `in terms of industrial relations or human rights'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to concentrate on the aspects of industrial relations and human rights. Two foreign companies in particular have taken advantage of the scheme to operate in the trade development zone. Hengyang Darwin and Hengyang Holdings of Hong Kong run Hengyang Textiles in Darwin. The other company is Darwin International Textiles Pty Ltd, which is another Hong Kong based firm. Both of these firms were recruited in the zone by the Northern Territory Government. Their purpose is to provide an industrial and manufacturing base in the Northern Territory as well as employment opportunities and skills training for people in the local labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> What in fact has happened is that under the aegis of the Northern Territory we have seen an absolute abuse by Hengyang Holdings of its right to bring foreign workers into Australia on the pretext that they would, in the first instance, be transferring skills to Australian workers under Australian award conditions. Indeed, what in fact has happened has been that Hengyang has brought in workers but has not been paying them under Australian award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned one Huang Hangying who fled the trade development zone at the end of January. The week after she fled the zone a number of Chinese workers came to my office in the dead of night because they were concerned about their safety, their security and their jobs. They wanted to blow the whistle on what was happening in the zone. I would like to read just briefly from the notes of that meeting which portray the concern of these workers and the conditions under which they had been employed for up to 18 months in the zone. I might say that the notes were taken down by an interpreter who was employed for the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> What is of relative importance are the hours that they worked. The question was asked of them, `What hours do you work? How many hours a week do you work?'. They responded, `It depends on the company's orders'. If they were asked to go through the night they had to do so. In other words, they worked from, say, 8 o'clock in the morning right through the night to the following morning. I then asked them, `Do you get paid extra money for those hours?'. The response was that they get paid-listen to it-15c Australian an hour for any extra hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The workers have a basic salary of $US120 per month. On top of that $30 was sent home to their families in China. For the other hours they work they get 15c an hour extra. It makes one wonder how a person such as the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, a Minister of the Crown no less, a Minister responsible for the administration of this zone, could tolerate those working conditions, especially as he was a signatory to a tripartite agreement between his Government; the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; the Department of Employment, Education and Training; and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. This was an agreement which had been negotiated and which came into force in September 1989, an agreement in which the Trade Development Zone Authority, in other words the Northern Territory Government, was to act as the agent for the companies wishing to make use of the scheme. It was an agreement where the employers were expected to abide by relevant industrial awards and where the Trade Development Zone Authority, the Northern Territory Government's agent, was to assist in the monitoring arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister has consistently abused his position by saying, in the first instance, that the Labor Party was out to bring down the trade development zone when he was tolerating the gross exploitation of foreign workers in this country, and for what purpose? The total cost to the Australian taxpayer of this scheme thus far has been $45m since it was implemented in September 1985. According to the Business Review Weekly at the moment it employs 198 Australian workers in four different companies and 70 Chinese guest workers who are supposed to transfer skills to Australian workers. In fact, they have not. </PARA>
<PARA> What they have seen is an abuse of the immigration laws of this country, of the industrial relations laws of this country, and of the powers that the Northern Territory Government had to deal with foreign companies to bring them into the trade development zone. </PARA>
<PARA> The person directly and ultimately responsible is the Northern Territory Deputy Chief Minister. He accused me and Terry Smith, the Leader of the Opposition, and Trish Crossin from the Miscellaneous Workers Union, of a criminal conspiracy because he knew the game was up and because it was the beginning of an election campaign. At the beginning of an election campaign on quite fatuous grounds allegations were made about my activities which had no foundation, proof or substantiation. They were allegations which were made in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. They were allegations which that person refused to make outside the Assembly and allegations he has subsequently had to withdraw because he knew that he sent the Australian Federal Police out on a wild goose chase. Yet there was no apology to me, to the Opposition leader, to Trish Crossin, to the Northern Territory community, to the Australian taxpayers, or to the workers of the trade development zone. They were just excuses as to why they were not performing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not in this country's interests to tolerate the sorts of activities that have been promoted by the Northern Territory Government in the trade development zone. It does have implications for our relationship with our neighbours in South East Asia. It is not good enough for the conservative politicians in this country, masquerading as they do around the idea of free enterprise, to come into parliaments and make accusations which they cannot substantiate on the basis that they are in an indefensible position. That is exactly what happened in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the net gain to the Northern Territory. One must ask what profit there is in the Northern Territory or the Australian economy to have this particular company, Hengyang Textiles, involved in the Northern Territory. It imports its labour. It carries out its activities in infrastructure supplied by the Northern Territory Government-a cost in the trade development zone of $45m-and it expatriates the capital which it makes. The only direct spin-off is the small amount of labour which has been employed in the zone since its inception. There are no other direct spin-offs except the very negative view which is portrayed internationally. It is worth recalling how the Far Eastern Economic Review refers to this zone. It has referred to it as the zone of exploitation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about these Bills that are before the House, in particular, two aspects of Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation Bill (No. 3). In one case they are an indictment in general of the policies of intervention. In the first case they are not the responsibility of the present Government, or of an Australian Government for that matter, and in the second case they are a very real indictment of the policies of intervention of this particular Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) there is an item which asks for $15.6m to be paid for outstanding debts to what was incurred by the International Tin Council. These are debts that have been acquired by each of the 22 tin producing member countries of the International Tin Council as a result of the ITC's failed attempt to manipulate the tin market and hold floor prices up until 1985. The interesting thing about this particular exercise, which in this legislation is costing the Australian taxpayer alone $15.6m and taxpayers from other countries similar amounts, is that it underlines and emphasises the problems of trying to hold floor prices in a depressed market. It is a lesson that should be learnt in a whole range of other industries which operate on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of schemes, as members of the House would be aware, are as old as history. In this particular case the International Tin Council used to have a fund which it established, as I understand it, from the member countries and companies of that particular tin council. In the early 1980s the international price of tin started to decline. It was forced down because one non-member of the International Tin Council, Brazil, became a very major tin producer. Brazilians saw that the tin price was pretty good; it was a high price. Brazil found that it could produce tin and sell it very efficiently and profitably at that price. Inevitably it increased its output. Over a period its exports increased from 4,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes. Interestingly, the International Tin Council had a floor price. While Brazilian production increased very substantially from 4,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes the 22 members of the International Tin Council decided that they would have to prop up their floor price. The International Tin Council went into the marketplace to buy up tin in order to maintain the floor price. Consequently, it accumulated a gigantic stockpile. I think I am right in saying that the statutory limit that the Tin Council was supposed to accumulate was something like 63,000 tonnes but its stockpile went above that limit up to 80,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> While all this was happening the Brazilians were thinking to themselves that this tin mining and marketing was becoming so increasingly profitable that they had to keep on producing, which they did. The inevitable consequence of all that was that the Tin Council could no longer afford to maintain its artificial floor price. The floor price finally collapsed because the Tin Council collapsed under a mountain of debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Eventually a Government such as ours and our people, the taxpayers, had to pay the bill for the collapse of the Tin Council. It has to be remembered that that policy also put tin consumers at a very substantial disadvantage because, until the collapse of the scheme, those tin consumers ended up by having to buy tin at an artificially high price. So, broadly speaking, consumers ended up being the losers because they paid more for tin than would have been normal under the international price arrangements. So, indeed, the consumers were losers as taxpayers when they had to bail out this failed economically nonsensical scheme. The International Tin Council's attempt reaped a very bitter harvest. The number of companies trading in tin that have been hurt is simply enormous. Some estimates are that around 40 per cent of Malaysian tin companies eventually went broke as a result of this particular scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1985, when the collapse of the International Tin Council occurred, the industry has begun to recover, with prices again beginning to approach what was the old floor level, but what is interesting is that there is a cartel known as the Association of Tin Producers Council, which once more is in the marketplace, not on this occasion by setting floor prices and intervening directly in the market, but by trying to control production and exercising limits on the amounts of production. Some of the major tin producers of the world are not members of the Association of Tin Producers Council and it is only as a result of the goodwill of those non members, in particular China and Brazil, that production has not been increased beyond the levels that are set by the council and consequently prices have remained moderately firm. But the fact is that, if those two major tin producers, China and Brazil, decide to abandon that voluntary arrangement-and it is quite possible they could, because those countries are in desperate need of foreign exchange-then, once more, the tin industry will enter a period of some disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point I want to emphasise by drawing the House's attention to the $15.6m that Australian taxpayers are being asked to fork out on this occasion through this legislation is that schemes such as the International Tin Council's cartel are doomed to fail. We all know what happened to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), yet when Milton Friedman predicted many years ago-I think in 1974 or 1975-that OPEC would eventually collapse, people laughed at him. Of course, like all cartels and like all price fixing arrangements that do not take any notice of market signals and messages, they are doomed to fail. I believe that the lesson of the Tin Council is something that, in the current context of the crisis of the Australian wool industry, all Australians ought to give some attention to. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect of this package of legislation to which I want to refer is an item in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) which asks for $6m of taxpayers money to be paid to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd as a bounty on sensitised film production. This issue of the Kodak bounty was dealt with at some length last year when it was first raised, but it is important that I again draw the attention of the House to the fact that in this legislation ordinary taxpayers are being told that they have to stump up the first $6m. This $6m is part of the Government's three year $36m production bounty to keep Kodak from apparently moving its Coburg operation overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to recall that that decision was announced by Senator Button and at the time of that announcement it was described colourfully by the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers as mindbending. This deal amounts to little more, if I may say so, than corporate extortion. A company has gone along to a Government, threatened the Government, and sadly, the Government has simply caved in. It is an example of an Australian Government, yet again, propping up an industry which is inefficient and, as a result of its inefficiency, is forced into a state of decline. Because of the ascendancy of electronic photography or video stills which will replace this sort of technology, the Coburg plant technology will almost certainly be obsolete by the time this deal eventually expires in five years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that all honourable members should try to concentrate on the point that the only manufacturing industries worth having in this country are those which can compete successfully on export markets, or with imports, and they are the industries we should try to encourage, not sunset industries, and not industries which go along to the Government and threaten the Government in a lead-up to an election. Indeed, what is even worse than Kodak's threatening the Government is that the Government actually caved in to that particular threat. I think that brings home the meaning of the expression that Senator Walsh used the other day about the Prime Minister being spineless, because it is noteworthy that at the time this plant was in the Prime Minister's electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Without wishing to appear to be xenophobic, another point that I think is worth emphasising is that the Kodak plant to which we are referring is not an Australian-owned plant but a foreign owned and controlled plant. Whilst I do not favour the Government giving money away by this sort of method to companies of any kind, it is particularly reprehensible that the Government has made the decision to give the money to a foreign company. If it were going to start handing cheques around at the expense of Australian taxpayers, I suppose it would be fairer if that money, since it was financed by Australian taxpayers, were given to an Australian company. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this decision to award this bounty to Kodak demonstrates several important points. First, it vindicates the sort of criticism that Senator Walsh has been making of the Government being pragmatic and spineless. It is no coincidence that this deal was sewn up, as I said already, in the lead-up to the Federal election when the Government apparently was at its most nervous and, in particular, the Prime Minister was at his most nervous, bearing in mind that this plant was in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, this particular financing at the expense of ordinary taxpayers underlies the failure of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and therefore the strategy of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce for a manufacturing export led economic recovery. When one looks at the last month's balance of payments figures and distils all the rhetoric one hears in the community about what is legitimately a catastrophic figure looking at it in absolute terms, one sees that one of the things that were particularly sad about those balance of payments figures was the failure of Australian manufacturing industry to improve its export capacity. I forget the precise figures, but in the last quarter of our balance of payments figures there was a decline of something like 20 per cent in manufacturing exports. If that trend continues, the future of this country is very dim indeed. If the Government thinks that the solution to our balance of payments crisis is to take money from taxpayers, to take away incentive from people by increasing those taxes and by increasing company taxes, and by farming it out to not just American companies but any company which is threatening to leave Australia if it does not get the grant from the Government, the Government is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, Senator Button lacks confidence in his own policies. If ever there was an admission of that, it was this particular initiative by Senator Button and by the Government. It really begs the question: Now that Senator Button's plan for the car industry can be seen to be failing, will similar deals such as this be offered to the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd, Nissan Motor Company (Australia) Pty Ltd and General Motors-Holden's Ltd? If one looks at the quote today from the Treasurer's press conference, one wonders all the more. I just remind the House what the Treasurer said outside the entrance to Parliament House today:</PARA>
<PARA>Now, in cars, Senator Button wanted to do a private deal with the car companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Was that the sort of private deal he wanted to do, and did do, with Kodak? I do not know the answer but, according to the Treasurer, he wanted to do a private deal with car companies through his department, that is, one which was not recommended or examined by the Industry Commission. The Treasurer, and this is one of the rare occasions when I will use this expression, to his credit said, `I told him that was unacceptable'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also made the point that in 1985 it took 33 weeks to buy an Australian car. That was two years into the Hawke Government. It now takes more than 40 weeks. He went onto say:</PARA>
<PARA>We've now got long waiting lists for Australian cars and we have to import them which is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to underline how Australia was failing-as I have been saying in this debate today-as a manufacturing nation. In saying that, he was conceding that the Government's and Senator Button's industry policy had been a failure. </PARA>
<PARA> In a sense, Senator Button, who is a man given to frankness, admitted this in relation to the Kodak deal. He was so embarrassed by the whole affair that he described it as `an aberration from government policy' and claimed that it would not happen again. The only thing that worried me about that claim that it would not happen again and the admission that this was the wrong thing to do was that Senator Button-it has been revealed by the Treasurer-was in any case very recently trying to negotiate some private deal with car companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting this precedent of the Kodak case, Senator Button has really opened up some sort of Pandora's box. What criteria could the Government implore when other companies approach it with threats of closure unless bribes are made to keep them here? What will he say when a company which may in fact be quite profitable-and Kodak was making profits-comes along to the Government and says, `Give us $36m over five years and we promise we won't close down'. Maybe it is not thinking of closing down, but the prospect of all this taxpayers' money to be extorted makes it enthusiastic to try to get a share of it. A government should never do that sort of thing. If it does give in to that sort of bribery and that sort of threat, then simply more threats and more bribery of that kind will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> What does Senator Button now say to all those Australian companies who have had to close down or relocate overseas because operating costs in this country are prohibitive and because the Government has failed to undertake micro-economic reform? They have closed down; people have lost their jobs; and they did not get $36m. </PARA>
<PARA> A textile plant in my electorate is in the process of closing down for economic reasons. It is very hard on the people who work in that factory. But they were not offered $36m or some pro rata amount by the Federal Government because they did not threaten the Government and try to bribe it in the way that Kodak did. </PARA>
<PARA> How consistent is this particular initiative with the Government's grant strategy in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations where it is saying, quite rightly, that we have to reduce protection levels, that there has to be a 30 per cent reduction in tariffs and that there has to be the elimination of non-tariff barriers and the like, when the Australian Government is going around giving $36m of taxpayers' money to prop up Kodak? What countries will take Australia seriously if we go on behaving in that sort of way?</PARA>
<PARA> To add insult to the very real injury that has been done, in recent days the Bureau of Industry Economics has informed us of what is happening with this particular Kodak factory which has just been propped up with taxpayers' money. It has done a study of Kodak factories in four countries-the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. It is interesting to study labour productivity in the Kodak plant in Australia. I should say `our plant' because it is you, Mr Deputy Speaker, me, everyone in this House, the people in the gallery and the great public of Australia who are paying for this factory to stay in place. Productivity was 83 per cent higher, not in Brazil, Japan or some mega-growth country like Taiwan, but in the British factory. And capital productivity in the British factory was 67 per cent better. Goodness me, Mrs Thatcher has turned that country around. But, heavens, it is a terrible indictment of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau suggests that the best way to boost productivity in Australia is, amongst other things, through more flexible working hours and shift arrangements, by giving people on the shop floor more authority and responsibility, and by cutting the inflation rate. Interestingly enough, that is the coalition's policy. The two particular issues that come through in this package of legislation are issues that the Australian public really needs to think about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tin Council underlines the danger of concocting phoney cartel arrangements and trying to rig markets. It always fails. The Kodak deal is the worst sort of action a government can take-to try to prop up inefficient companies and to encourage them to remain inefficient. From the bottom of my heart I really do condemn the Kodak deal and I know my constituents would agree with me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of Appropriation and Supply Bills, which comes to the Parliament at this time each year, tidies up the Government's expenditure program for 1989-90 and provides Supply until 30 November 1990, by which time most new Budget Bills should be in place. Nevertheless, it gives me the opportunity to look at the broad Budget picture and at the economic history of this Government. It is an interesting situation. For instance, we find that in the Budget brought down for the current financial year the people of Australia, as individuals are paying more tax-$51,320m, to be exact-than the total collections of taxation from all sources in the last Fraser Budget. In fact, they are paying some $7 billion more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that pay as you earn (PAYE) taxpayers in the current Budget are paying almost as much tax as the total collections of the last year of the Fraser Government. In that year the Fraser Government raised about $44 billion, of which $41 billion was tax. This year PAYE taxpayers are paying some $41 billion in tax themselves. It gives honourable members some idea of the massive growth of tax under the Keating administration as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other interesting points worth noting. One is the growth of tax on superannuation from $7m in the previous year to $885m in the current year. We see that the Government will require some $10,689m for its general purposes in that three months of the new financial year. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) tells us that this is an increase of 7.5 per cent on the comparable period for last year. The tip is, therefore, that both growth and inflation will be of that order. That is the other great problem confronting Australia. Whilst the rest of the world seems to have been able to come to grips with inflation, Australia has not. The situation seems to be getting worse. This of course is a major problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We should quickly look at economics under the present Treasurer (Mr Keating). We have had some quite amazing situations. We had that amazing $9 billion deficit-the inherited deficit. I have always wondered why anybody would want to inherit a debt. I always wondered why, having taken over the shop, someone then wanted to blame the previous owner for his borrowing strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, those of us who were present at the time know that of the eventual $8 billion-it was not $9 billion; the Treasurer uses that figure-of overspending in Treasurer Keating's first ever Budget of his own making, there were new spending initiatives of $7 billion, one significant amount being Medicare, which certainly was not promised by the Fraser Government in that particular election. We know that that is costing thousands of millions of taxpayers' dollars today. The Treasurer introduced this myth to meet a different aim. But just taking a bit of insurance, he blamed it on the previous Government. When we look at the Labor policies of the 1983 election, we see that its total economic policy was contained on one fools-cap typewritten page. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer did not have too many promises to keep. That may have been to his advantage, but the simple fact is that he was under no obligation to continue any level of deficit that he believed a previous government might have contemplated. He is the one who lectures us about tough decisions. He is the one who could have taken his first tough decision and balanced his first Budget. It would only have taken political will. The economy would not have disappeared because the economy was just growing out of the drought and the international recession that had affected it so badly in that period from 1980 to 1982. Of course, Malcolm Fraser was blamed in that case for bad economic management. The poor fellow did not know how to make it rain-a disgraceful situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Treasurer did that deliberately because he was of the belief that he could kick-start the Australian economy by overspending. It was a deliberate mechanism and unfortunately it worked. We are reaping the whirlwind of that overheating of the Australian economy that occurred in the first Keating Budget. He went on in that way, continually into the fourth Budget year, blaming the Opposition, stoking up the economy, but he wanted to add a few extra measures. One day he had a flash of inspiration, not to be found in his one foolscap page of economic policy: he might deregulate the Australian financial system. There had been a lot written about that. A lot of people had said it was a good idea. It is a bit like some other economic theories on taxation we read. He just did it one day. He floated the dollar. He did not know what effect that might have, and I do not know that he cared. It sounded a good idea at the time. Away again went the Australian economy-not on productivity, hard work or savings, but on borrowed money. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a funny thing about a national economy. There is only one difference between a Federal Budget and a household budget: the noughts on the end of the figures. All the other rules apply. One borrows money, spends it, accelerates spending and looks rich. People can be employed, even in a household sense. Then comes the fateful day when the lender says, `I would like my money back'. On that fateful day when he discovers he cannot get it, he says, `Well, I have another solution. I will just charge you double for it because you are now a very bad risk'. We all experience that personally, but the same thing has happened to our country. We have borrowed $100,000m to create 1.6 million jobs, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer boast. The total cost of the wages of that job growth is in that $100,000-$60,000 a job, or four years wages, if you like. It is not very smart because it has had the wrong effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, as a reaction, constantly presents himself as a person who has this grand plan for Australia. He is a fix-it merchant, a patch-up merchant. He floated the Australian dollar because the money market dealers of the world were playing games with the currency. They push it up 10 per cent and push it down 10 per cent and make a lot of money both ways. the Treasurer threw them the ball and said, `You go and play with it.' But he did not know, did not understand and did not explain to Australia what might happen. He did not warn the banks that it looked like there was a fortune to be made. They now find that 24 per cent interest is barely enough to cover their bad debts. Who is paying the 24 per cent? It is those hardworking Australians who are still in business, the very people we want to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Treasurer achieved; this is where the Australian economy stands today. We have this massive economic growth of 3 or 4 per cent, equal to that of the Japanese. We just happen to have one simple difference from the Japanese, through. They have 3 3/4 per cent labour productivity growth whereas we have minus 0.2 per cent labour productivity growth. Our growth is debt funded and it will go on being debt funded, except that it is not now a case of buying less from the rest of the world. We have to find close to $1,000m a month to pay the interest bill. That will not go away, even if we stop buying anything. Who do we blame for that? The Treasurer, in his typical style, will always find someone to blame-never himself. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a new problem; some of his colleagues are getting cold feet. There was a debate here today in which some of my front bench colleagues quite properly raised the formal aspects of this matter in terms of the breach of Cabinet solidarity. That is a matter for debate in this Parliament. The fact, though, is that senior members of the Government are starting to fight with one another. They are trying to make sure they do not get the blame. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, one of the most astute Ministers, decided it was no longer a good time to remain around as Minister for Finance because public anger was eventually going to be directed at this Government. He wanted to be somewhere else so he declined the offer of a further stint as a frontbencher and now sits on the back bench telling everyone how he would have done it all those years ago, when in fact he was booming up the Treasurer for the wonderful steps he was taking. Senator Walsh believes he would have done it all differently if it had not been for his spineless Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button wants a few bob each way. He thinks that it might not be such a good idea to be too closely supportive of the Treasurer because Senator Button goes out and talks to business people, not antique clock merchants. In his portfolio he is obliged to talk to real business people. I know what they are telling him because they are telling us: they are going broke. Their order books are getting thinner by the day; everybody has closed up shop. People in business can no longer afford to increase their business with interest rates at 24 per cent. It is as simple as that. My own children, who are involved in the business of computers, one of the leading technology areas today, are finding it very hard with no business. Companies are falling over day by day. The good strong ones are going to survive and they are picking up some staff. But people are going broke, and so it becomes a chain reaction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is still lecturing us and saying that it is going to be a soft landing. If it is a hard landing, Senator Walsh and Senator Button do not want to be around for the bump. They are starting to dispute the Treasurer. In other words, the wheels are starting to fall off Labor's economic cart. The senior blokes know it. They are getting worried, and they want out. They are pretty smart to be in that position. It is just a pity that they could not have been more honest with the electorate quite some time ago so that the electorate had the opportunity to cover its losses and get itself some decent conservative economic managers. </PARA>
<PARA> It has never been surprising to me that our Treasurer has a little difficulty in managing this economy. After all, as I have informed the Parliament on previous occasions, he left school at 15 and had a brief flirtation with the private sector. I understand he actually took a job. Then he got himself a job with a trade union-a wonderful place to be-educated in hard free enterprise economics, which is fundamental to Australia. Then at the age of 24, having learned to work at least some numbers, he got himself elected as the member for Blaxland and he has been here ever since. It is a wonderful training ground, I might add, for practical economics. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a simple economic theory available to the Treasurer-it is a pity he never learned it-and that is that 2 plus 2 equals four. The Treasurer likes to make it any number that suits his daily argument. He has got this country into a terrible state of affairs. What is more, and no doubt this is well recognised by Senator Walsh and Button and a few others that are probably mumbling away on the sideline but do not know how to get the same level of publicity, we have only survived because these have been very propitious economic times in this period when we have continued to borrow. Our trade deficit this year is only going to be about $20,000m for one year. They have been good times. The rest of the world has been booming. All our commodities have been achieving extremely high prices. There was a time, not that long ago, when we were borrowing thousands of millions of dollars a month and yet we completely sold a $1m-plus wool stockpile. Every fibre of wool that could be grown and shorn in the country was sold. </PARA>
<PARA> But what is the situation confronting us today? We have to discuss legislation this week to confront a situation which the Wool Council of Australia in its own table says will probably result in a six-million bale stockpile of wool, one of Australia's leading export commodities, by 1992-93 at which stage the Wool Corporation will apparently owe overseas interests $4,000m. That is about $4,000m that has already been spent in Australia and possibly returned to the source whence it came as our rural industries, having received the money, have gone and bought overseas-manufactured rural equipment because that is the only place they can get it today. </PARA>
<PARA> The home of the harvester, the home of the stump jump plough, the home of bearings in plough discs, the home of cane harvesters, you name it-every worthwhile invention in broad acre agriculture has been developed here in Australia-and we buy that technology back from the rest of the world. The main reason for that is that in terms of labour productivity we were never able to sustain a competitive industry to support the brilliance of our inventors and our technology. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the issues. This is where this Government has failed. It just gave us the classic Keynesian kickstart. It did it in its first Budget and it did it deliberately. It has all flowed on to the situation confronting us today, and the Treasurer's only solution is high interest rates. `Hit them with high interest rates' he says. `It is a tough decision'. What has it achieved? It has not achieved any substantial reduction in our overseas deficit. That is what it was supposed to do. Everything was going to be hunky-dory at home and people were going to stop borrowing from overseas. Why would that happen? An interest rate of 26 per cent on Bankcard is fairly close to the 18 and 20 per cent that people have been paying for years. The consumers in Australia, with their $700 video cassette recorders, et cetera, are not very discouraged by that 2 or 3 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> But the bloke in my electorate who looked out the window last April, saw the rain falling and was aware that wheat as a commodity was something that could be sold easily around the world and at reasonable prices, went back to the breakfast table and said to his wife, `Mum, I think we will plant 5,000 acres of wheat this year', and Mum said, `Hang on a minute. We have only got enough money in the bank for 3,000 acres.' And he said, `Well, it is going to be a good year. I will check with the stock firm and ask them how much they will charge me to carry the rest'. Of course, the stock firm said, `Our current rate, Mr Smith, is 24 per cent', and Mum said, `We will plant 3,000 acres'. That is 2,000 acres of productivity lost to our export effort because the interest was too high to make it viable for that person to take the risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are the people with small factories and other people looking to expand. Who was going out looking to export at a 24 per cent interest rate with a labour market which nobody has been able to fix? Ralph Sarich, a Western Australian whom everyone knows, is getting huge publicity as he commences manufacturing his technology in Michigan, the United States. He told me personally years ago that he would never manufacture his engine in Australia for one simple reason. With high automation he could make an engine competitive with engines made in other parts of the world but he just did not know when he could get it out of the country. He could not guarantee supply to where the customers were. The cost of building up inventories in those importer countries to guarantee supply totally destroyed the viability of his product. There has been a total failure to fix up the waterfront so that our inventors and manufacturers can actually write a contract and deliver on time. They were Sarich's own words, and I am talking three or four years ago, maybe five, when I sat next to him on a TAA flight. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what our problem is. It is not understood. The Government gets its instructions from the wrong place. Maybe if at the time it had floated the Australian dollar it had deregulated the Australian labour market it might have got somewhere, but it did not do that because it was not able to. It would have messed up too many people's endorsements. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution to our wool problem and to our export problems is to look very closely at the value of a totally floating market and the influences there and either, through a continuation of our current dirty float or by recognising the problem, substantially devalue the Australian dollar. People can laugh about that but it is there already in reality. Any business that owed this amount of money would have its share price written down to nearly nothing. The Australian dollar is our share price. We will not get out of our problems without doing it. That is the sort of pain we will have to wear. But it can all be laid at the feet of a very arrogant Treasurer. It is a pity that he is not as good in his thinking as he is in his talking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be grateful, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you accepted my congratulations to the Speaker on his re-election to the high office. I would like to start my contribution tonight by referring in passing to a few comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who I am pleased to see is remaining in the chamber. He said that he believed that drawing up the Budget for the Australian nation is very similar to drawing up and administering a budget for a typical Australian family and that the only difference is that a lot more zeros are associated with the Australian Budget. I suppose that there is a great deal of truth in that. If the Treasurer of this country runs a very tight ship and is very careful about where money is spent that is good for our country and means that certainly there is less risk that the Government is building up debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us examine what has happened in the years under the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in regard to Commonwealth debt and outlays. If the honourable member for O'Connor digs out Budget Paper No. 1, on page 6.9 he will see a table which shows public sector outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. It shows that in the last Budget which was drawn up by a government of which he was a member Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product were 29.8 per cent. Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product in the last Budget of the Hawke-Keating Government were 26.2 per cent. The honourable member says that the Federal Budget is the same as a family budget, but using his own comparisons it is very clear that, under Treasurer Keating, spending has been much more tightly contained than spending under the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the person who was Treasurer when the member for O'Connor, was a backbencher, had his opportunity to participate in government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not able to hear the interjection from the honourable member for Lowe but I am sure that it was as constructive as his previous contributions in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor went on to say that this terrible debt has existed because of the terrible policies of the Government. We are not responsible for the economic policies of State governments such as those run by Mr Greiner and others. We are responsible for the debt of the Federal Government. And what is the debt of the Federal Government at the moment? It is zero, because under this Government we have had massive surpluses built up in the last two Budgets which have meant that we have paid up massive amounts of debt incurred by previous governments such as that in which the honourable member participated. </PARA>
<PARA> So what did the honourable member do during the days of Sir Philip Lynch and John Howard when they were running massive deficits at the Federal level? He did nothing. The honourable member should think about the contributions he makes in this chamber. He comes in here and explains to us all the things that are wrong but he does not seem to think that perhaps he could have done more in the years when he was in government. He perhaps could have done something in the years that he had control of the levers that determine what happens in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member opposite says that he believes that this Government taxes too much. I invite him to have a conversation with the Premier of New South Wales, the Premier of the Party that he supports, who has increased taxes and charges in New South Wales by record amounts. How much does one pay to register one's car in New South Wales these days? One pays more than $550 to register a car under Mr Greiner-$200 more than in any other State. Why? Because Mr Greiner cannot run an efficient economy. That is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Greiner, of course, is only interested in raising taxes and charges, every chance he gets. Whether one looks at rail fares for commuters, at electricity charges for consumers or the way he is treating teachers in NSW, his is a record of financial irresponsibility. So the honourable member for O'Connor should not give the House the suggestion that the Liberal Party is the party of small government and low taxes. Mr Greiner's record demonstrates that that certainly is not the case. I will return to Mr Greiner in a few minutes, but I just want to refer to one issue that has come to my attention in case I run out of time later on. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make some comments concerning the activities of a company associated with Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP). I would like to quote from an article that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald last year under the headline, `Mine dumping risks catastrophe'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Papua New Guinea's decision to continue dumping wastes into the Fly River could have catastrophic consequences for 40,000 people living in the river catchment, according to a leading anthropologist. Dr David Hyndman, of the University of Queensland, said the dumping could lead to ``another Bougainville'' as villagers reacted angrily to the destruction of their food sources and lifestyle. Concern is mounting over the PNG Government's decision earlier this month to allow the huge Ok Tedi copper mine to continue dumping heavy metal wastes and silt into the river. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has arranged for scientists to carry out investigations into this issue. It is something that I am concerned about and of course, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your own deep commitment to protecting the Australian environment, I know that you are also concerned about the potential mercury pollution of the Gulf of Carpentaria and waters to the north of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the ore is taken out of the mine in Ok Tedi and crushed and some basic manufacturing process is carried out on site. In similar mines around the world they provide for a tailings dam for the wastes of this manufacturing process to be stored. Unfortunately, a temporary tailings dam at the Ok Tedi site was washed away several years ago, and the company that is associated with the Ok Tedi mine has said that it cannot afford to build a new tailings dam to stop these wastes going into the Fly River. I am very concerned that the result of this activity is increasing concentrations of mercury washing into not only the Fly River but also waters to the north of Australia. There is a danger that that might affect the Great Barrier Reef and also some of the beautiful barramundi fillets that people in Australia are known to consume on the odd occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> With BHP seeking to have a reputation as a company that does not pollute the environment, I suggest to that company and its board that they should be doing something about reconstructing a tailings dam at the Ok Tedi site. Since BHP will be negotiating with the Government about the future of the Coronation Hill mine, I hope that the company will be prepared to make sure that while it might be a good corporate citizen in this country it will not seek to become a bad corporate citizen in a near neighbour such as Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the performance of the New South Wales Government, the State Government with which I have had the most to do. I am very concerned about some matters in the administration of that Government. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the last Budget the Federal Government provided for $13.2 billion to be made available in general revenue assistance grants to the States, an increase of $247m on the previous year. In the State election campaign in 1988 Nick Greiner promised that he would become the Manager of the Board of New South Wales Incorporated and he would make sure that the Government was run in an efficient manner and that taxpayers would benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> After two years, what have we seen? Taxes and charges are up. I have already mentioned the fact that to register a car in New South Wales it will now cost a minimum of $550-$200 more than in other States. Electricity charges and train fares are up. Rail services are down, as people can no longer book sleepers on country trains. Rail services are being shut down and replaced with bus services. Grants to charities, neighbourhood centres and welfare groups have been frozen, so that they no longer receive consumer price index increases. We have the Greiner Government running round the State, selling off State assets. In my own electorate the primary school at The Entrance North has been closed down; not because the student numbers are too low and not because a decline is projected in future years-in fact, the reverse-and not because the school is run down as it is quite a modern building. I think it was opened in 1981-82. For none of those reasons was there any need for that school to be closed and that land to be sold off. </PARA>
<PARA> The only reason that Dr Metherell and the Greiner Government have decided to close that primary school in my electorate is that the land has an ocean frontage at the North Entrance. For that simple reason the children are being made to travel all the way to The Entrance primary school. We have people associated with the State Government seeking to say that it is more efficient to sell off a school simply because it has an ocean frontage. I do not think that is sufficient government. I certainly suspect the motives of Mr Wal Murray, the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, the Minister in charge of ensuring that every vacant lot of land along the east coast of Australia is sold off to developers. I have great doubts as to the plans which Mr Murray has for that site at North Entrance. </PARA>
<PARA> We might also remember that in the 1988 State election campaign Mr Greiner promised that government funded advertising would no longer be used for political purposes. Do you remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, Nick Greiner promising that he would never use government advertising to score political points? In fact, Mr Greiner said that he was going to send Barrie Unsworth a bill for the government advertising in the last days of the Unsworth Government. What has been the record of Mr Greiner compared to his promises during the last election campaign? Every time one sees an advertisement which has been placed by any New South Wales Government department or government authority, one get this message at the bottom of the advertisement, `Putting people first by managing better'. It is frightening; it is almost like subliminal advertising. Every time one picks up a newspaper one sees this political slogan paid for by the taxpayers-forcing down our throats the message, which Mr Greiner would have us believe-that he is helping the people of New South Wales by managing better. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what the performance of Mr Greiner has been in trying to manage the State of New South Wales better. I quote to the House some comments made by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) who was the chairman of the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee in the last Parliament. The following comments were made about the use of consultants in the Federal Public Service:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Smith said that he believed the $70 million estimated expenditure-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, by the Federal Government-</PARA>
<PARA>on consultants was probably a conservative estimate because there had been ``a very rapid trend'' for ministers and departments to engage consultants for a wide range of tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> ``There is little or no scrutiny'', he said. Mr Smith said that the key question to be pursued by the Waste Watch Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Opposition's Waste Watch Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>would be whether the Government and departments were getting value for money by retaining consultants. </PARA>
<PARA>What has been the performance of the New South Wales Government in the use of consultants since the Liberal Party and the Opposition are so keen to make sure that the $70m spent at the Federal level on consultants is money well spent and that value is obtained for that $70m? The headline in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 September last year is: `Auditor damns use and control of government consultants'. The article says:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has employed 4,000 different consultants since it came to office, costing taxpayers $150 million in just 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> An Auditor-General's review of consultant services has revealed that more than 1,400 of these contracts, or 37 per cent, were awarded without tender. </PARA>
<PARA> In his annual report, tabled in State Parliament yesterday, the Auditor-General, Mr Ken Robson, criticised the number employed and the lack of formal guidelines covering their use. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to deal with the problems in engaging consultants in New South Wales. The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) suggested that his friends who run the State Government in Macquarie Street are, of course, top economic managers who make sure that money is never wasted. His friend, the honourable member for Bass, criticises the Government when $70m is spent throughout the whole Public Service on consultants. What is his friend Mr Greiner doing in New South Wales? There has been $150m spent on consultants in 12 months, and here we have the Auditor-General saying that 37 per cent of these consultants have been engaged without even going to tender. So how can one say that we are getting good value for money out of that in New South Wales? The way money is being thrown around New South Wales is frightening. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not stop at the use of consultants. In last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald the headline of an article was: `$29m lent without guarantees'. The subheading was: ` ``May not be repaid'', Auditor-General on motor race deal'. The articles states:</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Auditor-General has reported that a total of $29 million in Government loan facilities and guarantees were advanced to the backers of Sydney's international motor racing project without their personal guarantees of repayment. </PARA>
<PARA> In a review of the Government's fast-track plan to build the circuit at Eastern Creek, the Auditor, Mr Ken Robson, said that the directors of the building consortium had refused to provide any additional surety for a $20 million cut-rate loan provided by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Because Mr Greiner is unable to win the Olympic Games for Sydney and unable to win the frigates contract for New South Wales, Mr Greiner goes all out to win the Grand Prix for Sydney. He does not worry if he spends the taxpayers' money-up to $29m of it-to win the Grand Prix for Sydney. It does not matter because Mr Greiner has to get that motorcycle race for Sydney no matter how much it will cost the taxpayers of New South Wales. I do not think that is helping the people of New South Wales and I certainly do not think it is managing better. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless Mr Greiner came in as the white knight in 1988 who was going to stop corruption, make sure that government advertising was not used for political purpose and ensure that there was no misuse of the Public Service for political purposes. Let us have a look at what has happened to his standards on that issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that a former member of Mr Greiner's staff, Mr Gary Sturgess, was appointed Director-General of the NSW Cabinet office. All of us would sincerely believe that Mr Greiner would have searched the country high and low to find the most qualified person to fill that very important office. Unfortunately, there was no one better than someone from Mr Greiner's personal staff, Mr Gary Sturgess, to fill that job. I am sure that Mr Greiner honestly believed that Mr Sturgess was the man most qualified for this particular job. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at Mr Sturgess's performance. What has he been up to since then? I forgot to mention Mr Ian Kortlang, the other member of Mr Greiner's personal staff, who ended up head of the development department in the State of New South Wales. I am sure that Mr Greiner also searched very hard to find the person most qualified to fill that job. </PARA>
<PARA> What has Mr Sturgess done since he has been appointed Director-General of the New South Wales Cabinet Office in his role as a non-political public servant? We know that Mr Kortlang and Mr Sturgess did an investigation for Mr Greiner of development proposals on the New South Wales coast. Do honourable members recall when the issue first blew up over developments in the Tweed Shire? Mr Greiner sent his two fix-it men-Mr Sturgess and Mr Kortlang-to sort that out. They prepared a secret report for the Premier which was meant to investigate all the important issues surrounding these development proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that report has never been made public. The Opposition leader in New South Wales, Bob Carr, has been trying for months to have that report released. Mr Greiner made lots of promises about freedom of information legislation when he was in Opposition, but for some reason this report by Mr Sturgess and Mr Kortlang has been declared a top secret document and Mr Greiner will not release it to the Opposition because, for some reason, this does not fit within the guidelines of freedom of information. I wonder what does. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald one learns that Mr Gary Sturgess, this non-political public servant, employee of the taxpayers of New South Wales, was down here in Canberra last week having lunches and briefings with journalists in the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery. What business is it for a State public servant employed by the taxpayers of New South Wales to be down here mixing amount the gallery in Parliament House giving briefings on the way Mr Greiner has run the State of New South Wales?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) yawns. He does not think this is an important issue. I suggest to the honourable member that the electors of Lowe would think it grossly improper for their taxes to be paying for the Director-General of the New South Wales Cabinet Office to be down here running the political errands of Mr Greiner. If the honourable member for Lowe does not think it is important and if he does not think it is an abuse of the Public Service and the separation of powers, then I think there is something wrong with the honourable member for Lowe and his standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Greiner was quite happy to attack people like Tony Adams, the former head of a unit in the New South Wales Public Service because he was prepared to do an advertisement during the days of the Unsworth Government-an advertisement that told people in my electorate that if their specialist tells them there is a long queue to have cataracts taken out of their eyes or to have a hip replacement done, they could ring a hot line number and go to a hospital which was a bit further from home but they would not have to wait. I thought that was a great public service. </PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Greiner was elected, Mr Adams was axed because it was thought that he had done something political. The Director-General of the Cabinet Office in New South Wales is down here at the Federal Parliament doing Mr Greiner's political errands. Those opposite think that there is nothing wrong with that. The honourable member for Lowe yawns and says that that is no problem. I think it is a problem. I think it is grossly improper for a non-political public servant to be down here on Mr Greiner's errands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sitting here this evening listening to the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), I appreciate a saying that we often have from the Chair when questions are asked, that these are very wide-ranging debates. From what I have heard of the speech made by the honourable member for Dobell I think he has spoken principally about New South Wales and what is occurring there. I say to him that people in glass houses should not throw stones, because they are likely to break something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to those who are listening-the record will be in Hansard-that when Mr Greiner and Mr Murray came into government in New South Wales a couple of years ago they faced a State debt of $46 billion and a daily loss of $3m on the railways. One would expect them to do something about that. The people of New South Wales put them in. They obliterated the Labor New South Wales Government because it caused this. The people of New South Wales wanted a change, and they have got that change. Mr Greiner and Mr Murray have certainly been forced to give some very bad medicine economically to the State to try to get it back onto the track. The State of New South Wales is like a business that was not paying. If that is the case, one has to make it pay and has to make very great changes indeed. Those changes are being made. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like to see a passenger train or freight train pass major local railway stations. I think it is a great shame. Nevertheless, we accept the fact that something had to be done to remedy the situation, and the New South Wales Government has tackled that. As I will mention later, the Government has more or less started this State off again on a plain basis from taws. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the development along the north coast. I have seen judgment of the media in New South Wales. I am sure it can happen to all of us. While I do not pinpoint it anywhere, it is a shame when it happens because the public can get the wrong impression. I ask the honourable member for Dobell and any member of the Government: Can they tonight, or at any other time, point out any developments that Mr Murray or his Government have approved along the New South Wales coastline either on Crown land or anywhere else where they are directly concerned? I challenge the honourable member for Dobell and the rest of the Government to point out to this House and to the people of New South Wales and the rest of Australia where Mr Murray has approved of any developments. They are under consideration. There is always something under consideration. Basically the matters that are under consideration are those that were being dealt with by the previous administration and are still being dealt with by the Government in power now. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we get up in this place under the protection of this House, we must be very careful when we say that these things are occurring. If they are, I would like to know where they are occurring. I am sure that many people along the New South Wales coast would like to know. We have not seen them. I hope that sensible developments do occur. Mr Greiner and Mr Murray have very fine environmental rules in that State and they are tightening up on them. That is essential. We want to see that being done more often. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot blame Mr Greiner for losing the frigate contract for New South Wales. I remind the honourable member for Dobell that he, his Labor colleagues and myself all worked darned hard in the Sydney area, particularly the Newcastle area, to try to get the frigate contract placed with Newcastle, where we would have loved to see it. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us not say that Mr Greiner is actually responsible for the matter. If any blame is to attach, let us all share it and say that it is just a pity that the contract did not go to Newcastle, where we would certainly have liked to see the frigates constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent Federal election was a funny election. The people in my electorate, I think, were very undecided about how to vote. They were so uncertain and so worried about Australia that they were looking for change. I am quite sure that they did not want to vote for the Hawke Government, although one must be fair and say that, at the same time, they were doubtful about voting for the Liberal and National parties. Many people, therefore, supported the Democrats and the independents. To me, that is a straightforward sign that the people of this country are very concerned about the economy, and about other issues as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a lucky land, when one comes to think about it. We have a Celtic background, and our nation is just over 200 years of age. We must ask ourselves whether we are pulling our weight sufficiently for our own good. Can we afford to keep saying, `Righto, everything's quite okay, mate, let's just go ahead'? I believe that, if the direction of this country is not changed around, before very long we will face very hard times. We will face hard economic times which will affect the standard of education and health in Australia. Home ownership will be affected, as will ownership of land. The hard economic times will affect many other things also. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in Australia we need hard work. I would like to see support in this country for going back to a 40-hour week. The Government would oppose this, as would many members on this side of the House. People would contend that we are used to a high standard of living in Australia-and so we are. But I believe that times have been too good. We have been careless. We are all guilty of this, in particular we the administrators. We must tackle this problem very soon. As Senator Walsh, a prominent ex-Federal Minister, has said, it is time to have a look at ourselves and put ourselves in the direction of where we want to go. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a social security country. We believe in looking after those people who are disadvantaged, those people in the community who may not be treated fairly, such as deserted wives. We believe in providing refuges for children and all these sorts of things, but we will have to tighten up on those sorts of things. We will lose some of those things, even for those people who deserve support, unless we reduce our balance of payments and unless we can get interest rates and the national debt down. </PARA>
<PARA> The inflationary trend is 8.5 per cent. When I first came to this Parliament I learnt from the Treasurer and Prime Minister, as well as from other members from either side of the House, that the way to run into trouble is to keep inflation high. At present inflation is high, at 8.6 per cent, and it will grow higher and will be followed by greater unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We must realise that we have a responsibility to look at the economy and try to adopt the policies and the administration that are necessary to get us back on the right track. That was the issue at the last election. There was no other issue in Australia on 24 March last more pressing than that of the future direction of this country-to become solvent again, to continue our prosperity, and to place confidence in our young Australians and in our people. </PARA>
<PARA> We must get away from the business of criticising Asians or any other people who want to come to our land. Those people who want to come to our land. Those people come here and work. They come here and settle down and work. With the freedoms that they have got under the Constitution they know that they come here and, if they are lucky to be accepted for citizenship, start a business or just hop in and work. I suppose the nation is certainly taking advantage of their doing that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Appropriation Bills before the House tonight contain certain savings and extra expenditures in a number of administrations. It is the policy, of course, of any Government to bring these Bills before the House whenever they are required. I just want to speak about a few matters which I think are interesting. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is defence. We are very dependent upon defence. I have no great criticism about the hardware that Australia is purchasing today, including the frigates and the submarines. I suppose the way these things should be used is another matter. We have to keep our sea lanes clear and keep ourselves safe. We have to be prepared to go throughout the globe to any theatre of war which may lead to a danger for us. </PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that we must give more attention to the wastage that is occurring within our defence forces. It hurts me greatly to know of the number of service men and women who are today leaving the forces. I believe that they are leaving them basically because of pay and conditions. We must keep the hardware side going but not to the detriment of the pay and conditions of our service personnel. I do not believe that services salaries are keeping abreast of increases in the salaries of those in the Public Service and in industry within Australia. We must recognise this, and I trust that the Government will attend to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the Williamtown Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base within my electorate. I want to say something about that base, because it is important. Over 2,000 personnel are employed on the base, which is virtually the home of the new FA18 fighter plane, and there are facilities there to accommodate and train personnel for a long time into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have found certain problems there. Today my electorate office received a couple of calls from people who complained about the noise factor. The base was set up during the last war as a defence establishment. Today it has developed into a most important civil aviation airport. We talk about, of course, wanting to see it expanded and eventually an international airport established within the Newcastle region. Over the years a number of subdivisions have been approved around both the base and the weapons range, which is only a few kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a member of the Public Works Committee that did the hearing on the base before the building of the facilities to accommodate the new aircraft. At that time there was evidence before the Committee concerning the noise factor at the base. Unfortunately, as I say, both the Council and the State had agreed to these subdivisions taking place, at the time not appreciating the potential growth of that area generally and the actual importance of the base to the economy of the Hunter River district generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I submitted a minority report suggesting, first of all, that the Government should acquire homes within a certain radius of the weapons range. If that was not done I thought there should be a move made to relocate the weapons range to an area where it would not interfere with the residential areas around it. I am very concerned that the RAAF base generally is under pressure. I believe it has cooperated very closely indeed over recent years with the people living in the surrounding area. It advises people of manoeuvres to be carried out, and there has been general cooperation. Naturally new people are moving into the area, which is a fast growing part of our coastal belt. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter before with the Minister on behalf of my constituents. I do not want to see the base affected. The actual work carried out by the base is terribly important to the defence of Australia. However, I do not want the people on the base to have to worry. I ask the Government to take a long term view and look at relocating the weapons range to an area where it will not affect the local people or place the airmen and people working on the base under a lot of strain. I will certainly continue to pursue this angle because we want to see harmony between the local people and the base. If it is possible, a suitable site should be obtained elsewhere for the weapons range. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I listened to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) speak about the tourist industry. I agree with everything that he said. The Appropriation Bills contain provision for additional funding for certain aspects of the tourist industry. They contain an amount of $22.5m in respect of the recent pilots strike. Tourism is the growing industry in Australia. It is a great employer of the labour force and a great overseas money earner so far as Australia is concerned. We must do everything possible to support it and encourage it in every way. </PARA>
<PARA> My daughter and I were up in Queensland recently and it hurt me to see that some of the entrepreneurs who have established themselves in very big ventures up there and elsewhere in Australia are finding it very difficult to survive. This is a shame because these are the people who are providing the facilities. These people are having a job to survive simply because of the structure of our industrial relations system and our rising costs. We are now becoming uncompetitive so far as our manufacturing industries are concerned-in many cases, this applies to primary industries-and we are grossly uncompetitive with respect to the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to see more people from overseas coming to Australia. We want to be able to compete with other countries and attract people here. Queensland has three international airports. If Customs facilities were provided at Coolangatta Airport, the number would be four. That is very good planning. I do not want to say much about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Maybe I will have the opportunity to do so before the end of the week. But it is scandalous that planes cannot land there without experiencing certain delays. I am sure this is the reason that the overseas tourist promoters are passing Sydney by. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to support our local modes of travel. We have to support train travel. We have to do everything we possibly can in this respect. We have to look at how our penalty rates are affecting the tourist industry. In this respect I refer to the five-day working week and overtime. We have to look at these very vital areas. Mr John Brown spoke about this matter a lot when he was a member of this place and the Minister for tourism. I am sure that none of us would disagree with the fact that it is necessary to do something about this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have talked about community affairs but my time has almost run out. Our community affairs programs are important in looking after the disadvantaged and people who have problems. Let us not overlook the fact that the best people to support people in need are those who work for voluntary organisations. I speak of such voluntary organisations as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the churches and other groups that have played a magnificent role such as service clubs, Rotary, Lions and Quota which have supported people in need within their local areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I am worried that much government funding, both Commonwealth and State, goes towards paying for people who are taking the place of many voluntary workers who are capable of doing and are knowledgeable in this kind of work. Tonight I speak only about the principle involved in this issue. I hope that in future we can all be realistic and charitable enough to appreciate the work that these people are doing voluntarily in the community, looking after those who need care and the meals on wheels service. We have district nurses. The object is to keep people in their own homes for as long as we can to save us building nursing homes, hostels and units. That is a direction that I know the Government intends to take. I hope that it does not depart from that direction because in my view it is a very important one. </PARA>
