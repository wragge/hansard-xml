<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received no such advice from the Treasury. At the time the Budget forecasts were put together, the Treasury made a very pragmatic assessment about what was happening in the world economy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen references in the media to likely reductions in credit card interest rates. That speculation has been contributed to by the remarks of the Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority, Professor Fels, in his public comments today. I have made comments on credit card interest rates over the past few months, most particularly on 16 June, when I said that I believed the banks should reduce the interest rates they were charging their credit card customers. Since that time there have been some reductions in credit card interest rates. They are now at their lowest levels since the mid-1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is still room for further reductions as far as credit card interest rates are concerned. It should be recalled that cash rates are at 5.75 per cent. On that basis, one would expect that credit card interest rates could be much lower than they are at the moment. As Professor Fels said in his comments today, there was a linkage between a general deregulation of credit cards and the interest rate that is charged for them. One of the crucial issues here is whether or not the banks, or the providers of these credit cards, should be able to charge some kind of up-front fee, which at the moment is prohibited by State legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Consumer Affairs, in the context of the Council of Consumer Affairs Ministers, has been looking at this. Indeed, her predecessor and her predecessor's predecessor had been looking at these matters over the years. As yet, the States have not come to a view about how this matter should be handled; I think they are awaiting the PSA report before they do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no philosophical objection to some modest up-front fee, so long as this is reflected in a substantial reduction in interest rates charged for credit cards. The point is that at the moment the cost of providing the credit card facility is borne entirely by those who actually pay the interest. Of course, there are some who have the capacity to avoid paying interest by ensuring that they square off their credit card accounts in the interest-free period. This means that those people who have the capacity to do that receive a free service, whereas others who perhaps require the credit over a longer period end up paying a much higher interest rate and, therefore, end up bearing the entire burden of providing the credit facility afforded by these credit cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area is long overdue for reform. The Commonwealth has been quite clear in its view that reform should occur. We hope the States will come to that view readily&mdash;hopefully unanimously&mdash;once they meet again on this question. I believe there will be room for even greater reductions once the general reform has been agreed to.</PARA>

<PARA>She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper examines that vision and, in doing so, we should note that the style in which the document is written is a somewhat self-righteous style, in many places claiming the high moral ground. This, it should be noted, does not sit well with what can only be considered the deceptiveness of the pamphlet about Fightback, which tells us of all the purported benefits of Fightback but does not spell out the effects of the cuts to government spending and a number of other policy changes which analysts in this seminar have called draconian. Fightback denies the fact that many Australians work harder than is good for either their health or their families.</PARA>
<PARA>She continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback lacks a genuine vision.</PARA>
<PARA>She goes on in that vein. It is very obvious that what the Government said occurred in that meeting last week was correct. It is obvious from the statements by Bishop Power yesterday. Those naive people who are prepared to read the first paragraph of the letter and take Dr Hewson at his word ought to take note.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the whole Liberal tactic is to discredit any critic&mdash;to say that they are either leftists or are from somewhere else, not that they represent a genuine view in the community. The tactic is to discredit their views so that their criticisms can be put to one side, as Bishop Power eloquently said. This is the treatment that will be meted out to all the people who dare ask about what is, as Reverend Wansbrough said, not a philosophical statement but a policy document. If it is a policy document and the Liberal Party wishes it to be viewed as a policy document, people will ask questions and make criticisms of it. They should not then be attacked and sidelined and delegitimised, as the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Pearce now seek to do, branding decent people with a tag that they are leftist and therefore not to be taken seriously.</PARA>

One of the reasons they said that was that we were one of the economies in the world that had had the capacity to provide a fiscal stimulus in order to encourage a higher rate of growth than otherwise would have been the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the Deputy Leader is pursuing this point. Of course what happens in the rest of the world is one of the factors that will determine how well we go; but it is only one factor. At the time of the Budget we said that the sources of growth should be private consumption, housing and public investment, while the rural sector and private investment should also begin to turn around. What happens in the rest of the world is just one of the factors; the other factors have to be borne in mind as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing that has occurred in the world economy in the intervening period has required me or the Treasury to revise the estimates. Indeed, since the Budget I have spoken with the Secretary to the US Treasury and the Japanese Minister of Finance, as well as with Alan Greenspan and the officials I mentioned from the OECD. None of those people would suggest that we should make any revision of the estimates we made at the time of the Budget in relation to the impact on Australia of slower world growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what is happening in Australia, what happens in retail sales is significant. But the Deputy Leader should not make the mistake of leaping on to one month's data and trying to talk down the economy. We will not know until early December what the growth rate in the September quarter is. I think it is probably unlikely that we will see an acceleration of growth in the September quarter from the June quarter. Even if that were to be the case, that would still not require us to adjust the Budget-time forecast for the 3 per cent growth year on year that we made at Budget time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is totally disinterested in what I am saying, is interested only in plucking out from what is a disparate and partial set of data those bits that he thinks make his point about talking down the economy. Why, for instance, does he not talk about the housing sector, which is making a stronger contribution to the economy than was expected at Budget time? But no; that would fly in the face of the Opposition's basic tactic: generally to spread a bit more gloom around and to portray an economy that is in distress, when even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acknowledged in recent times that we are doing better than the rest of the world. We are doing better than the rest of the world precisely because of the policies we put in place both in February and during the Budget, policies that I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition he and his Leader oppose. They actually want less fiscal stimulus. Their policy is to have slower growth in this economy. They are not in favour of taking the action we have taken in order to encourage recovery in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government's position on traineeships, as it is on a whole lot of labour market and training programs, has been to develop a most careful program tailored to the needs of the people who are trainees, the employers who employ them, and the economy overall by providing it with the skills that are needed in order for us to grow and in order for our work force to be able to take advantage of new job opportunities that will emerge over the next decade. The traineeships are basically structured around the notion of a one-year period during which some 75 per cent of the time is spent on the job and 25 per cent in formal training. The trainees who are employed under this scheme also attract to an employer a subsidy of around $2,000 to $4,000 from the Federal Government. That structure has been built upon by the States, who have acknowledged the success of these programs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the States provide some element of payroll tax relief and in some cases, such as in Victoria, they also provide extra subsidies. The incentives that have been put in place are producing a very substantial effect. What happens as a result of these programs is that a trainee receives very solid work experience, a formal qualification which is very important to industry standards, and a reasonable living wage. An employer gets a keen young worker, who is rapidly acquiring a high level of training, but is required to pay only 75 per cent of the award rate, and that is further reduced by a subsidy of anywhere between $38 and $77 a week. As I said, State subsidies come in over the top of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three months there has been an increase of 90 per cent, compared with the September quarter last year, in take-up of traineeships. Increases by State ranged as high as 240 per cent in Victoria, where the State Government provides extra subsidies. More young people started in traineeships in these last three months than over the first six months last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question from the honourable member for Robertson asked about alternative approaches. At the time when the Leader of the Opposition talked about abandoning these sorts of schemes and going for the notion of establishing effectively a youth wage subsidy, provided by the youth as opposed to either the Government or the employer, a great deal was said on this side of the House about the notion, challenging the intellectual capacity of the proposition. None of that made any impact. Earlier this month the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My answer is that you can solve youth unemployment with the youth wage. There is no doubt about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those evidently, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> over the weekend which picked up on this, who have subsequently experimented with the propositions put forward by the Opposition whereby the unemployed youth in this particular aspect provide their own subsidy as opposed to its being provided by the Government, have found it a massive failure. I only go on the report that has appeared but the gentleman concerned, Mr Steve Stavreas, who runs a jewellery store in Canberra and in neighbouring Queanbeyan, is quoted extensively. Having experimented with the propositions of the Opposition and finding them total failures, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I just don't think that the system that Dr Hewson is talking about will work. Unless there are some very big changes, the kids are not going to be interested.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically the problem that he ran into, evidently from this article, was the obvious problem that, upon the individual employer, is flung the whole responsibility for devising of training arrangements. A particular TAFE course, or whatever, is supposed to be negotiated between a 16- or 17-year-old kid and an employer, who has better things to do with his time. He is out there trying to make money and produce the goods that his company produces. He is not there to be a professional educator or there to devise education and training systems; he is there to respond to what is offered. The obvious point that needs to be made from all this is that it is not a substitute to just stand up and say that the unemployed people can provide themselves with their own subsidy by our amending awards across the board to say that you can walk in and get 50 per cent or 75 per cent of the agreed wage, or whatever, and at some point you might be able to negotiate time off with the employer. That will produce absolutely nothing at all&mdash;no skills, no jobs&mdash;nothing that this economy needs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me assure the House that hours of work, penalty rates and holiday loadings not only can be varied in enterprise bargains but are being varied in many of the 350 bargains which have already been registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. The honourable member for Bennelong said last month&mdash;it is an interesting quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important message to come from the Opposition in the area of industrial relations is the quite dramatic proposal to move away entirely from the concept of a fixed working week.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the fixed working week is no longer, as hundreds of enterprise agreements now attest. Penalty rates and holiday loadings can be negotiated. For example, the National Australia Bank and the ANZ Bank have developed agreements which allow their employees to choose any combination of working hours which, in the case of NAB, amount to at least 38 hours a week or 152 hours a month&mdash;that is, any combination of working hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly flexible arrangements exist in the Sheraton Towers agreement, the Coles supermarket agreement, the Southern Cross Machinery agreement and many hundreds of agreements now being negotiated. The Sheraton Towers agreement has folded ordinary time earnings and penalty rates together into an annual salary regardless of hours worked. The Coles supermarket agreement provides wage increases in return for greater flexibility in working hours and reductions in night shift penalty rates. Workers in Southern Cross Machinery agreed to arrange their working hours so they receive one week's salary by working less than 38 hours a week in winter and around 42 1/2 hours in summer. There are endless examples in a list too long to read.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only condition we impose in all of this flexibility, upwards and sideways, is that the agreements not leave employees worse off than they were before. This is, of course, a condition that the honourable member for Bennelong wishes to attack. He is not after flexibility up and out; he is after flexibility down. That is one thing that the set of generic arrangements in place now for enterprise agreements, under the scrutiny of the Commission, will not allow. They will allow all manner of flexibility&mdash;penalty rates, changes to annual leave, working hours, maternity and sick leave, the lot; it is all negotiable, and it has been negotiated in hundreds of agreements&mdash;but the arrangements will not allow flexibility down. The one thing that the Liberal Party wants is to drive Australian wages down further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics show that in 1991 hourly labour costs for production workers in manufacturing in Australia were 20 per cent below the OECD average. That is, we are already hugely competitive in wages, and the notion that wages need to be pushed down further is simply about depressing Australian living standards and giving Australians the sorts of wage levels which obtain to our near north in developing countries. It is not, as members of the Opposition claim, for flexibility in the labour market and the workplace. Under the Opposition's proposals all these agreements and all Federal awards would be automatically cancelled. The only way any agreement would obtain is if both the employees and employers agreed. Otherwise, the whole award structure and agreement falls away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the transitional arrangement? The transitional arrangement is that the new agreements would be common law contracts, which would need a QC to enforce them. How is an ordinary person, say a metal stamper in a metals business, going to deal with the employer? If the employer happens to be a car company or a steel fabrication company, how is one small person going to deal with the employer? He is pushed into a common law contract and his only recourse is to get a QC to represent him in a common law case, which might take a year or two to be listed. In other words, all the Industrial Relations Commission machinery goes away. The machinery that is there now to look at any disputes where the agreement is not clear or where a matter needs to be settled goes. You damn some poor person on a common law contract to find a QC to represent him. The strength between labour and business, now that the wage share of GDP is at 1960s levels&mdash;as the American bureau says, 20 per cent below the OECD average&mdash;is not enough for you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is this claim that you need to have flexibility when you can roll penalty rates, hours of work, holiday pay, maternity leave and sick leave into any agreement you like, with any sort of flexibility, as has been done in hundreds of cases; you can do it up and out but you cannot go down. The flexibility you want is down. This ranks with the GST as one of the most pernicious policies being offered by the Opposition.

If we were not informed on these issues we would think that there was no exploration going on in the resources sector. Exploration expenditure is holding up and at very high levels. It has increased to $603m during 1991-92. Even after we take out a reduction in the exploration effort for gold as a consequence of the unwinding of the gold boom, we are still seeing a record expenditure, up around 14 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93 it is projected that capital expenditure will be at a record level of $4.7 billion. Try as the Opposition might, it is simply impossible to assert that this important sector of the economy has done anything other than move very well during the last decade, particularly in the last part of this decade. It ill becomes the Opposition to continue to talk it down. These figures show without any doubt that when those opposite attempt to do so it is without any foundation whatsoever.</PARA>

In the course of a decade, I, with my colleagues here, had to do all of your dirty work over 40 years. I wear it as a badge of honour, I can tell you. We opened up this country, removed exchange controls and took tariffs down.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly am aware of a number of comments that the rich spend more on food than the poor. That is not a surprising statement, but it seems to have been referred to much of late. The important thing is that the impact of any change in food prices is relevant in terms of the proportion of income that people spend on food, not the absolute dollars. One would have thought that would have been clear to everybody but, as I shall show, it is certainly not clear to many people in the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at those people on social security, our best estimate is that on average social security beneficiaries spend about 40 per cent of their income on food. The base levels of the pension and benefit have been set, historically, to allow for the purchase of these basic necessities, because they figure much more prominently in the shopping baskets of the less well off, of the beneficiaries, than those of the rich. Therefore, any change in the prices of food will have a much more disproportionate effect on the less well off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I think there is so much concern in the community about the impact of proposed changes to the prices of food. These changes are widely seen, and rightly seen, as being regressive. They hit the poor harder than they hit the rich. A much higher proportion of the income of the poor is spent on a tax on food. The GST is such a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was what the Catholic Social Welfare Commission was pointing out. I want to read this statement again. Honourable members will hear it a lot in the next few months, but it is an essential statement in the debate. The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that taxing people for their consumption of food . . . contravenes the Catholic social principles of the common good, human solidarity, human dignity, preference for the poor and the common use of goods.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a moral argument as well as an economic argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did we find from a gaggle of Opposition leaders in response to that statement? They ran around the country telling us that to exempt food from the GST would be unfair on the less well off because the rich spent more in dollar terms on food. It was an extraordinary argument, but honourable members will find it in the statements of the Leader of the Opposition, in the statements of the shadow Treasurer and most clearly and explicitly in the statements of the honourable member for Pearce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce will always take these things to extremes. What the honourable member for Pearce has discovered is that a food tax is possibly a progressive tax. To be fair to him, let me quote what he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxing of all food, rather than the exemption of essential foodstuffs, may well be progressive.</PARA>
<PARA>They are his weasel words&mdash;`may well be'. He is the first person in economics I have ever known to argue that a food tax may be progressive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what underlies this extraordinary argument. It is true that if one checks with the ABS then one will find that, in dollar terms, the wealthy spend more on food than do the poor. Let us look at the percentages. Take the wealthiest 10 per cent of this community. They spend 9 per cent of their income on food. Therefore, the wealthiest 10 per cent spend 9 per cent, but the poorest 10 per cent spend 50 per cent of their income on food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good saying, `This tax isn't regressive because the rich spend more on food than the poor'. You have to look at those percentages. They clearly show the regressive nature of this tax. The lowest 10 per cent in the community spend 50 per cent on food and the top 10 per cent spend only 9 per cent, which means that that food tax would have five times the detrimental impact on the bottom 10 per cent as it would have on the top. I do not see that anywhere in a papal encyclical you could find support for that sort of proposition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the then Treasurer said that we were entering a golden era of economic change, yet behind closed doors he and the Minister for Finance had set in train the deliberate engineering of the recession. Before we went into the 1990 election&mdash;and Pinocchio's nose was growing longer by the year&mdash;he announced with typical arrogance, `I will not let there be a recession'. Do honourable members remember when he was elected Prime Minister? At that press conference the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, `I've just got three things to say to the Australian public'. The first thing that he wanted to pledge to the Australian public was basically this: `Forget what I've told you in the past; in the future I'm going to tell you the truth'. Those opposite never tell people the truth about the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sensitive issue at this point in time. The fact is that we are in the worst recession for 60 years. Australia is going through very troubled economic circumstances as a result of 10 hard years of Labor. Those opposite are trying to paint a rosy picture that things will be great next year. That is basically their line. They say it with increasing desperation as every day goes by and as we get closer to the next election. I think anybody who is involved with the Parliament would know that for the whole of this year the Prime Minister has been trying to create a window of opportunity to rush off and go to an early election so that he can avoid facing an election next year when people will be able to see as plain as the nose on their face that our economic circumstances are such that the recession still rolls on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week we had a classic. On the first day of sitting last week, the Prime Minister came in here and said, `Look, this recession was over long ago'. There was no qualification, `I don't know what you're all complaining about'. It was like that famous one of Gough's when he went down to the farmers in Warragul and said, `You've never had it so good'. It was a `let them eat cake' situation. So on the first day of sitting the Prime Minister said that the recession was over long ago. The next day he came in here and repeated the statement. Then he announced that he was the one who saved Australia. So not only is the recession over, but he saved us. Then on the third day of last week's sitting, to add insult to injury, he came in here and said, `Not only is the recession over and not only am I the one who saved you, but I'm going to give you your future back'. The incredible arrogance of this bloke!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can imagine the phone calls on Friday night and Saturday from all the blokes on the other side. Frontbenchers and backbenchers on the other side of the House are getting increasingly worried that this Prime Minister has completely lost control; his mouth is completely out of control. The more he says, the more desperate the untruths that he states, the less their chances are of getting back into office. As we saw last week, the Prime Minister said in the Parliament that the recession was well over long ago. But no-one in the country believed him. It was just incredible the disbelief across the land as a result of that statement. There was no-one saying, `Hallelujah! Paul Keating saved Australia. Thank you for the worst recession for 60 years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Sunday morning, Senator Button had a television interview with Laurie Oakes. Senator Button is no Johnny-come-lately to Federal politics. He is no chicken. He did not come down in the last shower. He has been around this place for a long time. He has a deserved reputation for being a bit more frank and honest about how things are than the Prime Minister and, I must say, his new Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program Senator Button was at great pains to be very careful in announcing what he thought was the state of the economy. Mr Oakes kept saying, `Do you want to go over the top like the Prime Minister did and declare that the recession is over?'. Senator Button was actually asked a question by Mr Oakes, and it is worth quoting and giving the context of it. Laurie Oakes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How long will it be before Paul Keating, or anybody else, can stand up and say the recession is over, without people saying, `Well, he's technically correct, but . . .'? When do we lose the `but'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a considered remark. He went to the Channel Nine studios on Sunday morning with a premeditated intention to blow the whistle on the Prime Minister's very optimistic, over the top claims from the week before. This was no slip of the tongue; this was a statement that was volunteered. I read out the question to honourable members. It was not a situation of Laurie Oakes's getting into Senator Button like a terrier, and asking, `What are your forecasts? Where do you stand on this?', he just brought it out on his own accord, and he did so quite deliberately. He volunteered it, not as some incompetent who is just blundering through an interview with Laurie Oakes but as a person who has had a lot of experience as the third most senior economic Minister in the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very clear statement which just blew apart all the claims that the Government has been making. Its claim is that things are going to be much better next year, we have this growth of 3 per cent. Senator Button is saying that he does not believe so. I do not just rely upon his experience and reputation on this matter. If honourable members have been reading the papers, they would have seen that the Government has been receiving advice upon which Senator Button presumably came to that assessment. We saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Friday&mdash;presumably Senator Button read this if he needed to&mdash;the following quote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, senior government officials and advisers have returned from northern hemisphere trips over the past fortnight bearish about the outlook for the world economy. . . </PARA>
<PARA>There it is. We have confirmation through a very close source to the Government, Michael Stutchbury. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian officials now recognise that their Budget forecasts for the world economy are also probably on the high side.</PARA>
<PARA>It is as clear as the nose on your face. The fact is that Treasury, the Government and DITAC have been receiving advice that the basis upon which the Budget forecasts were prepared, which is an assessment of the world economy, has been slipping away from them and has been eroding. That is fresh advice that the Government has been receiving. Instead of trying to give the public a reasonable assessment of the state of the Australian economy, we have nothing but deception. I also have no doubt that, not only in that source of advice but also in the possible parliamentary question briefings that the Treasurer and Senator Button would have had for last week's parliamentary, there would have been commentary on the state of the Australian economy which has obviously stuck in Senator Button's mind and upon which he made his claim yesterday. We have an experienced Minister who I am sure has been given advice in the last week or so which confirms and provides the basis upon which he made his claim on Sunday. But the fact is that it has all happened before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some celebrated cases. Remember that one back in May 1990? The Prime Minister had caused the recession but he did not want to admit that the economy was in recession. Someone asked him whether we were technically in a recession. He said, `What is this technical recession nonsense? I know a recession when I see one. I do not see one now. I will tell you what a recession is: high unemployment, bank failures and people selling assets that they have not got'. That was a bit galling for Senator Button, but it is still true of course. A few days later&mdash;we took this quote out at random from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>&mdash;he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Minister, Senator Button, said yesterday that Australia was in an "economic downturn of some severity" and warned against talk of rising living standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His comments contrasted with a statement by the Treasurer, Mr Keating, who said on Friday that it was not the Government's view that Australia was in recession.</PARA>
<PARA>One forgets these things, but there was a great furore about this; in fact there was talk a few days later of Senator Button actually getting the sack for the acrimony that had been caused within the Government's ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that was not the only time. That was in May 1990. Mr Keating was saying, `We do not even have a recession'. Seven or eight months later, in November 1990, he was saying, `We have had a recession but it is over'. This was the fastest recession we had ever seen! He was into it one minute and out again the other side. On 29 November he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is entirely possible that the, in terms of output, that the worst impact of the recession has in fact passed.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that not sound familiar: `The worst of it is behind us'? That is what he is saying now, two years later. In November 1990 he was saying that the worst of it was probably over. Senator Button, on the famous second occasion, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> a few days later, on 3 December 1990, as follows:</PARA>

<PARA>There was another great to do about that because Mr Keating was saying one thing and Senator Button, not being prepared to put up with that dishonesty, went on the public record to give the public a more reasonable and honest appreciation. Again in April 1991 Mr Keating said, `We are seeing a recovery coming through now. I think you can see a recovery coming through'. It is the same every year. This recovery is always coming. </PARA>

If Geelong had won the grand final, perhaps he would have been in a better frame of mind in the last couple of weeks. That can be the only explanation for the comments that he made yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one actually looks at the whole of the interview&mdash;and of course the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) read out a bit of it&mdash;one sees that earlier in the interview, when Senator Button was asked about the question of the recession and when it had been over, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As distinct from many other countries, the Australian economy is now growing again. Not as fast as we would like, but it is growing.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment always grows later than a turn around in the economy itself and I think most commentators understand that.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are remarks, almost word for word, that I made last week. He went on to say in answer to another question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What seems to me to be happening out there is that many businesses with whom I talk&mdash;their bosses&mdash;they say that their sales are improving, their profits are quite good but that is not yet reflected in their capacity to take on new employees. Now I think that's a fair summary of the position across the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole point is that the remarks Senator Button later made about the Budget forecasts were inconsistent with the remarks he had made earlier about Australia doing better than the rest of the world and about business seeing prospects picking up. It was for that reason that Senator Button realised very quickly that he had made an error and decided to make a statement in order to say that he continued to have confidence in the Budget forecast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked for a realistic assessment of the state of the economy. I do not think there could have been a more realistic assessment of the state of the economy than that which was provided in the Budget. The Budget is still before the House; it is still being debated in the House, and the economic prospects contained in the Budget are there for all to see and for the Opposition to debate if it likes. It is a realistic assessment. There has been, as I said at Budget time, no gilding of the lily. That was a very sober assessment of what we believed the Australian economy could do in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made the point on many occasions that, rather than denigrating this as an outlook for the Australian economy, we should be reflecting on the fact that we in Australia are doing rather better than practically every other OECD country. The point I find so difficult to comprehend so far as the Opposition's position is concerned is that it homes in on those aspects which it thinks bolsters its case for a depressed economy, an economy which it says persists in this state, when on all of the evidence the Australian economy is performing comparatively well compared with other economies around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that Mr Bush, as he moves towards the presidential election, would much rather be defending our growth prospects than his own. I am quite sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain would have had a much easier time of it at the recent Conservative conference had he been defending our prospects for economic growth than his own, which continue to foresee negative growth in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the evidence that suggests that the assessment we provided at Budget time was somehow wrong? Where is the evidence to suggest that we have, as claimed by the Deputy Leader, gilded the lily as far as our growth estimates are concerned? It is perhaps worth taking the views of those who make their living out of forecasting the economy, giving advice to people about where they think the economy is going. If we look at those people in Australia who operate in that way we find that almost all of them, if not all of them, have growth forecasts in excess of those that were included in the Budget. Mr Fiedler at AMP suggests that 4.3 would have been a better figure; Jeff Schubert, 3.5; John Stroud, 4.3; Nicki Hutley, 3.5; Chris Caton, 4.2; Grant Bailey, 3.8; and so it goes on, with the average of all of those forecasters, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> in June of this year, being 3.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore it was not surprising that in the period immediately after the Budget there was a view that, if anything, the Government had erred on the cautious side as far as prospects for economic growth were concerned. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a big point about the fact that the world economy is not growing very fast. That is precisely the same point that I have been making when I have said that the Australian economy is growing faster than most of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the developed part of the world is growing slowly; and we are not going to have that part of the world economy pulling the Australian economy through to more rapid rates of growth. But, of course, this is not something that has struck us just in the last couple of weeks; it is something with which we have been familiar for some time. We have seen the reports of the OECD. We have seen that the OECD has been progressively revising downwards its estimates of world economic activity. But we were aware of this circumstance when we put together our Budget estimates in the course of July and early August. So this is not something which has just struck us, even if it has just struck the Opposition or if some other commentators around the world have just become aware of this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the world economy is growing slowly. In some countries their economies will not grow but will continue to shrink, and some of the earlier forecasts of growth are being revised downwards. But that is not automatically a reason why, just a few weeks after having made our estimates of Australia's rate of growth, we should be revising ours down. The quite empty and mischievous assertions that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made, alleging that I have received advice, which I am keeping a secret, that in fact there is a case for revising down our estimates of growth in Australia, are simply not true. I have received no such advice, although I have received assessments that some of the earlier published assessments of world economic activity will not be achieved. But there is nothing new about that; we were already aware of that. We were already aware that some of the published data of the IMF and OECD was unlikely to be achieved, and that was factored into the estimates that we made for our Budget a month or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just repeat the point that in the Budget Papers it was indicated that the sources of growth in the Australian economy should be private consumption, housing and public investment, while the rural sector and private investment should begin to make a contribution in the course of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it would not be surprising if some of the sources of the composition of growth did vary somewhat in the course of the year. But the aggregate growth forecasts remain unchanged because, whilst the evidence on the retail side has been a little less encouraging, the evidence on the housing side has been more encouraging. So these factors tend to balance each other out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about all this is that the sources of growth in the Australian economy during this financial year are largely going to have a domestic orientation. It is because of that, because we realised that we could do something about spurring Australian economic growth, that we decided to provide the fiscal stimulus that we provided in the Budget, on top of what had already been provided in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). But, intriguingly, members of the Opposition are now saying that the prospects for Australian growth will be less than we forecast in the Budget. Are they still sticking to their absurd proposition that we should not be providing the fiscal stimulus responsibly provided within this Budget in order to promote economic recovery?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that they cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that it was irresponsible to provide that fiscal stimulus&mdash;and, indeed, on their say-so, they would reduce the Budget deficit and therefore the fiscal stimulus by some $6 billion or $7 billion; that is their prescription&mdash;and then say that, in fact, the economy is growing slower than it should be. The very consequence of the policy which they are advocating is one of very much slower growth and very much higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate that we are having about the prospects for the Australian economy it ought to be made very clear where the Government stands and where the Opposition stands. The Government stands on the side of providing in a responsible way a stimulus from the Budget to promote a recovery which will not be excessive. In other words, it will be a sustainable one. It will be sustainable because inflation is low and can be maintained low. This is largely because we have a wages policy dedicated towards maintaining low levels of inflation, with inflation at or below the level of our trading partners. On top of that, we are providing the kind of stimulus from the Budget which would ensure that the economy grows more rapidly than otherwise and would ensure that we are doing everything we can to improve the economic prospects for the nation and the prospects for individuals in Australia, particularly those who are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Opposition advocates a slower growing economy, one that would have only half the stimulus. Those opposite would actually fight against the automatic adjustments which occur in the Budget when the economy slows down. They would fight against that. They would drive the economy not faster into recovery but into reverse; that is, back into recession. They would probably create unemployment in excess of an additional 120,000 people as a result of their policy. On top of that, they would pursue policies which would see the inflation rate go up, not down. They have no policy instruments on the wages side to deal with that, other than high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear, beyond all of the nonsense which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got up and speculated about today, what their prescription actually is. Their policy is to return the economy to recession&mdash;to do that by reducing the fiscal stimulus and then to increase inflation by the introduction of their consumption tax; then, in order to contain the inflationary impact and to try to ensure that it does not get into wages, to increase interest rates; therefore, further stifling the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said in January that under his policies he foresees a decade of despair and a decade of recession. He thinks that Australia is entirely at the whim of the rest of the world, whereas we see there are things that can be done by this country and things which we have already done to try to stimulate economic growth&mdash;not economic growth which is unsustainable but economic growth which is about the average level of that of our trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old-fashioned view of the Opposition has come through very clearly in this debate, because those opposite think that what is happening in the industrialised world, particularly Europe and North America, determines our fate. They ought to wake up. They ought to realise that more and more of the determinants of our economic fortunes live just to our north in those rapidly growing economies in Asia. We have set about trying to reorient our trade towards those economies so that we can have this higher rate of growth than some of the more stodgy, industrialised countries were able to achieve this year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened now? He is in exactly the same position but this time he is in the reverse stage, of trying hard to hang on to his job. He has only just got there and he is walking out because he is about to lose it&mdash;bye, bye blackbird. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is fascinating, is it not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the circumstances of Australia are concerned, this debate is not about what the Opposition is saying, it is what the third most senior member of the Keating Government says. He is not even inferior in Cabinet hierarchy to the Treasurer; it is the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. What did he say? He was not out there giving, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said, an off-the-cuff sort of remark; he gave a considered response to a deliberate question which was prepared not at the moment but as a result of his being out and working in the business world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people think it was something that the business world does not really consider, they might remember what John Ralph, who is the incoming Chairman of the Business Council and previously Chairman of the Business Council's economic and financial panel, said immediately after the Budget was released. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievement of the Budget targets is dependent upon achieving the GDP growth of 3.0% assumed in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, John Ralph and the business community see that 3 per cent growth figure as absolutely fundamental; without it, the whole of the Budget falls apart. That is what this debate is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, in a considered response, said that he did not believe the numbers. That is pretty serious stuff. This morning the Treasurer, in his response to the comments made by Senator Button on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, has tried to say, `John Button got it wrong' and `I don't know what John Button was about'. The Treasurer has made all sorts of derogatory comments about John Button. One of those statements that Senator Button has become famous for over the years is that it was `entirely on his own'. Come off it&mdash;`entirely on his own'?  Is Senator Button, the third most senior member of the Government, not privy to the financial consultations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, in answer to the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a while ago during Question Time, said no, he hadn't had any advice but there had been discussions. What is the difference between discussions with Treasury and advice from Treasury? The reality is that all the fundamentals suggest that the growth data included in the Budget is not going to be achieved. Let me give the House a few of these fundamentals identified by David Clark this morning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. They are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full-time jobs fell 0.5 per cent in August, resuming their downwards trend, while the unemployment rate continues to trend upwards and the rise in part-time jobs suggests that any eventual pick-up in full-time ones will not be as great as in previous recoveries.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already heard from the Treasurer during his speech how fundamental unemployment is in the United States. How fundamental is it here?  The Government is trying to forget about that long term downward trend in unemployment. It is not possible to marry a long term downward trend in unemployment with a growth projection of 3 per cent. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pre-tax company profits fell 5 per cent over the June quarter, with only wholesale and retail profits showing a recovery . . . The trend estimate of turnover for retail and selected service establishments rose in July. However, the monthly rate of increase has been diminishing since March.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, they rose slowly but generally at a lower and lower level. We are getting a contracting base in retail spending. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New motor vehicle registrations remain very flat . . . non-residential building . . . continues to decline . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credit advanced by our financial institutions is still lower than a year ago.</PARA>
<PARA>They are just a few of the basic indicators. This is not about the Opposition and the Government, it is about the Government not having a policy and the panic button being identified by the man who bears that name. If people thought that there was something different about our assessment that the growth projections might be somewhat dubious, I will take them to an assessment of the growth projections over the last eight Budgets. It is interesting to note that not one of them has been correct. Four of them have been higher; four of them have been lower. The higher have been as much as 1.6 per cent higher, and the lower have been as much as 1.4 per cent lower. In 1990-91 they were 4.1 per cent instead of the 5.3 per cent assessed. In 1991-92 they were 3.1 per cent instead of the 3.5 per cent assessed. Why should we in 1992-93, when all those other factors are there to suggest that they cannot be attained, not see that the figure is likely to be less than 3 per cent?  That is what John Button was saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make no mistake about it, this debate is not about us saying to the Government `Look, we think your policies are wrong', or trying to identify some failing in the Treasury or the Budget itself. It is not us; it is the third most senior member of the Government saying that it has got it wrong. What is this all about? I put it to the House that it is something a little more fundamental than just the falling apart of the figures in the Budget. It is really about the falling apart of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button is not the only person from the Hawke camp who has given projections in the last few weeks which are quite contrary to those the Treasurer would have us believe. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)&mdash;we know he is no great friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); nor the Prime Minister of him&mdash;warned us on 8 October that `unemployment would not fall notably before the end of 1992'. We heard the Treasurer today and last week telling us that unemployment was going to fall below 10 per cent by the middle of next year. His Minister for Employment, Education and Training is either getting briefings from a different source or he knows what it is about. The reality is that unemployment is still trending to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one which fascinated me was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). We all know that he is not exactly a great friend of the Prime Minister; nor the reverse. He said last week that the average broad-acre farmer was forecast to lose $25,700 this financial year&mdash;proof that the rural recession continues. There we have it. We have somebody&mdash;one of the `friends' of the Prime Minister&mdash;identifying that things will continue to be bad in the rural recession; we have another `friend' of the Prime Minister telling us that unemployment will be down; and we have the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce telling us that the growth projections are not likely to be met. This is really quite fundamental to the capacity of the Government to govern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that the Government has also forgotten one of the other fundamental factors. We heard about the embroidery&mdash;as the Prime Minister likes to call it&mdash;and about how the fiscal stimulus of which the Treasurer boasts in the Budget will ensure that we get the growth rate the Government has projected. I point out to him that over the last four years business investment has fallen. This Budget predicts a further decline of 2 per cent in business investment. As far as John Ralph and the Business Council of Australia are concerned, they have said that they expect that business investment will fall more than twice that. I do not think that bodes very well for the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that, faced with this dilemma and crisis, all the Treasurer can do is talk about fiscal stimulus and yesterday's figures and try to defend a number that is indefensible. The reality is that not only is the number indefensible but so also is the policy of the Government. While it continues to project uncertainty and doubt about its capacity to provide solutions, what do honourable members think is happening out there? There is a real climate of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found a statement by the Prime Minister at Barcaldine yesterday. There is not doubt that even he, when he gets out in the real world, finds how doubt and uncertainty plague the average Australian. There is no doubt that he has to accept, as he said yesterday, that there is a `real problem' for his Government and he has brought a lot of suffering to people. It is no use his turning to the same `spirit of experimentation' that united Australia in the midst of drought and depression a century ago. That is not the basis for recovery in 1992. The basis for recovery in 1992 is to get rid of the present Government and introduce some positive policies. I suggest that the Government might start by looking at Fightback. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to follow the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Of course, it is only the internal politics of the Opposition that keep the honourable member on the back bench; obviously, if there were some genuine reward for people on the basis of ability the right honourable member would not be on the back bench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although he made a spirited contribution to the debate, the basic essence of his argument was totally flawed. The Budget forecast of 3  per cent is a modest one. It is a forecast tha is sustainable and I think will be borne out. We have already seen in the last year growth of 1.6 per cent. It does not mean that there has to be a great acceleration in growth for that Budget forecast of 3 per cent to be met. Indeed, a number of economic indicators and forecasters have put the view that that Budget forecast is right on line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Market Insights</EMPHASIS>, the most recent publication produced by Westpac, which honourable members would have received in their rooms today. A flick through that document indicates that Westpac&mdash;Australia's largest bank and, I would have thought, an organisation that could claim some sort of background in making financial predictions&mdash;forecasts that economic growth will be 4 per cent by the end of next year. In fact, that is even higher than the Budget forecasts we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the basis of the Budget forecast? The Budget forecast was not built on some sort of concept that we will have a booming world economy and Australia will be dragged out of its slow economic path by the world economy. It was based on the assumption that economic growth throughout the world would be slow and that the United States, Japan and Europe as a whole would be going through a period of subdued growth. That is the whole basis of the Budget strategy. It is because Australia is in a period of slow growth that the Government considered it appropriate to go through a process of public infrastructure work and expand the Budget deficit so that there was an increase in local demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point of this debate&mdash;not whether Senator Button changed his mind and later that day retracted his statement made on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. The fact is that Senator Button's initial statement was wrong. He was overly pessimistic and he corrected that through a statement he issued later that day. The real debate we should be concentrating on is: what are the policies that will help Australia? The major concern in my electorate is not what Senator Button is uttering; people want to know what will happen about employment, the basics of government services, health, education, and what sort of future they will have for themselves and their kids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Budget should be all about; it should be about tackling those major problems. That is what this Budget is about and that is what that growth forecast is all about. It is about putting together a series of policies that will ensure that Australia has a reasonable level of growth that is sustainable for our economic conditions. That is why we have put in place a series of expansions in public infrastructure. That is why both the One Nation statement and the Budget concentrate on road building, the Australian rail network, and the education system through the development of TAFE. That is why it is a Budget that is appropriate for the circumstances in which Australia finds itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast&mdash;and we were urged by the right honourable member for New England to make a contrast&mdash;we have an Opposition promoting its Fightback policies. The right honourable member for New England said that the Government should have a look at Fightback. One would assume from the nature of this debate that the whole basis of what the Opposition is saying is, `Look, we can do better. We can supply better growth through out forecasts.' That is an interesting concept and I think we should look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> recently conducted a survey of some 37 leading Australian economists. They were asked a series of questions about the prospects for various economic conditions under the Government's program in the One Nation statement and the Budget as opposed to the policies outlined by the Opposition in Fightback. It went through a series of questions about economic performance as predicted by these 37 leading economists under both sets of policies. The first question they were asked was obviously about growth, and that is what the debate is about today. The question posed to the 37 economists was: will growth be higher at the end of the next three-year term under the coalition or under Labor? Some eight of the economists predicted that growth would be better under the coalition and 24 of the country's leading economists predicted that growth would be higher under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it does not end there. We turn to unemployment. Which party, according to Australia's leading economists, has the policies in place that will be best for unemployment? Thirteen economists nominated that the Opposition's policies would lead to higher unemployment and only four believed that would be the outcome under Labor. Clearly, the economists believe that Labor will have a better record of tackling unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about inflation? Nineteen economists out of this group predicted that inflation would be higher under the coalition than it would be under Labor; only 13 believed it would be higher under Labor. What about interest rates&mdash;a vital issue for my electorate and for the electorates of many honourable members. It is an important issue for many first home buyers and people throughout Australia who are in the home market at the moment. In fact, housing is one sector of the economy which is performing strongly. It is one sector which is leading to a fair amount of growth in the Australian economy. What would be the impact of the Opposition's policies as opposed to the Government's policies on interest rates? Some 23 of the country's leading economists surveyed believed that interest rates would be higher over the next three years under a coalition government while only six contended that interest rates would be higher under Labor's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a fairly damning assessment by 37 of Australia's leading economists: first, they predicted that growth would be higher under the Government's policies; second, that unemployment would be lower under the Government's policies; third, that inflation would be lower under the Government's policies; and, fourth, that interest rates would be considerably higher under the policies being promoted by the Opposition. </PARA>

One does not have to be a leading economist to come to that same conclusion. What is the basic assumption of the Opposition's proposals? The whole basis of Fightback is to withdraw something like $5 billion to $6 billion from government spending. I see that the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) is nodding and conceding that that is an important part of the Opposition's program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to be a leading economist or a genius to work out that, if we are in a period of very slow growth, if we are in a period of sluggish demand, and something like $6 billion is drawn out of the economy through government slashing its programs, people will lose their jobs. This involves not just public servants losing their jobs, although obviously large numbers would do that; it takes in all of the things which government purchases from Australian business. The Federal Government alone purchases something like $10 billion worth of goods and services annually from Australian businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is talking about kicking the guts out of Australian business by withdrawing demand at the very time that&mdash;by its own argument&mdash;it is saying that growth is weak in this country, that the economic conditions are not conducive to continuing strong growth, and that we are looking at a period of uncertainty in terms of the economic conditions and the world economy. Yet, after conceding all of those points, after saying that it believed that the growth forecast&mdash;and it is making the argument&mdash;should be weak, its prescription is not to try to do something to counteract that; it is to reduce the size of government and not do the sorts of public infrastructure works that the Government has put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition knows&mdash;and the economists in this survey also confirm it&mdash;that that would mean lower growth, higher unemployment, higher inflation and higher interest rates under the Liberals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time allowed for the discussion of Estimates there are not many matters that I am able to raise in the area of the environment, so I am going to confine myself to two specific matters and then make some more general comments about the administration of the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. The first matter I want to raise is one of very great conservation significance. It is quite a specific matter; that is, the control of the weed pest mimosa pigra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a substantial infestation of mimosa near Oenpelli in Arnhem Land. Mimosa is one of the most significant weed pests in northern Australia. It has a severe impact on Top End wetlands and spreads very quickly if not controlled. The significance of the problem is such that mimosa was the only weed specifically mentioned by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in his `Our Country, Our Future' statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last financial year, the Commonwealth provided $2m to control an isolated 8,000 hectare infestation near Oenpelli, which is also close to Kakadu. The problem involves significant local Aboriginal employment. Follow-up herbicide treatment of the entire area was planned this year at a projected cost of $1.2m to prevent regrowth and give competitive plants a chance re-establish in the area. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this year's Federal Budget contained no commitment to continue the program and it is proving quite difficult&mdash;as I am informed by the Northern Territory Government&mdash;to secure a firm commitment from the Federal Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). It is a bit hard to work out why this was left out of the Budget. It could have been just a mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have actually looked at the problem on the ground. The matter is very serious. The mimosa is like a bush that grows to shoulder height or a bit higher. Once it has taken over an area, it is not possible for animals to move through it. It kills off everything else in the surrounding area. It is moving across Arnhem Land, and it threatens Kakadu. Unless there is a very determined program of eradication, it could take over vast areas of land in northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and, possibly, Western Australia. It is a serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real problem&mdash;this is a very practical matter and I am not making the point in a political way&mdash;is that a lot of money has been sunk into the program to date. There is a lot of Aboriginal employment involved in the follow-up part of the program. If the money is not available to continue the herbicide treatment, all the efforts to date will be lost. I ask the Minister to look closely at this matter. Somebody from the Minister's office has said that the money will be available, but it has not been possible for the Northern Territory conservation Minister to get a firm commitment from the Federal Minister, so I would like the Minister to look closely at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to mention involves the huskies in Antarctica and the Department's Antarctic program. When the negotiations were proceeding for the protocol to the Antarctic treaty to preserve the environment of the Antarctic, which was signed in Madrid on 4 October 1991, there was a requirement not to introduce exotic animal species to the territory. There was also a requirement to move out the huskies that were already there by a date in 1994. This has been a matter of considerable concern to those who have worked with the huskies in the Antarctic. The scientists and support staff who have spent a considerable amount of time down there have worked with these dogs over many years. The dogs themselves have been an integral part of the research program. Also, they sometimes provide a safer means of transport around the bases than vehicles do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people supporting the retention of the huskies in the Antarctic do not challenge the fact that eventually they will need to be phased out under this agreement, but they do object to the decision of the Minister that within about one month they will have to be moved to a site in Minnesota in the United States&mdash;a completely alien environment. This has caused an outcry from those who have worked closely with the huskies in the Antarctic over many years. As honourable members can imagine, it is a very emotional subject for them, and it is a matter for which one can have a great deal of sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been following this matter up as best I can, and I have some new information.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"At Rothera BAS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the British Antarctic Survey&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has 20 huskies, all born in the Antarctic, and they include 5 young pups. By the summer of 1993-94 only 14 will remain due to the age factor. Of these, 7 will be 7 years of age (at the end of their working life), 2 will be 6 years of age (past major expedition age) and 5 will be 3 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation of the ban on huskies, BAS stopped all breeding in 1990. No huskies will be removed from Antarctica by the UK and all the present animals will be allowed to live their natural active life-span in the only environment the dogs know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BAS recognises the very important role huskies have played in the heritage of Antarctica and continue to play in maintaining the morale and excitement of an Antarctic base. Winter journeys with huskies have provided the most testing times for the mountaineers whose summer occupation is to assist scientists collect data safely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Britain is therefore committed to removing dogs currently in the Antarctic, by means of phasing out the British huskies by natural means. The deadline of April 1994 contained in Annex II to the Environmental Protocol (which will only enter into force after ratification by all Parties) is not considered a legally binding constraint at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a perfectly sensible way of handling this matter. The Minister has indicated, in response to representations, that it was absolutely vital to agree to the removal of the huskies quickly in order to get the environment protocol signed. The Minister has put a very high political price on this. Generally speaking, the advice we are getting from the British and from others is that that really was unnecessary; it was a relatively minor part of the whole deal. We think she is going too far and we ask her to reconsider that decision and not to send these dogs to Minnesota, where they would be in an alien environment, but to leave them as the British have&mdash;to stop them breeding and let them live out their lives where they have already spent all of their time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is perhaps a more political one. There is a very strong pattern in the Minister's activities in this Department of giving conservation groups some kind of indication that their demands will be met&mdash;to a great extent, knowing that those promises are undeliverable&mdash;and subsequently backing down. This has happened in lots of ways. It has happened, very broadly, with the promises that were made in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter, has pointed out that the Labor Party has broken over half of the 71 promises it gave to the Greens in the last election. There is a great deal of disappointment about that. There was the environmental kit for schools, which was rather an extreme publication catering to the more extreme areas of the green movement. That was subsequently withdrawn. It was an absolute fiasco. There was the Benders Cave incident and, most recently, there was the Endangered Species Protection Bill&mdash;a Bill which had no chance of getting through Cabinet colleagues but which was put up as an apparent gesture to the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens do not appreciate this kind of behaviour. It is a very erratic way for a senior Minister to behave. It certainly is not appreciated by anyone with a deep interest in the environment, including people from the various conservation groups. I am getting a lot of feedback that this type of behaviour on the part of the Minister is not appreciated. I will be raising those matters in other forums as best I can. This is a matter of grave concern to the Opposition and, I believe, to the green movement, to the conservation movement and also to this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this portfolio debate I want to discuss the excellent level of funding for sport that the Commonwealth Government has given over past years. I refer especially to that announced recently by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I then want to contrast that significant Commonwealth support for sport in Australia with what the Opposition proposes, which is not only a cut in the level of Commonwealth support for sport and recreation in this country but also loading onto ordinary sports men and women the impact of a goods and services tax, which will make everything from registering as a player going into a competition and travelling the country to buying footy shorts and socks more expensive and thus make sport a not easily obtained option for Australians. As Australians, we have become used to being easily able to engage in sport. It is a right of all Australians to participate, to become active and to be able to get into sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister announced in this year's Budget that the Commonwealth Government will provide $83m for sport and recreation in 1992-93. Of that $83m, the Australian Sports Commission will receive $59.6m this year and a similar amount in each of the next three years. This means the continuation and enhancement of existing programs for elite athletes, existing programs for the support of national sporting organisations and, consistent with a balanced approach to sports development, new and enhanced programs for sports participation. It means that the Government's commitment amounts to some $293m over the next four years. That compares with $217m during the previous four years, which marks a 35 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any doubt that there is a direct relationship between the amount of support the Commonwealth gives and the success that Australian sports men and women have had in international play over the past couple of years. I want to congratulate a woman from my electorate, Lisa McShea, who is the current junior Wimbledon doubles title holder; she also made the quarter finals in junior Wimbledon singles some months ago. Lisa is from the city of Redcliffe in my electorate and I had the pleasure of playing tennis with her on the courts here at Parliament House just a couple of weeks ago. We played doubles and she very sensibly chose me as her partner. Of course we won&mdash;although I will not give honourable members the score. She is a good player and is now well advanced on a career. She is rated about 400 in the world already. This is an 18-year-old from my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has been able to get such a good start because she has a Commonwealth scholarship; she has support from the taxpayer to pursue her career. She is based at the Australian Institute of Sport and has to spend much time and money out of the country circulating and competing. I congratulate Lisa and I congratulate the Commonwealth Government for the support it gives to Lisa. In a sense, she will become an ambassador for Australia. She is a delightful individual, and her great talent and skills mean that the name of Australia is being made all over the tennis courts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast that, though, with the miserly attitude the Opposition has to the support of sport in Australia. Senator Baume, who is the Opposition spokesperson on sport, has said that the Opposition has promised to cut $17m from the sport and recreation budget. That will affect adversely a lot of top class sports men and women in Australia. In addition to the cutting of expenditure that the Opposition wants to go on with, unfortunately its figures do not add up, and we need to put this on the record. The Opposition claims that $3m a year would be cut from the capital spending of the Australian Institute of Sport. The problem there is that the capital expenditure in 1992-93 is estimated at just $1.2m. We cannot cut $3m out of a total expenditure of $1.2m. So Senator Baume should go back and do his figures again. I do not want him to cut one penny out of sports administration funding in this country, but if he is going to go on about that sort of nonsense, he should get his figures right in the first place, for goodness' sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume also wants to cut $4m from what he calls administration costs. Unfortunately, he does not understand that a lot of the significant programs of the Australian Institute of Sport are written up as administration costs. For example, if he cuts $4m out of expenditure here, things such as sports science, medicine and information programs, the Australian Coaching Council and other aspects of the Institute programs are also going to be cut. So Senator Baume is not fiddling about making the administration of sport in Australia more efficient; he is cutting to the bone important programs that will affect the progress of our best Australian sports men and women. He should not deny it; that is what will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also wants to knock about one of our most successful programs, the community cultural recreation and sports facilities program, which has enabled millions of dollars to be spent specifically at a local level on sports facilities. Senator Baume should come up to my electorate and tell my cricket players at Aspley and Albany Creek, my clay target shooters in Clontarf, my hockey players in Redcliffe, and even the amateur fishermen up on the Redcliffe Peninsula, that they cannot have the facilities that we, the Commonwealth, have built for them over the past couple of years. They would not have those facilities in my electorate to make cricket, tennis, clay target shooting, fishing and all the rest such a joy if the Opposition were in government. It would cut the sorts of programs that put bricks and mortar on the ground for the enjoyment of Australian sports men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is an enormous contrast with what we believe is money well spent through the Commonwealth's support of recreation and sport and the Opposition wanting to cut those funds away. In addition, if the Opposition were to impose a goods and services tax it would have an enormous impact on people's ability to afford sport and recreation and also on their ability to administer sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take the Committee through some of the impacts of a GST on sport. Think about the increased cost of actually playing a game were a GST to be introduced. First of all, registration fees for sporting clubs, which are not currently taxed, would have a 15 per cent GST on top of them. Entry fees, which are not currently taxed, would have a 15 per cent GST whacked on them. Admission charges to games and so on, which are not currently taxed, would have a 15 per cent GST bunged on them. All the uniforms&mdash;socks, tracksuits and shorts&mdash;</PARA>

I know the argument about taking tax out of it, but these are things that are not currently taxed and they will suffer the imposition of a 15 per cent goods and services tax. Tracksuits, shorts, jumpers, socks and boots will be taxed at least 11 or 12 per cent more, deducting the sorts of taxes that are already imposed on those goods at the moment, and a full 15 per cent where there are no current taxes on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coaching courses, because they are not currently taxed, would suffer the full 15 per cent imposition. Travel to tournaments and championships would suffer from the further imposition of a tax. In addition, accommodation costs will increase. Members of sporting clubs go away; I used to do a great deal of travel as a hockey player. My parents would have to come up with the $300 or $400 to send little Gary away for a week to play hockey in New South Wales. It will now cost 15 per cent or whatever more in net terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an idiotic situation it is when the Opposition not only withdraws direct government finance for these people but also begins to tax sports men and women in Australia. The treasurer of an amateur sporting club works his little tail off all year long just to get all the facts and figures together. He would have to become a tax collecting agent for the purposes of collecting the GST and passing it on to the Australian Taxation Office. The poor old treasurer would have to put in an enormous amount of time, effort and knowledge just to run the dinky local sporting club. It will be more difficult to administer, more expensive to play, and the Commonwealth Government will not help out. There are three different ways in which sport will be cruelled in this country if that mob ever gets in. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

So, like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and many others, he is resorting to scare tactics as the only means of defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), in the course of his remarks a few minutes ago spoke about a major problem in the tropics that is confronting us all, the problem of mimosa pigra. Having been a member and deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts for six or seven years, I know that we have been confronted with a major problem. As the shadow Minister has indicated&mdash;and I know the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is also very concerned about it&mdash;it is a very serious problem. The shadow Minister said mimosa pigra grows only to about shoulder height; in fact, in many areas it is over 12 feet high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a major headache at the moment for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service in the Northern Territory. It is able to engage only in a control exercise. Very importantly, a lot of work is being done with regard to biological control, which is one of the newer ways of coming to grips with some of these exotic problems that we have in our nation and that other nations have. We remember coming to grips with the problem of rabbits, by the introduction of myxomatosis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far some progress has been made with regard to mimosa pigra in the form of biological experiments. The larvae of a moth that has been introduced now penetrate the stem and are able to reduce the productivity of seeds by 60 per cent. This is a very pleasing advance in the control of that very serious problem&mdash;and the seriousness cannot be underestimated&mdash;of that exotic weed in the Northern Territory. That still leaves 40 per cent of seeds being spread around and that, in itself, is still creating a very vast problem. I probably would be fairly safe in saying that the Government is very concerned about it as well, and I encourage those opposite to pay particular attention to what is a very serious problem. I have been to see it three or four times and I have been amazed at the progress that is being made in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other areas that concern me is that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts tables reports from time to time. One of the most recent reports is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biodiversity: The contribution of community-based programs</EMPHASIS>. We tabled that in June, along with another report on the moving pictures inquiry, which is a full scale inquiry into the Australian film industry. I believe that a number of recommendations in the biodiversity report, which were emphasised at the time of tabling the report, ought to have been taken notice of in the preparation of the current Budget. Recommendation 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that funding for the STB program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the save the bush program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be immediately increased to $5m in recognition of its vital contribution in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes and in the implementation of the proposed national biodiversity strategy and the Decade of Landcare, and that funding be increased to $10m by 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that funding for the OBT program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the one billion trees program&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be increased to $6m to provide additional resources for the implementation of aspects of program development identified in recommendations 6 and 7.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 6 and 7 pointed to the need to develop national standards for revegetation programs, the collection and storage of indigenous native plant seed and the protection and maintenance of eco-adapted seed stock. The recommendations also included that regional seed banks or seed orchards be established at a local or district level under these guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The save the bush program was identified as the most vital program in maintaining biodiversity&mdash;a very serious point at issue in the discussions taking place today&mdash;outside national parks and reserves, yet its funding represents less than 3 per cent of the decade of Landcare funds. Increased funds for either of these programs were not identified in the Budget at all, which is a very disturbing feature of the current appropriations about which we are talking. I reiterate the importance of these programs in community conservation initiatives and recommend the Government consider increased funding for the programs as well as implementing other recommendations made by the Committee in that report. It is a report that has gone right around the nation and has received wide acclaim from all the people who know what proper research and so on are being done on the environment and biodiversity in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that worry me about these reports is that committees go to an awful lot of trouble. When parliament is not sitting, honourable members have to travel all over the country. A lot of expense is incurred in thoroughly undertaking public hearings and looking very carefully into these difficulties. We have many local discussions with the people at the coalface who really know what is going on in these areas. We produce these reports and the Government has a declared policy of responding to them within three months. When I looked through the record book earlier today, I noted that the report on hazardous chemicals, which was tabled in December 1982, was responded to in November 1991. That was not a three-month period. Admittedly, it was a pretty important report; nevertheless, the time to consider it was really quite dreadful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of reports have not been responded to within the three-month period. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protection of the Greater Daintree</EMPHASIS> report was tabled in August 1984. The report on tourism in the Antarctic was tabled in May 1989. The report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism in the Indian Ocean Territories</EMPHASIS> was tabled in August 1990. As I said, the report on the moving pictures inquiry was tabled in June, which is more than three months ago. This biodiversity report, with so many very important recommendations for the Government, has not been taken up in a response from the Government. What is more worrying is that, despite the requests for additional funding for the save the bush program and the one billion trees program, there was no mention in the Budget of these very important recommendations to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend again this report to the Minister and her staff. I ask that very serious consideration be given to the recommendations in that report. They are vital recommendations and something should be done about taking very special notice of them, particularly the recommendations for increased funding, not substantial funding, especially for the save the bush program. The funding needs to be granted immediately so that we can continue with these very important programs that are coming to grips with this problem in our community. </PARA>

It gives me the opportunity to not only clearly enunciate the Government's commitment to sport but also indicate that, as ever, the Opposition is somewhat narky when it comes to its professed support for a number of programs in which the Commonwealth Government has a legitimate role. It is the Oppositions's policy that it will cut funding for sport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the last speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), extolling the virtues of one of the Government's environmental programs and calling for increased funding. It is amazing how many members of the Opposition, when given the opportunity, stand up in this place and seek additional funding for programs which this Government has put in place, yet in their own <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document we find that those programs will be either cut or totally eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted about this Budget allocation for sport, because as a government we are maintaining the momentum of the allocation of funds for sport which we started some three years ago. Honourable members will recall that, as a result of two parliamentary committee inquiries into sports funding and administration, which were undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which at the time I had the honour to chair, we made substantial recommendations which the Government of the day, particularly the then Minister for Sport, Senator Richardson, acted on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw then was a commitment by this Government to sports funding. We saw a commitment which recognised that the Commonwealth had a legitimate role to play in the funding of elite sport, the Australian Sports Commission and Australia's international athletes to compete overseas. It was also recognised that the Commonwealth had a legitimate role to play in putting in place programs such as Aussie Sport and to build the participation base of women in the community, and so on. We saw a major increase in the allocation of funds to sport over three successive Budgets. Now it is the turn of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). She has been able to argue most persuasively with our Cabinet colleagues and we have seen the total sport Budget for the next four years increased by 34 per cent; a grand total of $293m is going to be expended over that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might ask, `Why sport? Why do we need the allocation of Commonwealth funds for sport?'. Simply because if we can encourage a healthy lifestyle and role models in the form of elite athletes who go to the Commonwealth Games, or participate in Ironmen or Ironwomen competitions, or in netball that is now televised and so on, then we are developing role models, encouraging young people in Australia to participate in sport and that has beneficial effects not only for their health, but also for government expenditure on things such as health. If people have a healthier lifestyle, then the call in later life for hospitalisation, medical treatment and so on is lessened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to maintaining the momentum in sports funding over the next four years is certainly to be commended. I am delighted to see that the elite programs&mdash;mainly through the AIS and athlete assistance, which were recommended in those two sports funding inquiries&mdash;I recommended are now also increased by a billion dollars. I am also delighted to see that the funding for the Aussie Sport and the participation program is up by $2m to $7.5m over the next 12 months. There is also an increased allocation for drugs testing. All of those would be welcomed by most members of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disturbed me greatly when I heard the shadow spokesman for the arts, heritage and sport, Senator Michael Baume, in a radio broadcast on the ABC in the Illawarra some months ago.

She went on very adroitly to point out that the program which our Government, the Keating Government, has put in place is in stark contrast to Senator Baume's own policy which promises to cut Sports Commission funding by $7m. Any sensible person would be able to tell those opposite that cutting $7m from a budget of just under $60m must mean cuts to programs. As the Minister said, to pretend otherwise is simply foolish. That does not even beg the question of what will happen to sports funding and to sports clubs under the proposals enunciated in Fightback for the GST.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) made some very telling points on that in his contribution earlier this afternoon. Quite clearly it is a very important issue that any sports loving person&mdash;whether he be a participant or simply somebody who enjoys sport and watching it&mdash;will have to consider in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that last year the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) talked about the effect that the GST would have on the average family&mdash;a husband, wife and two children&mdash;going to the footy match. When we add the 15 per cent to the cost of the train ride to get there, the 15 per cent to the cost of the tickets to get into the outer, the 15 per cent to the cost of getting a seat in the grandstand, the 15 per cent to the ice-cream and the packet of chips at half time at the footy, the 15 per cent to the program being bought on their way home to remember the day, and the 15 per cent to the bus ride, it will cost the average person a great deal more. I think anyone who has an interest in sport would recognise that. Participants and sports associations should also consider what that will mean to the purchasing of equipment and so on. These things are all really important. I doubt very much that people would think that this will cheapen the cost of participating in sport or, indeed, anything of a sporting nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, an article picked up Senator Baume's comments on what the conservatives might do if they were in government and if he were the Minister for sport. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 4 August this year there is an article entitled `Tarnish on sport gold feared under Hewson'. It quotes a number of different people and their reaction. For example, the Confederation of Australian Sport, perhaps the leading organisation, brings together over 100 different sporting organisations. Mr Dene Moore said he doubted that, if Mr Reith became Treasurer, he would do anything for sport. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any guy that would come out with his comments in this orgy of self-congratulation that goes on around the Olympics would have to be a pretty insensitive guy, Mr Moore said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, when he was the shadow minister for sport, he was the architect of the worst sports policy ever drafted in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that just about says it all. As we know, he has moved on to be the shadow Treasurer. If he, along with Senator Baume, are the architects of the Opposition's policies for sport, then I think we are in more trouble than even the Fightback document says. I certainly commend to any person who has an interest in sport the Government's fine record in sports funding, not only in elite sport&mdash;looking after our Olympians and seeing the success that came from the most recent Olympic Games in Barcelona&mdash;but also in what has occurred in spreading the base level of support, all the programs that are generated for mass participation, such as getting after school activities going, which the Commonwealth Government supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the Minister for her persistence in ensuring that the community cultural sports and recreation facilities program is continuing to run. In my view there is a missing element in the Government's sports policy&mdash;I have said this before&mdash;that is, we need a major international or regional sports facilities program with a considerable sum of money in it so that major projects, such as basketball stadiums or improvements to major football fields and so on, can get part of the funding associated with that from the Commonwealth. At the moment that does not exist. It seems to be State or local government responsibility. It is something that we need to look at. On the whole, this again continues the fine work of the Government in sports funding. It maintains the momentum of sports funding and it addresses all the important issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week we heard the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) comment on the amount of space in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document allocated to the environment portfolio. I have no interest in talking at any great length about this matter. However, I must point out that in the Budget Speech, which we are now discussing, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia (Mr Dawkins) spent a whole four sentences, taking less than seven lines in the printed document, on the subject of the environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House we are still going through the process of trying to raise the level of debate on environmental policy. We are, by now, accustomed to this Government's policy formulation, not by mention in this House, not by debate in this House, not in the Budget Papers, but by press release to all forms of the media. I suppose we should not be too surprised by this behaviour. The hallmark of the present Government has been its total disregard for proper parliamentary process and, once more, I would urge the Minister to view the issue of the environment in its proper perspective and importance, and grant an adequate time for debate for these issues in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal interest covers all the areas of the portfolio which we are considering today. The total outlay for the portfolio is $818m, which compares with an actual outlay of $790m for the 1991-92 financial year&mdash;an increase of $28m or 3.6 per cent. In line with the genuine goodwill which has been forthcoming from the coalition on matters covered by this portfolio, there is not a lot of contention between me and the Government on many expenditure items. Indeed, it should be pointed out that the coalition has a proud record of achievement on environmental issues in office, and we have developed clear and sensible policy positions from opposition, which I am pleased to note the Government has followed from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of specific items that I wish to discuss in terms of the expenditure decisions announced in the Budget. Firstly, in the area of the arts, one can but only praise the decision to increase the staff numbers by 54 in the National Film and Sound Archive. This is an extremely valuable institution and one in which Australia has been eminent for many years. I commend the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) for having succeeded in this regard. I sincerely hope that the positions relate to conservation skills and are not just administrative or clerical positions. However, it must be remembered that the overall funding to the National Film and Sound Archive has fallen compared to last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the wider area of the arts, it should be noted that the assistance to the various areas supporting the present rebirth of quality film making and distribution has dropped in this Budget by 7 per cent from the 1991-92 Budget. This is a very disappointing figure, for in considering the interest in and the expertise shown by witnesses who appeared recently before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I would have hoped for a better deal for our film industry in this Budget. It is a real shame that senior Minister Kelly has not seen fit to follow the recommendations of the Committee's report on the moving pictures inquiry, or to consider its conclusions in her own Budget submissions, particularly as the recommendations of the inquiry were not expensive to introduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hopes that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, having ignored the report's recommendations in this Budget, can put her mind to the significant problems facing the Australian film industry, most notably in the distribution of Australian films and documentaries, particularly in Australia. Goodness knows, we have many experts who know how to work the overseas markets, but our problem is in the Australian market because of the influence of the United States international distributing giants. All members of this House should be very pleased with this success of films such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom,</EMPHASIS> which has succeeded in overseas sales, to say nothing of the domestic market for this type of film. I take this opportunity to heartily congratulate all concerned with that film and to say how thoroughly I enjoyed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One trembles at the thought of commenting on the disaster that was the environment school kit. However, it is very interesting to see inside the cover of the Minister's Budget kit that the Minister, in all her press releases, saw fit to mention the amounts being spent this financial year only on a range of programs. There is no mention of the amounts spent on those programs in the previous financial year in any of her Budget press releases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these comparisons are quite amazing. For example, subprogram 1.8 in the Budget papers on cultural heritage saw the amount provided `to enhance the development of Australian culture by increasing awareness, appreciation, preservation, and protection of Australia's cultural heritage and historic environment, especially through the national collections and information services,' reduced from $23.2m to a mere $2.7m this year. Not only this, but it should be noted that the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Australian National Gallery, the National Museum of Australia and the National Library of Australia all saw a reduction in their funding for which I have not seen any explanation from the Minister since the Budget was presented on 18 August.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this Government have any interest in cultural heritage for Australians? I would welcome hearing from the Minister as to why these reductions in funding have come about, but I regard that as a rare chance because she is not even here for her debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest the Minister might think that I am here only to criticise her, I congratulate her on the decision to increase outlays to some sections of the meteorological service by  nearly $19m. This is an area which calls for considerable investigative work. I congratulate the Minister on those increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am most disappointed in the amount of money allocated to the feral pests program to reduce the impact of feral animals such as the fox, the cat and the goat on native wildlife. I think $1.5m is a paltry amount for this type of necessary investigation. Having travelled around Australia in the last year, it is clear to me that this funding is totally inadequate. The feral pests problem presents a real challenge in the area of biodiversity but, as the Minister has not seen fit to talk to any degree in public about the issue of biodiversity, I should not think she will talk at length in this debate. In fact, I suspect that she will not talk at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of endangered species was not covered at any length in the Budget Papers. However, I cannot let this debate pass by without commenting on this important subject. What is now emerging is that the Minister has taken it upon herself to ram this legislation through her own Party. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, will be aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that an issue such as this would have warranted more responsible consultation from the Minister's Department. It is clear that many groups involved in the ecologically sustainable development process have become quite concerned at the apparent haste of the Minister regarding this legislation. As my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) said last week, why the rush? As last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS> notes, there is a lot of real concern about this draft Bill. The publication said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just on a month ago the Government released <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Australian National Strategy for the Conservation of the National Species</EMPHASIS>. An extensive program of consultation and working committees to integrate the strategy into economic planning procedures was outlined. Yet within a month an 86 page Bill was circulated to Ministers `Providing for the conservation and management of the species'.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Government's process of consultation on such an important matter has lasted for the grand total of one month. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Canberra</EMPHASIS> publication went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry claims that no meaningful consultation with likely affected parties, including other Government departments, has been undertaken by Ros Kelly or her Department. Industry reaction to the legislation is that it is flawed, is based on United States legislation which has been shown to cost jobs, is ineffective in saving endangered species, is costly to administer, and promotes community conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the reactions of industry to a proposed Bill. For my own part, I do not wish to comment further because I have not had the privilege of seeing the proposed legislation. The Minister has said that we will know the progress of the Bill after it has been to Cabinet. However, I would like to reiterate my concerns at the apparent rush of the Minister to force through this legislation, and I hope that we may have a sensible debate on this important matter. I would like to ask Minister Kelly, at a time when the continuing tragedy of Australia's unemployment has been confirmed and as there has been an exclusion of this subject from the Budget, whether any jobs will be lost as a result of her proposed endangered species legislation. There was not a mention of it in the Budget Papers, and the Budget is only six weeks old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minute or two remaining at my disposal, I wish to correct some of the remarks that have been made in this debate by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns). The facts on funding in the Fightback proposition as regards sport are contrary to what has been said by these two Government members in this debate. No cuts whatsoever will take place in the Federal funding through the Australian Sports Commission to Australian sporting organisations. As Fightback clearly states, that funding will be maintained in real terms. Previous speakers have said that there will be a 5 per cent cut in real terms in the Australian Sports Commission's program in the latest Budget and there is to be a $40m total cut in sports funding under the Keating Government over the next three years. This is nonsense because honourable members opposite will not be here for the next three years, but that is what they said. The blatantly political $10m a year community recreation and sporting facilities program, which is administered by the Minister herself on the basis of the political status of the electorate involved without reference to or advice from the ASC, will itself be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of nonsense has been spoken about what will happen with sports. Let me say to the two previous speakers from the Labor side that I have as great an interest in sport as they have. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The estimates before us for the portfolio of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories cover a wide range of subject matter, but it is subject matter that I think most Australians could have some affinity with. It is interesting that in this afternoon's debate mention has been made of the work of a range of the committees of this Parliament that have looked into subject matter under this portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) raised the issue of the report of the House of Representatives Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Biodiversity: The contribution of community-based programs</EMPHASIS>. I have to agree with him that it is unfortunate that from time to time governments are not able to meet the three-month limit in replying to these reports. I serve on the Committee with the honourable member for Macquarie and can attest to the hard work that goes into putting the reports together. I think that, whatever government is in power, there needs to be a realisation that the parliamentary committee system is a way in which the community can feel that it has some contact with this Parliament and that it can put its views to the Parliament&mdash;views that perhaps will be listened to by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Macquarie mentioned that one of the recommendations of the report was a suggested increase in funding for programs such as the save the bush program. It has been our pleasure on that Committee to visit a number of projects that have been funded under that program&mdash;the one billion trees program and two other community programs that were the subject of the inquiry. Recently I was able to visit some projects in my electorate that have received funding under the save the bush program. I congratulate the Diamond Valley Council's natural environment protection panel, which received a modest grant to help it in its work this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of these projects is that in an urban setting where there are remnants of pristine bushland we can give examples in close proximity of the work that can be achieved under these programs. On this tour I was shown two sites that contain over 40 species of native orchids. Through the funding under the save the bush program fencing will be put in to protect these areas without necessarily cutting them off from the community. The panel envisages that in the long term these areas will be used as interpretive displays to try to inform and educate the wider community about the importance of areas that people tend to regard as being roadside reserves or just another park. It is an important program that has potential for a partnership between Commonwealth, State and local governments and community non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that has been touched upon is sports funding, and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) spoke about that. Honourable members will remember that he put down two reports when he was Chairman of the Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee. The Committee found that the Commonwealth had a role to fund elite sport but also to be a partner in assisting the other spheres of government in the provision of community facilities. Something like 50 per cent of people over 14 are involved in organised sport, with many more involved in an informal sense.  Something like 65 per cent of the population are involved as spectators and something like 96 per cent are involved by watching sport on television. So there is great interest in sport. However, those statistics also show that about 36 per cent of school age children miss out on sport. I think we have to look at that and try to address it. Programs such as Aussie Sport and other programs that try to involve children in sport are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area I wish to touch upon is library funding, and I shall go beyond the National Library, which has money put to it as part of these estimates. The second report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies dealing with Australia as an information society is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information Networks</EMPHASIS> and was tabled in this House back in September 1991. I have to agree again with the honourable member for Macquarie that it really does nobody any credit when, some 12 months later, we are still awaiting a response to this report. A number of the issues raised in the report are important and people are interested in the Government's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major recommendations of the report was that there should be put in place a national library policy; that the Minister should make a detailed statement to the Parliament about the adequacy of existing library and information networks in meeting Australia's information needs. The local public network system that services most of my electorate is the Yarra Plenty Regional Library Service. From the outset I have to admit that I have had some past involvement in that service. When I was first elected to this place I was the chairperson of the committee of management of that regional library service, so I am well acquainted with the work it does. In the past few years it has kept abreast of the types of things it envisages it can do to improve the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of its problems at the moment is that a major part of the usage of its service is curriculum-based by primary and secondary school students, with a growing proportion by post-secondary students. A consultant's report in mid-1990 showed that curriculum-based library users accounted for approximately 48 per cent of total library users using books in the library and over 55 per cent of total inquiries in the library. That is a major portion of its business, and it is something that has to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Long Term Strategies Committee recognised that and made a recommendation that the Commonwealth, through the Australian Education Council, encourage State governments to provide supplementary funding to public libraries to assist with the development of services provided for secondary students to compensate public libraries for the cross-subsidisation currently being provided to the education sector. The Yarra Plenty Library Service has taken that a step further. It is suggesting that the Commonwealth should pick up some of the deficiency in funding. As I have said to it, whilst I am not totally opposed to that notion, it is not something that is going to be decided in the short term. We will have to sit down and iron out what the shared responsibilities are going to be between spheres of government, and it is likely to take some time. As the Long Term Strategies Committee indicated, it will require a ministerial council of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Hopefully, such a council will recognise that local government plays a major role in the provision of public libraries and will invite local government to any discussions that are held. That is something we need to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be recognised that there is great pressure on library services throughout Australia because of the inability of other spheres of government to foot the bill. Because there are curriculum-based usages of these libraries, the Commonwealth Government can show some leadership by putting in place a national library policy, even in the context of what the National Library would like with a national information policy. It has long advocated the need for a national information policy, with the library being a significant portion. I hope that in the consideration of the Long Term Strategies Committee report the Government will see its way clear to show leadership and to sit down in partnership with State and local governments and other important non-government players to see how we can improve and make more efficient the national library services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to intervene in this debate as a result of contributions made by many honourable members on the other side on the issue of the impact on sport in Australia of the coalition's Fightback plan. The argument that was reiterated, if I could be tautological, again and again was that the GST would do enormous damage to the costs of people participating in or being spectators at sports events. I thought I would take the opportunity today of making some points not just about what the coalition proposes to do&mdash;that seems to be the almost total preoccupation of honourable members on the other side of the chamber, who are supposed to be the Government of Australia, not the Opposition&mdash;but about the impact of the tax policies of those opposite on sports events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just over two weeks ago at the MCG in Melbourne the AFL grand final between the West Coast Eagles and Geelong was held. Having lived in Geelong for some years, I was very disappointed that Geelong lost the game. It would be argued by honourable members on the other side that the costs at that grand final were substantially less than would be the case under a coalition government with a 15 per cent GST. That is the sort of point that has been made over and again today, and I want to make a few points about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who were at the game or who watched it on television will recall that the players ran on to the ground through the inevitable banners. It is worth our while reflecting on the fact that those banners were subject to a 20 per cent sales tax. The game began with the bouncing of the ball in the middle of the ground&mdash;and the ball was subject to 20 per cent sales tax. Those are taxes that will be abolished lock, stock and barrel by the coalition. The cars, and all their parts and accessories, which were crammed into the car parks around the MCG and into the streets around there were all subject to at least 20 per cent sales tax, with the exception of those that were bought in the last few months. The walkie-talkies that the dozens of parking attendants used, and the parking tickets themselves, were taxable at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the game was actually under way we had a little bit of a pause from taxation until the game was finally completed. The trophy was given to the West Coast Eagles team&mdash;and the trophy itself was subject to a 20 per cent sales tax. I said that we went through the game without tax, but it is worth reflecting that the umpire's whistle was taxed at 20 per cent, his watch was taxed at 30 per cent, the goal umpire's flags were taxed at 20 per cent, the siren, the scoreboard, the advertising hoardings around the ground, the speakers for the national anthem, the singing and so on were all taxable at a rate of 20 per cent by the present Government. The clock that was used to keep the time during the game was subject to 30 per cent tax and, of course, the clocks that told the time around the ground were also subject to 30 per cent tax. The banners waved by the cheer squads and the posters held up by the spectators were taxable at 20 per cent. The buttons, badges and programs purchased by spectators were also subject to 20 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to say that the abolition of that sales tax and the introduction of a 15 per cent GST would somehow make it more expensive to go to the football is, frankly, little short of risible. But it is also worth remembering that the AFL administration itself does not escape the Keating Government's sales tax rip-off. All of the AFL's office equipment&mdash;computers, paper, ink and so on&mdash;are taxable at a rate of 20 per cent. The toilets, the basins, the paper towels and dispensers that are used by the AFL are all taxable at 10 per cent or 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next time honourable members look at a football game, be it an AFL final or a rugby league game, it is very important that they take into consideration the enormous range of taxes imposed by the present Keating Government on those games and that they not be continually misled by the arguments from the other side of the chamber that somehow people going to these events will be taxed under the coalition in a way that they are not taxed under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 November, very soon, while we are sitting here in this Parliament, the Melbourne Cup will be under way and no doubt about 200,000 people&mdash;the honourable member for Kooyong would know a more accurate figure than that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About 100,000 people will attend the race. Again, this is going to be an absolute taxation bonanza for the present Government. Once more, it is important that people try to understand that and take it properly into account. For a start, by the time a typical racegoer gets to the race he or she will have paid one of the highest rates of income tax in the world. Although those on the other side of the chamber argue that we have a relatively low burden of tax as a proportion of GDP by OECD standards, the point of the argument is the tax mix. On the basis of the tax mix, we have around the fourth highest income tax burden of any country in the OECD. Under the coalition that income tax burden will be reduced by approximately one-third, by about 30 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those people going to the Melbourne Cup&mdash;or nearly all of them; those who are in employment and those who earn more than $5,400 a year&mdash;will get a very substantial income tax cut averaging around one-third. Of course, some people in that 100,000 or so crowd&mdash;about 8,000 of them&mdash;will not have a job; they will be unemployed, the victims of the present recession, who do not pay any income tax. Under the coalition, their Job Search allowance will be increased by 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if that were not enough, as if the fourth highest rates of personal income tax in the world are not enough to penalise those who go to the Melbourne Cup on 3 November, when the hopeful racegoers climb into their cars&mdash;on which of course they will have paid at least 20 per cent sales tax, unless they bought the car in the last few months&mdash;and head off to the races, 26c in taxation to the Keating Government will be paid on every litre of petrol that they consume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great moment comes and they finally arrive at the races. If they have some money left after having paid the fourth highest rates of income tax in the world and sales tax on their car and fuel tax on the way to the race, they may decide that they are exhausted from this steeplechase of taxation that they have already had to get across and that they need a drink. If they buy a beer, they pay on that beer not only excise but also 20 per cent sales tax. If they buy a Coke, a Fanta, a Solo or a Sprite&mdash;the sort of drink that they might buy&mdash;they will pay 20 per cent sales tax on that. If they buy wine or champagne, as some people do at the Melbourne Cup, there will be 20 per cent sales tax on that. Those are all taxes that will be abolished lock, stock and barrel by the coalition government, the Hewson government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they buy a pie or a hot dog or a packet of chips, the wrappers that those things come in will be subject to 20 per cent sales tax&mdash;a 20 per cent sales tax added by the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was the Treasurer of this country. The cups that the drinks come in will be subject to sales tax, and all the confectionery that is bought at the Melbourne Cup will be subject to 20 per cent sales tax. Any pennants or banners at the racecourse will be subject to 20 per cent tax, which is passed on in terms of the entrance fee. The entrance fee will also cover a 20 per cent tax on the race club's fittings, furnishings, carpets, lighting and general accoutrements. All of these taxes will be abolished under the coalition government. On top of that, anything that is bought on that race day, if it has been produced by somebody who employs more than around 15 people, will be subject to a 6 per cent payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the poor racegoers will stagger back into their cars. They may have had a good day at the races, but the statistics show that they will not have had a great day in terms of winnings. They will crawl back into their cars and pay 26c a litre on every litre of fuel they consume on the way home, and simply collapse, exhausted, after a day at the Melbourne Cup, which for them will have been a sales tax steeplechase&mdash;taxes that will be totally abolished by the Hewson government and replaced by a simple and equitable GST, which makes a lot more sense, particularly when coupled with a one-third reduction in personal income tax, an 8 per cent increase in pensions and a 6 per cent increase in other benefits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it has become very clear to any dispassionate observer that this Government will do anything and say anything to try to hang on to office. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs, an area in which I take a particular interest, for obvious reasons. The Government, in an attempt to discredit our Fightback approach to immigration, recently produced a further document in the series following <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS>. We are told that this document was prepared in the political arm of the Australian Labor Party rather than on the administrative side orchestrated through the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This document was designed to create in people's minds differences of view about the way in which the Government would handle immigration questions as against the way in which the Opposition would deal with these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the particular constituency of ethnic communities within Australia, the Government was desirous of creating a view that, if the Opposition approach was followed, ethnic communities in particular would suffer great difficulty and hardship as a result of the programs we intend to put in place. We are all familiar with this approach because the Government has always resorted to blatant fearmongering in an attempt to shore up its position and to differentiate its approach from ours, particularly in relation to immigration and ethnic affairs questions. When I am not around, I know that some of the apparatchiks of the Government have been known to go into particular refugee communities and say that if a coalition were elected we would be the first people to send the refugees back. I suppose that is a play on the issues we genuinely raise in relation to the way in which the Government dealt with the Chinese students in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Government is trying to create a picture of difference, it is important also to understand the schizoid approach it has taken to this issue. If one follows the comments of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), one would note that his concern is that the Government has been responding to an agenda set by the Opposition and that it is modelling its approach upon the arguments the Opposition has put before the Australian people over the last several years. I shall outline some of those matters where the Government has positively picked up suggestions that have been made by the Opposition. In some cases it could do well if it were to pick up others and take them even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Government has been reducing the immigration program. It was projected last year at 118,000 gross and this year it is programmed to come in at 80,000 gross. In the context of the debate about immigration, there has been a tailing off of the program under this Government. The Government introduced an English language test in the concessional family reunion category, with a requirement that English be spoken for particular occupations. This is designed to ensure that principal applicants in the points tested categories who are working in occupations where English is critical to their employment in Australia will be proficient in English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of concessional family reunion, when I first suggested that this sort of change was important and essential if we were to target our immigration program to those people who are able to settle successfully and reasonably quickly and to limit the cost to the adult migrant education program, which at the moment is unable to cope with the large numbers of non-English speakers who wish to obtain that skill, I was roundly criticised. The Government has also moved to restrict access to benefits to new arrivals in the first six months after entry, following on our suggestion that two years ought to be an appropriate period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this convergence of views, the Opposition and the Government are still clearly poles apart, but not in the sense that the Government has put it. Clearly, the extent of Australia's economic problems imposed by this Labor Government through its management and the Keating economic policies make it imperative that the immigration program is not only reduced but reduced further than we have seen to date. It needs to be clearly focused to produce a far better outcome that reflects our national interest goals. The coalition has argued that, in past recessions of much lesser magnitude than the present recession, the immigration program fell to between 50,000 and 70,000 net, a much lower figure than is likely to be achieved under the Government's present program. The program has been kept at a much higher than expected level because the Government was reducing over time&mdash;I suspect very much in accordance with the agenda set by the honourable member for Calwell&mdash;the criteria that people needed to meet in various categories. This is particularly so in the skills categories, where the Government removed the requirement for labour market testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government also removed the requirement in the concessional family category that there be sponsorship and that families be required to support their relatives when they came to Australia. The untargeted immigration program is well documented. The Government revealed that in 1991 some $400m in benefits was paid to those people who have been here for two years or less. We have suggested that an important restriction be imposed on access to benefits, particularly for those who are sponsored or who ought to have been sponsored, as well as those in the economic categories, although we did not want to impose it in the area of refugee entry. If those elements of our Fightback package were adopted there would be very substantial savings in the order of $250m. I do not believe it is unreasonable to adopt them. The Government's adoption in part of our proposal shows that it is not an unreasonable approach to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that in the immigration program there is the capacity to make considerable reductions in areas in which there have been rapid increases under this Labor Government. In the area of preferential family reunion we have argued that there needs to be enhanced bona fides testing to ensure that those people who are entering Australia, particularly on the basis of spouse and de facto relationships, are doing so only for immigration purposes. We have also suggested that in the area of employment nomination there is a need for enhanced bona fides testing to ensure that the people who are nominated by employers under that program will be supported by those employers, who obtain their entry to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of spouse entry we know that there are very simple suggestions that could achieve bona fides testing in a realistic and sensible way. For instance, in relation to spouses and de facto partners who obtain a grant of resident status in Australia, the Government adopted a requirement that they be in that relationship for a further two years after permission is granted for them to stay here. That is an important decision because it has had an effect upon reducing sham arrangements. There is no reasonable reason why those sorts of criteria should not be applied to those coming from offshore. The Government requires people to have been in a de facto relationship for a period of only six months in order for that relationship to be effective for migration purposes. We would lengthen that period to two years to demonstrate that a much more permanent and lasting relationship is intended before people are allowed to use it for migration purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of changes this Government could well adopt in a realistic and sensible way if it wanted to further constrain the immigration numbers. In the area of refugee entry, we have suggested changes that could equally be made to test people's bona fides. That is a matter that ought to be addressed on another occasion in a much more detailed way. The capacity is there for considerable reductions, which the Government does not challenge in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document but which could well be followed up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not join the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), in a debate about immigration. I wish to address my remarks to the local government allocation of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. There is no doubt that this Labor Government has a fine record in terms of its relationship with local government. It was, after all, the first government to create a separate ministry for local government. The Government sponsored the Self inquiry into the financial relationship between the Commonwealth and local government which resulted in the current system of financial assistance grants to local councils. In terms of the way in which local government deals with its funds, the Government has moved firmly down the path of allowing local councils throughout Australia to operate in a system of self-determination. There is a general move towards the untying of funds which means that local councils can make local decisions that recognise their particular circumstances. In my experience, they are best able to do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is involved in a range of partnership relationships with local government. For instance, under the home and community care programs services such as frail aged centres, respite centres and Meals on Wheels are often run cooperatively between local councils and community groups with funding from the Commonwealth Government. A similar program exists in relation to housing and child-care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of employment, the Government has a proud history of partnership with local government. During the early 1980s there was the community employment program, commonly known as the CEP, in which local government was the major participant, and most recently in this Budget the local capital works program, which sees some $350m being allocated to local government in order to create local employment and provide much needed local infrastructure programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government is also a major participant in a range of other labour market programs and schemes such as Jobskill. Indeed, councils in my own area participate in these labour market programs. I hope we will see increasing numbers involved in the new labour market programs, such as the local environment action program, which will be up and running very shortly. Of course, local government has a major interest in the area of road funding, and the Government is again providing a large amount of money in this Budget, including an expansion of the very successful black spots program which many local councils have put to good effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one area where I think the Government can improve its administration of local government. I am a little concerned at the way in which local government issues take very much a back seat in relation to their linkage with immigration and ethnic affairs. I believe that local government had a higher profile when the Ministry was linked with the Department of Administrative Services under former Minister, Mr Uren, when he was in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not being critical of local government Ministers since Mr Uren&mdash;I think they have done a fine job&mdash;but it is unfortunate that even in debates such as this the majority of speakers will canvass important immigration issues and often local government will be left on the back burner. Perhaps this does not apply to all speakers, but it is often the situation in relation to debates involving this portfolio that local government gets left out a bit. It may be worth looking at again combining local government with administrative services rather than with the immigration portfolio. I do not think there is any inherent link between local government and the administration of our immigration program that makes it essential that the two be grouped together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget for local government is now in the order of $1 billion in direct Commonwealth funding. I have already mentioned the capital works program. In my local area, something like $2.2m has been allocated to the Caboolture Shire Council. That money is already in the process of being spent. Projects have been approved, including the construction of a community hall at Morayfield and a Meals on Wheels kitchen at Burpengary. Some $430,000 has been allocated to the Esk Shire Council, and that money will go to a range of projects, including the building of a sports facility at Lowood and road works within the townships of Esk, Lowood and other parts of the shire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate invites us to contrast the Budget proposals of the Government with those of the Opposition as contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Fightback would hit local government particularly hard if it were ever implemented. Most directly, under the Opposition's plans local government will suffer a 5 per cent decrease in direct grants. Almost $37m will come off the top of funding to local councils in this country. In addition, another 5 per cent will be taken off State governments, and State governments are a major source of direct funding for local government. I think it is highly likely that State governments, in turn, will pass on their share of the 5 per cent cut to local councils, so there is a double whammy there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the Opposition will specifically abolish programs in which local government is currently participating, such as the capital works program and the sports facilities program. Over the years a large amount of money from the latter program has gone to helping local councils build local sports facilities. There will also be a general cut in labour market programs such as Jobskill. Trainees employed by local government will be a thing of the past if the Opposition ever gets its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the most insidious thing local councils would have to put up with if those opposite were in government would be the 15 per cent GST on local government services. Where exactly this would hit is uncertain because the Opposition has not been able to produce a list to say which local government services will be zero rated and which ones will be deemed to be commercial and, hence, will have the 15 per cent tax imposed upon them. But it is quite clear that the cost of services such as garbage collection will be increased by a 15 per cent tax. The supply of water would most likely be considered a commercial operation, and certainly various recreational facilities such as public swimming pools would have a GST imposed on their operation and entrance fees. Public halls, ovals and things of that nature which local governments run throughout Australia would also be subject to the tax. Since we are not sure what will be subject and what will not, maybe there will be an opportunity in this debate for the Opposition to spell that out a little more clearly; it has been extremely quiet about it in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this mean for the average ratepayer? The Brisbane City Council, which is the largest local authority in Australia, has conducted an exercise to try to calculate what the imposition of the Fightback policies will mean for its ratepayers. Its calculation is that every ratepayer in Brisbane city could expect a rate increase of some $211 annually because of the introduction of Fightback. That is an extra $200 slug which I do not think the Opposition has calculated in terms of its other proud boasts about reducing personal income taxes and other taxes. It will definitely be increasing local government taxes, rates and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not even the end of it. How will local councils comply with the administrative burdens that will be imposed upon them? At the moment, councils are exempt from the wholesale sales tax system. If councils go out and buy fleets of motor vehicles, which most councils do, no sales tax attaches to that. Under the Opposition's proposals, councils will pay GST on the purchase of motor vehicles. They will then have to submit a form in order to try to get a rebate on the payment of that tax, provided the motor vehicle is being used for business purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a whole administrative structure will have to be set up within each of the 900-odd local authorities in Australia  to claim back tax which at the moment they are not having to pay at all. It has been estimated that the initial start-up cost of putting that administrative system in place will be $10,000 or $15,000, with that sort of annual fee also being added to administration. Obviously, the larger the council and the more complicated its transactions the larger the administrative burden will be. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to join in this debate. I must say that I listened with some amazement to the utter nonsense that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) was peddling. It reinforces what my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) said a few minutes ago when he described the present Government as it goes through its last stages of the death throes and drew attention to the fact that it will do anything or say anything to try to stay in office. That view was reinforced in the speech of the honourable member for Fisher. I would have thought that someone who came into this chamber would have taken the time and trouble to do a bit of homework before he mouthed the sort of nonsense that has been mouthed in some of the statements from the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak firstly about the local government capital works program. I will refer to the extraordinary behaviour displayed by the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) when he clearly and deliberately misled the House. This was pointed out in a motion that was put before this chamber. I will go on to point out how the Government has failed dismally to adequately respond to the challenge that the Fightback package has put to it, particularly as it affects local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the local government capital works program, there is no doubt that local government has gratefully received the funding and there is no doubt that the majority of councils will use the money very effectively for what it has been designed. But the key point is: why was it necessary? If the Government had not driven us into recession&mdash;the recession that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us we had to have&mdash;if the Government had not driven nearly one million people into unemployment, had not driven so many people into part time work when they were looking for more than that and had not driven a record number of people into bankruptcies then the question would then arise: was it necessary to bring this program in at all? While I believe that the majority of councils will use that money very effectively, the tragedy is that it was needed in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I wish to raise is the extraordinary behaviour of the Minister himself when on 19 August he tabled this marvellous document which has headed `Local Capital Works Program&mdash;Notional Allocation by Federal Electorate'. The Minister put his name to it, tabled it and was forced eventually to withdraw it when he realised that if we did a bit of simple arithmetic and added up what was there we would find that, instead of some $345m, which was the Budget allocation, it came to well over $600m. He was prepared to bring this into this Parliament, table it and say, `This is the sort of thing that we ought to be proud of'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was prepared to use the figures in Question Time. When we started to look at this table we found some very interesting things. The most amazing was: guess who topped the list? It was the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), with over $20m notionally being allocated to his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we looked into this list further we found that there were 10 electorates in New South Wales which were notionally allocated $10m or more, and all of those just happened to be electorates of sitting Labor members. It may be a coincidence, but it was an observation that I made. When we looked at Victoria we found that there were only five who received that sort of allocation, and all bar one was a Labor electorate. When we looked at Queensland there were only two. Both of them apparently received an identical allocation&mdash;McPherson and Moncrieff&mdash;but when we looked into it we found that it was something like half that. The Minister was prepared to bring it in here and say, `Aren't I generous?'. If we look at South Australia we see that there was another seat allocated over $10m, a Labor seat. In Western Australia there were two&mdash;one Labor and one coalition. In poor old Tasmania the allocations were much less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Minister came in here, tried to make political capital and made a complete fool of himself. When he was asked to explain why he had misled the House he continued to claim that he had not misled the House. That was quite extraordinary. I think his exact words were, `I have not misled the House at all'. What an extraordinary thing to have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Fightback package, I think the honourable member for Fisher seems to have some difficulty in reading it, when he made statements like, `Under local government, garbage and water would have an increase of 15 per cent'. He knows, as I am sure everyone in this chamber knows, that the GST will not be put on until a number of other taxes have been removed&mdash;taxes such as sales tax, fuel tax, payroll tax and so on. He goes on to talk about what the additional costs may or may not be for people using those services and again he conveniently overlooks, as has been made very clear on many occasions, that under the Fightback package there will be significant tax cuts&mdash;major tax cuts of around 30 per cent. For pensioners and those on benefits there will be other compensation. He knows that too. I think he ought to be balanced in his assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also goes on to talk about the administrative costs that may come for local government. But local government has to claim back its sales tax. It is not as though councils are starting from scratch. If honourable members look, councils still have to claim the tax. If one looks at some of the assessments that have been made by organisations such as the Municipal Association of Victoria one will see very clearly that in its detailed assessment it does not anticipate that there will be much of an increase in the administrative burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Municipal Association of Victoria has gone a lot further than that and said that it believes that on balance most councils will probably find themselves hardly affected at all. When the honourable member for Fisher talks about the 5 per cent cut he again ignores the benefits that councils will get directly&mdash;for example, the removal of fuel tax, payroll tax, training levies and so on. In other areas we will have cheaper tenders because people who tender for work now will also be getting those benefits from taking business taxes off. All of those things mean that there will be considerable benefits for local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, when we talk about the benefits for local government, that my colleague Senator Macdonald has on a number of occasions challenged the Minister to demonstrate one council that will not be cheaper to run under a coalition government. He has put that challenge and it seems that the Minister is still unable to respond. The Government really ought to put up or shut up on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put things in perspective, between 1983 and 1992, if we look at the financial assistance grants that have been given to local government, we see that in real terms there has been a cut of 6.1 per cent under Labor. Here it is trying to criticise others. I think it ought to have a good look at its own record before it goes on. We are seeing the new fringe benefits tax arrangements which again are going to disadvantage local government. So I suggest that the Government certainly does not come to this debate with a clean pair of hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confidence of local government must be sorely dented when it sees a document like this being presented by a Minister of the Federal Parliament. Simple arithmetic will show that the figures in the document do not add up. It is a document that was designed to promote the Government in the most generous way as being very helpful for local government and certainly overstating the assistance, by nearly double, that was being given to each Federal electorate. There is no doubt that local government must be sorely tempted to ask how much longer it deserves to have such a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many benefits that are going to come from Fightback. It is clear that local government, through organisations such as the Municipal Association of Victoria, has assessed and recognised that not only are there direct benefits but also indirect benefits for people who pay their rates and charges. They are going to be very significant and very much to their advantage. I believe that overall local government has much to look forward to under the Fightback package. </PARA>

I was going to agree with a previous speaker in this debate from this side of the Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), that more should be said about local government, particularly when it is associated with the division of appropriations, as it is in this debate, but I now have to put to right a number of misleading statements that have just come before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notional allocation by Federal electorate was clearly explained. If the honourable member for Wannon and the coalition had not been blind and had not tried to score cheap political points, they would have seen that clearly laid out in the documentation associated with the Budget Papers, and in what was circulated to those local government areas, were the reasons as to why the allocations were made in the first place, how they came about and how all of us were informed that, as the Federal electorates comprised more than one local government area, they were the total allocations of those specific electorates, not local government areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two cities in my electorate of Prospect&mdash;Fairfield city and Holroyd city. The Fairfield city area, because of its composition, its high ethnic vote, its high unemployment and its high population, received the largest allocation in Australia&mdash;over $9m, which has already been put to use. The total in those two areas came to $12m. I did not, through all of the documentation I read, come to the conclusion that one was going to get $12m and the other was going to get $12m. It was very clearly laid out. As I have said before in debate before this chamber, the Minister and his Department should be congratulated for the fairness with which the distribution of funding was made to the 400-odd councils around Australia out of 915 local government areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ludicrous to say that local government will not suffer under a GST. The coalition does not know what it is talking about if it does not believe that local government has worked out where it will be affected&mdash;only on the limited information that has been supplied to it to date, because the Opposition has not come clean about what the GST will really mean to local government in Australia and how local government will be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know, for example, that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has stated that direct funding would be cut to local government and local government funding from the States would be cut. When we read further into the Opposition's documents, we find that funding for programs administered by local government would be cut and a number of local government activities would also be taxed. Out of this, the only conclusion we can come to is that the coalition's policies for local government are vague and its attitude towards the effect on local government of the GST is dismissive. It is describing it as merely administrative detail. I put down the challenge to Opposition members. When will their administrative detail become public knowledge? That is the question being asked by local government throughout Australia. That is what it wants to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major problem for local government around Australia is the coalition's 5 per cent cut in financial assistance grants. In 1992-93 terms, that would mean a cut of $36.75m to Australia's 915 local government authorities. The smallest councils, already highly dependent on those grants from the State governments, could not absorb this type of cut. They certainly could not look to the States for help because the States, we have also been informed, would lose 5 per cent in general purpose grants under a coalition government if ever it were to get into power. In other words, over $750m in today's dollars would be cut from the States. If services do not have to be cut, where will the money come from to assist local government? The Opposition would say that many out of the diverse range of Commonwealth programs that are now feeding into local government should be cut, including the Australia Council, the better cities program and, as has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Fisher, the sports assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also informed us that it would axe the local government capital works program announced in the 1992 Budget which, as I have just reiterated, helped so many of those councils which are suffering at the moment from very high unemployment. It is not, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, giving people shovels and lining them up in local councils just to do mickey mouse jobs. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, in his comment on that type of program, and the Opposition are insulting local government and the many Australians who certainly will benefit from that program which is now in place. As I mentioned, the two councils in my electorate have received something like $12m under that local capital works program, which is helping them to pay for capital works that their communities have needed but which they have not had the financial capacity to see implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this Budget funding, local authorities in my electorate have the benefit of a new and expanded program to help them get their communities working. The local capital works program is providing an immediate, one-off boost to the Prospect electorate, and particularly to the Fairfield region, which, I admit, unfortunately has experienced above average unemployment. The grants which are funding capital works are putting cash into our local economies, creating jobs and, most importantly, building confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fairfield city has something like 20 projects approved for funding. These projects, which include the construction of an aquatic centre in Prairiewood, the extension of the Whitlam Library and the upgrading of various sporting and recreation facilities, costing $12.5m, received $9.2m in Federal funding and the rest was supplied by the council through its own revenues. The approved list of projects is very well balanced. It covers a range of different functions, including public works, parks and gardens, and recreational and community services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Fairfield City Council and its staff should be congratulated on their efforts in organising and compiling the submission for funding. They did it swiftly and with a great deal of commonsense. The cooperation and enthusiasm that this Federal Government program has been met with is extremely encouraging, and I appreciate the opportunities given to me by the Council for consultation on the submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the GST, the Leader of the Opposition, as we have just been informed, would eliminate the wholesale sales tax. The abolition of the wholesale sales tax would not help local government because it is already wholesale sales tax exempt. This means that the effect of the GST would be particularly harsh on councils. For example, at present local councils buy motor vehicles without sales tax and they usually have a fleet owner discount. Councillors are aware that the motor vehicles are quite cheap and the trade-in is then taken into account. This would change with the introduction of the GST. While the regulatory and non-commercial activities of local authorities would be zero rated, all activities that qualify as commercial under the Opposition's very liberal definition would be subject to the 15 per cent GST&mdash;another 15 per cent slug to the ratepayers. Again, the Opposition will not come clean on this subject. How can we be fully informed and have a fully informed debate on the matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been suggestions from the Opposition's own committee on GST implementation issues that, like New Zealand, it would end up as a 15 per cent Federal double tax on rates. I suggest that honourable members read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 1 September 1992. The commercial activities of councils certainly would be taxed. This Opposition members admit. I would like them to define `commercial activities' as to whether they include garbage collection and disposal; the supply of water, gas and electricity; swimming pools and the price of going into them; recreational activities; public transport; transport of goods; provision and control of caravan parks, aerodromes, child-care; parking; and agricultural and forestry undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some organisations have made calculations which should sound warning bells for all of us. The Commonwealth Office of Local Government found that the greatest impact would be in country areas where councils have a very limited income base. The Office estimates that increases in average rates in New South Wales could be as high as $134 in Armidale, on top of what people already pay now, and $106 in Albury. The honourable member for Fisher has already stated what the Brisbane City Council had calculated would happen if it had a consumption tax. It would add something like $211 to a Brisbane ratepayer's total bill at the moment. This did not even take into account the Opposition's proposed cut to financial assistance grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In States where rate pegging applies, such as New South Wales, councils are not likely to be able to fund the GST-related cost increases through their rate collections. They would have to cut, or charge more for, the services they now provide. Many Sydney councils, for example, have already increased charges for facilities that should be available at an affordable cost to the community. For example, hall rentals would increase under the coalition's GST. Local communities running a hall for the councils would need to levy a GST and organise all the paperwork required. The GST would also treat the majority of non-profit bodies, such as elderly citizens clubs, sporting clubs and community hall committees, as commercial activities. The impact of treating non-profit community activities as commercial activities is not explained in Fightback and obviously requires further study. Again, we wait for the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government coordinates and funds many community activities. Every community group would need to keep detailed records of all GST paid on inputs&mdash;in other words, supplies. Forms would have to be completed to pay GST or to gain a credit and subsequent refund. The treasurer would need to become an accountant. Either members of the elderly citizens clubs would pay a membership fee increase of 15 per cent plus compliance costs or local government would be asked for increased grants. Ultimately, the whole community would pay and continue to pay. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address today a number of matters in relation to this allocation for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I would first of all like to thank a few members of the Whichway Ballarat Committee. You probably know some of these people, Mr Scholes. They were in Canberra on 9 September and met with a large number of Ministers and shadow Ministers. That group was made up of the present Mayor, Councillor James Coghlan; Mr Brian Nunn, who is the Chairman of the Ballarat Regional Board; Mr David Peile, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the city of Ballarat; Mr David Miller, who is on the Ballarat Regional Board; Graeme Shearer, who would be known to you, Mr Scholes, from the trades hall in Ballarat; Mr Frank Sheehan, the former member for Ballarat East; and Mr Ian Brain from the Brotherhood of St Laurence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a group of local government representatives, under the auspices of the Ballarat Regional Board, who are not about handouts but are about doing something themselves. They came to Canberra and put it to the Ministers and the shadow Ministers that Ballarat needed some assistance. They were not looking for handouts; they wanted to work with government to ensure that the diabolical situation that is presently facing Ballarat is addressed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the September unemployment figures, there are 7,290 people in Ballarat who are in receipt of unemployment benefits&mdash;that is, 7,290 people who are former breadwinners; 7,290 people who are family men and women; 7,290 people who are not being given a fair go by this Government. The Whichway Ballarat Committee is seeking to address those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some mention after the Budget about the impact of the local capital works program. Indeed, I put out a press release welcoming the fact that money had been put into the Ballarat region. But I also said that there are other regions, including Geelong, which have seemed to receive extraordinary sums of money compared with the amount received by the Ballarat region. I am sure that even you, Mr Scholes, as a defender of Geelong&mdash;and also the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur)&mdash;would have to admit that the problems being faced in your region are diabolical but that they are no greater or lesser than those in the Federal seat of Ballarat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding amounts are quite extraordinary. Funding for the Ballarat region was some $3 1/2m, but funding for the Geelong region was over $7m. The Ballarat Regional Board has looked into this matter and it has a large number of concerns. I am not saying that we in the Ballarat region are not happy with the money we got&mdash;because we are; we are very happy for any assistance&mdash;but we do not believe we are being properly treated in relation to this program. I can see no good reason why Geelong and Bendigo should have received the sums of money they did when the region of Ballarat, which is probably suffering more than those two regions, received half the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues that have been raised by the Regional Board are as follows. First, the DEET estimate of the labour force for the Ballarat region shows a sharp decline over the four quarters from the September quarter 1991. Was this to correct an earlier statistical error? Second, the estimated levels of unemployment for Ballarat municipalities are much lower than local evidence, such as CES registrations or Ballarat University College survey results, would suggest. Is the DEET methodology at fault? Third, the somewhat arbitrary way that municipalities have been grouped to form OLG regions may have caused Ballarat to miss out on category 1 funding even though the local unemployment rate is consistently above the national rate. If, for example, Ararat City and Ararat Shire were included in the Ballarat region, the average labour force would have exceeded 60,000 and Ballarat would have qualified for category 1 funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, the larger size&mdash;that is, in terms of the number of municipalities&mdash;of the Bendigo and Shepparton regions made them more likely to become category 1 regions and receive higher levels of funding. Fifth, individual municipalities within category 1 regions received capital works funding, even when the unemployment rate within those municipalities was below the national rate. Yet municipalities such as Ararat missed out on receiving any funds. Sixth, despite having an unemployment rate at the June 1992 quarter of 24 per cent, Maryborough received only category 2 funding because it was part of the Ballarat region. Had Maryborough been grouped with the Bendigo region, the city would have attracted category 1 funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventh, funding allocations should have been made to individual municipalities on the basis of the numbers of unemployed within each municipality. By allocating the largest proportion of funding in the first instance to regions, the Government has not ensured the funds are being equitably directed to where they are most needed. Eighth, has the Ballarat region therefore missed out on more than $1m worth of additional capital works funding as a result of the arbitrariness of the allocation process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are matters raised by the Ballarat Regional Board, but there are also serious matters raised by the Shire of Stawell and the City of Stawell. That area received no funding at all. A meeting of a large number of municipalities was held in the city of Horsham on 8 September, and they were extremely aggrieved that there was no funding given to them at all. On behalf of those municipalities, I urge the Government to look at other areas to address the very real concerns they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the chamber to look at the effect of a different tax on local government&mdash;the fringe benefits tax&mdash;in the recently announced Budget. Let us not hear all this waffle from people such as the honourable member for Prospect about the effect of a GST on local government when we see what this Budget has done, in terms of financial penalties, to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to immigration, I got the Parliamentary Library to look at the figures for New Zealand born settlers arriving in Australia. It is pretty interesting to see how the Kiwis are voting with their feet. In 1987, 15,360 New Zealand born settlers arrived in Australia; in 1988, 24,870; in 1989, 17,340; in 1990, 8,970; and in 1991, 6,730. I can see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), is looking incredulous. He may well do, because the Kiwis are now seeing the results of the intestinal fortitude that the Labour Party and then the National Party had in relation to the New Zealand economy. Do not ever forget that it was a Labour Party, a Labour Government, that introduced what we are going to introduce into this country. It gets worse. I will quote from an article about what Heinz has announced in relation to Wattie's. The article states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking this evening on the portfolio of immigration, local government and ethnic affairs, I would like to expand on some comments I made the other day in relation to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's refugee and humanitarian system: Achieving a balance between refugee and control</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled earlier this year. A refugee crisis of proportions not seen since World War II has been developing on a global scale. Today there are 17 1/2 million refugees and asylum seekers in different parts of the world. One of the most devastating crises the world has seen in recent times is the crisis in the former Federation of Yugoslavia, which has produced 1.3 million refugees and displaced persons. I have recently experienced this traumatic event at first hand, and I will comment on that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia first took part in refugee resettlement in the 1920s. Before the Second World War Australia admitted approximately 7,000 persons displaced as a result of developments in Germany and German-occupied territories. However, it was not until the post-war period that Australia began to play a significant role in refugee settlement programs. Australia joined the International Refugee Organisation in 1947 and has since accepted around 350,000 refugees from other parts of the world, including South East Asia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lebanon and Sri Lanka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia, like many other receiving nations, is today confronted with complex issues arising from the refugee crisis. One of the key issues is how best to respond to the worldwide refugee crisis while at the same time maintaining a tight and non-discriminatory immigration policy. Today I will mention some of the recommendations made in the report produced in August by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. I believe that these recommendations would facilitate a better approach to Australia's refugee and immigration policy and should be given urgent consideration for adoption by the Government. The report, which took two years to complete, has generated much interest and has been generally received as a well-balanced and constructive document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recognises that a balance needs to be struck between the best humanitarian outcome for asylum seekers and the need to ensure that Australia maintains control over its procedures and systems for admission of refugees. The report is the most comprehensive assessment ever undertaken of the refugee situation in Australia, focussing on all issues concerning asylum seekers. Asylum seekers are persons who seek refuge at Australia's borders and persons who are temporary residents or illegal entrants seeking asylum in Australia. One of the most contentious issues arising from the report is the outstanding question of People's Republic of China nationals arriving in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In my speech to this chamber on immigration on 5 May this year I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in June 1989, 20,000 Chinese students in Australia were given four-year temporary visas to remain. This decision to grant those visas was virtually a unilateral decision of an emotionally influenced Prime Minister who, in one fell swoop, corrupted the immigration program of this country . . . this year about 14,000 dependants are expected to join the students in Australia . . . Of course, social security and other benefits were extended as a consequence . . . Prime Minister Keating has compounded the original emotion-ridden decision of Prime Minister Hawke to destroy the equity, credibility and morality of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The majority of the Committee members supported the view of the coalition on this matter and urged reconsideration of the Federal Government's undertaking given by former Prime Minister Hawke in 1990 and restated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this year. The coalition supports the move for Chinese nationals to test their claims for residency against normal selection criteria when their special visas expire in June 1994. This view is given support in the following extract from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy . . . has contributed significantly to the immense burden which has been placed on Australia's refugee determination system over the past three years . . . It has resulted in many thousands more Chinese arriving in Australia after the Tiananmen Square incident without appropriate bona fide checks. The decision to grant a four year permit to Chinese students has produced community resentment, particularly among groups like the Sri Lankans, Lebanese and Cambodians, who have at least as good if not better claims to protection . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition position supports consistent and principled decision making. The same criteria should apply to all refugees from all parts of the world. It was also decided that a situation where some refugees had attained a quasi-guest worker status had to be avoided. A quasi-permanent class would not give right to all entitlements to benefits accessible to Australian citizens, no matter how long they lived here. It would create problems already evident in other countries where these arrangements are presently undertaken, such as Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Germany has been quick to respond positively and in a humane way to the refugee crisis in the former Yugoslav Federation and eastern Europe. However, along with enormous economic problems, Germany is facing a massive crisis, with around 800,000 refugee claimants from 1990 to 1992 arriving in an almost uncontrolled fashion. Many of these refugees are fleeing from the war in the former Federation of Yugoslavia&mdash;from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and elsewhere where there is conflict. Having just arrived back from a very brief visit to the war-torn capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sarajevo, and having seen the dreadful conditions experienced by people in that city and understanding some of the conditions being faced by those affected by fighting in other parts of the country, I can well understand the immense pain and suffering and fear that is being endured by the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee in its report has recognised that priority should be given to those in greatest humanitarian need. Australia's offshore humanitarian program is evidence of this commitment. One of the most important concessions offered by Australia as part of this program is the so-called Yugoslav concession, which has been of considerable benefit and support to people who have been seriously and directly affected by the conflict in the former Federation of Yugoslavia. The spirit of this commitment is reflected in the Committee's recommendation that the policy of giving short term extensions of temporary stay to particular groups in humanitarian need be continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended that short term extensions of stay not only should be given to individuals in a class or group affected by civil disorder, but also should be considered for individuals in groups whose homes or livelihoods have been affected adversely by a major natural disaster. It is also recommended that in cases where an extension or repeated extensions of stay in excess of one year have been given, before any further permit extension is granted the applicants ought to be expected to show not only that they are citizens of the country affected by the civil strife or natural disaster but additionally that their homes, livelihood or families are in areas affected by the conflict or disaster, or that they would be required to return to the area affected by the disorder or disaster if returned home. This is very important. While offering support to refugees, this recommendation is consistent with ensuring that asylum is provided for those deemed in need of assistance. Once conditions improve for the refugees, appropriate measures would be taken to return them to a hopefully safer environment in their home country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant aspects of refugee claimants in Western countries such as Australia is that these countries are both the first and last asylum. Australia as a developed nation cannot look to other nations for assistance in meeting refugee demands. It is therefore vitally important that all immigration processes are sharpened to ensure that swifter and more efficient procedures are established. As immigration law expert David Martin stated in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If (government officials) are blocked from developing swifter and more efficient procedures, or from systematic implementation of negative decisions (for example, because of effective, if short-sighted, refugee advocacy or judicial intervention), all signs point toward a proliferation of barriers and obstacles,&mdash;which are much harder for activists and judges to affect. This is not in the best interests of refugee and asylum seekers. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recognises in the report that relevant Commonwealth departments, such as the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department, should monitor overseas experiences in dealing with large scale movements by refugee claimants. The message that is coming through is that monitoring of refugee movements worldwide is essential. Australia is participating in a cooperative global initiative and therefore has to be informed and aware of the collective international implications of these refugee crises. To sum up, I believe that the Committee has made some very sound recommendations that should be taken on board immediately. What is certain is that the refugee crisis is an international problem that will continue up to the turn of the century and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few moments of my address this evening, I turn again to a matter that is yet to be resolved; that is, the difference of opinion between the two leading spokesmen on immigration matters for the Government. They are the two most senior in this area&mdash;the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations and the chairman of the Caucus committee on immigration. This difference of opinion, which revolves around the question of the PRC students, is irreconcilable as far as can be seen from the reports we are aware of and from the heated debates and clashes that have occurred even within this building between the two individuals. As I mentioned last week, it is now clearly up to the Minister to make a determination about how the Government's policy will continue under these circumstances.

I checked the figures and found that $5m was going to be spent in the electorate of Parramatta and that only four or five streets of the city of Parramatta are within the electorate of Mitchell. Yet it was claimed by the Government that I would have the advantage of programs of $5m worth to assist local governments in the electorate of Mitchell. This is the height of sophistry.

It has three or four really worthy projects ready to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate that I represent is a tourist destination for overseas and interstate tourists. It borders on the Hawkesbury River and there are some delightful tourist spots. On further investigation the claims by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and the Minister for Tourism were found to be overstated and false. There is no advantage for unemployed people in the electorate of Mitchell from this program, but Government statements indicate the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Mitchell has a rapidly increasing level of unemployment which is increasing faster than any other electorate in Australia. The group affected is aged between 30 and 55. They are middle management people, mainly males, with mortgages and with teenage kids. Many of them are losing their homes as well as their jobs. Their wives are out doing part time work. The trauma that has been created by this Government's policies is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot overstate the problems of all sorts that have been created in our community by the attitudes and the policies of this Government. Then we see a glimmer of hope: the prospect of some unemployment program, albeit a superficial program. It is not getting to the basis of the problem of unemployment at all; it is throwing money at the problem and hoping that it will be fixed up, hoping that the figures will improve before the next election. The Government has no heart at all. It is not concerned about people; it is just concerned about electorates and whether it will win them. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the funds that have apparently been allocated to Mitchell are not allocated to the electorate of Mitchell or those local government bodies within Mitchell; they are allocated to neighbouring electorates which are marginal electorates held by Australian Labor Party members. It is an absolute misuse of power and the power of the purse to try to encourage people to think that the Government is doing things when it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good projects for the development of the tourist industry.

This will not go ahead with Commonwealth funds despite the statements of the Minister for Tourism. They are absolutely misleading. I could not believe it when I analysed what he had said and what the results on the ground were to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few other comments about Australia's immigration program, which is a disaster. For three years the Labor Government has fooled around. It has basically extended our welfare policies to encompass the rest of the world. By not adopting a program seeking to encourage people with skills, knowledge and the ability to settle in Australia&mdash;people who would make a contribution to our economic growth and prospects&mdash;by not extending the programs and favouring those people, it has extended the welfare system to anybody who wants to come here. Over the last few months the Government has tried to limit the availability of welfare taxpayer assistance to migrants coming to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have come here over the last three years will make good Australians. But in harsh economic times it is extremely difficult to explain to the Australian community that we should maintain a program which is basically founded on semi and unskilled migrants when the children of Australians living in this country find it so difficult to find work. We have built a pool of unemployment of the short term unemployable by our immigration policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad thing that the Government has not sought to limit its programs to those with the abilities and skills to make a contribution. Rather than seeking to focus on those people, no matter where they come from, to limit those programs to people who will make a positive contribution, the Government has made it more difficult for the independent migrant to reach this country. Its adjustments to the program have sought to make it more difficult for those with a degree, or those with skills that are recognised in Australia, to get here. The Government has increased the points score and the hurdles that these people must jump over, but it has retained family reunion programs without much change. It has exacerbated the situation by its head in the sand attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Opposition has adopted sound policies, but we are criticised for it. I think it is time the Government woke up and the Minister realised that immigration in harsh times can create problems. A massive reduction in the program is warranted in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time the Government changed its policies, its directions. It is high time the Government recognised the fact that most of the Chinese students that the former Prime Minister so lavishly granted quasi residence to were not under threat when they left the People's Republic of China. Those who came after Tiananmen Square were not under threat either. To grant such carte blanche entry, as the previous Prime Minister did, to such a large number of people adds to the pool of people who lack skills and who will gain benefits from our welfare system. </PARA>

Senator Walsh was right, the programs of this Government on immigration are not well founded, not well thought through, not based on benefit to the national interest, and they should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just concluded an extensive debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1). We have had an opportunity on both sides to express our views in the second reading debate and in the committee stage. Many of the subjects covered in those debates also have application to the subject matter of Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which involves the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites, the purchase of items of plant and equipment and the like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to keep the House long in this second reading debate except to note that during those earlier debates, to the extent that they referred to the subject matter of Appropriation Bill (No. 2), it was both sad and flattering to see Government members concentrating so much of their contributions to attacks on coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it is sad because it is indicative of no policies and no answers in the Government ranks. That is apparent because the `One Job, One Nation' statement brought down earlier this year and the Budget itself sank within a matter of days of each being brought down. Neither has become a matter for serious debate, the statement and the Budget having been dismissed as irrelevant for a number of reasons. It is flattering because it confirms what most of the nation already knows&mdash;that, led by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the coalition has set the political agenda in this country from day one; that is, from the commencement of his leadership back in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has shown in this debate, at Question Time and in public forums that it is unable to hack the pace in the sense that it cannot come up with policies which match or in any way can be considered comparable to those presented by the coalition parties. As a result of that we saw ALP members in this place parroting lines, mouthing slogans and doing virtually all those things which they were asked to do rather than to make positive contributions to the debate on the Appropriation Bills. They, along with the Ministry, the Government itself, have been prepared to say anything and do anything to ensure their re-election. They have been led, I am sad to say, by a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is obviously out of control and ominously out of touch with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to digress for a moment to point out, particularly in the context of this Bill, why this Government will not engender the confidence that we so desperately need in this country today.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While business reacts as it does, we can understand the pessimism that reigns outside and amongst those of us inside this Parliament who simply see the Government and the Prime Minister as being out of control and out of touch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this country is to begin its slow climb upwards to provide the employment necessary, to provide the economic growth and, in the process, to be able, as a result of the generation of growth by business, to look after those people in need, we require a viable, confident business based on the certainty that only government can give it through sound economic management. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry probably summarised it as well as anyone. It began in this passage by asking the rhetorical question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can anyone really blame business for being seriously concerned about a Budget which has all of the following consequences:</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to enumerate the consequences. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.it increases taxes on business through increases in the FBT,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.it threatens further large tax increases to fund the promised personal tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose again that they are somewhere down the track. If the Prime Minister were given to kindness, if he were given to decency, he would call an election and put this country out of its misery. Unfortunately, he is not that sort and this country, regrettably, will have to labour under Labor, pardon the pun, until the last gasp.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on the appropriations for the Parliament. I think it is fair to say that the amount of funds appropriated to the Parliament over the period I have been here has probably quadrupled in real terms; it might even have increased by a greater amount than that. That is largely because the Parliament has changed and it undertakes a far broader range of functions. But what I want to deal with more is whether or not the Parliament has itself been prepared to make the necessary adjustments to carry out the business which it now is required to carry out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my estimation, the Bills that go through this Parliament now&mdash;the amount of legislation&mdash;are far more numerous and far more complex than in 1967. It affects and touches almost the total range of aspects of our community. Many aspects were not legislated for anywhere in 1967; others were largely the province of the States or were substantially looked after by the community as a whole. The Parliament has not given itself the necessary procedures and processes which would enable it to carry out that amount of business. On an estimate that I made recently for another purpose, it would seem that in the first 70 years of this Parliament the House met on more days of the year than it passed major pieces of legislation; and I count group legislation in that. It now passes about one Bill for every hour of sitting time which is devoted to government business. That is not sufficient time to provide scrutiny; it is not sufficient time to actively involve the House of Representatives in the procedures of governing this country and the decision making processes which it is responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience, the Cabinet, the Executive&mdash;which is a function of the Crown, not the Parliament&mdash;has also streamlined, if that is the word, its procedures, so that the ERC probably has had more say in the final shape of this Budget which we are passing tonight than has the Cabinet itself. The House of Representatives rubber stamps the Cabinet decision and the Cabinet rubber stamps the ERC decision. That may well be good for government. It may well be the way in which Executives have to operate. The Parliament has certain specific responsibilities. I want to make a plea for something I have been trying to get people to take up for the last 15 years, that is, enabling the Parliament to carry out its duties. If more legislation is brought into the Parliament than the Parliament can deal with, and that has been true at least since 1972, then the Parliament will truncate its proceedings because the Government program will be met&mdash;it does not matter who is in government&mdash;and therefore the House will abdicate its responsibilities or concede its responsibilities to the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are means by which, without sitting for hundreds of days&mdash;which is one of the alternatives&mdash;and continuing to use the 1900 practices, which we are still using in this chamber, that we could give a lot more time to the legislative process and the examination of Budgets. A government has a majority in this House; otherwise it is not a government. So the House is not going to go through a process of some sort of independent assessment, no matter who is in government; but it does have a responsibility to look at and to examine Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have proposed on a number of occasions, and I think we have reached the stage where we either do it or we stop going through the pretence of dealing with legislation&mdash;which is what we do on many occasions&mdash;is to use what many other organisations, including parliaments elsewhere in the world, have been forced to use, which is to allow the Parliament to function as a plenary and a committee body whereby a committee of the House, consisting of less than the total number of members and able to meet concurrently with other committees, can deal with legislation, statements and other matters that it is felt should be examined and in which members have an interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee sitting in this chamber on Wednesday afternoon&mdash;I use that only as an example&mdash;after Question Time, the House having dissolved into committee, could do exactly the same business, with properly framed Standing Orders, as the House itself does. At the same time, at least two other similar committees could meet in committee rooms of this House, which we now have, and treble the time available for debate on that one day. Using only one day we could double the sitting times available to this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that we have is that it is convenient to keep going the way we are, and we will do so until we reach the stage where we will be merely standing up and moving that Bills be passed, and members will be coming to Canberra for the sole purpose of being here, but taking little or no part in the procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pass a lot of legislation and spend a lot of money on the Parliament. It is not too difficult a task&mdash;indeed it would relieve a lot of responsibility from the front bench on both sides&mdash;to adopt that sort of procedure. That would also make room, because the time would then become available, for the House to have genuine debates. There have been about half a dozen good debates that honourable members can remember in the last four or five years. A censure motion now goes usually for two or three speakers. Without having a shot at anyone, because we behaved the same when we were on the other side of the House, I have to say that censure motions tend to become less and less important in the procedures and more and more a vehicle to initiate debate. But there was a time when they were debated all day. There was a time when, when such a motion was moved, the Prime Minister used to adjourn the House until the next day of sitting. That certainly made them important. But the House no longer has that luxury. Debates on the economy should take place in this House, and they should take place regularly. The last time that we had a genuine debate on defence or foreign affairs is almost beyond living memory, with the exception of the Gulf war debate, which was a good debate. Honourable members contributed to that debate and showed that they can contribute when the opportunity is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now some five years since the Procedure Committee of this House was set up to examine the Standing Orders of the House. None of the significant reports of that Committee are embodied completely in the Standing Orders. In fact, the committee system under which we are now completing our second parliament still operates under a sessional order. I have to say that the members and the Chairman of that Committee over a period of time have faced great frustration. We can spend hours going through Standing Orders, which is not the most exuberant occupation, then make a report to the Parliament, only to find that the parliament expires, the next parliament expires, and the next parliament expires, and it is still not debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go any further on this but I want to make the plea that at some stage&mdash;in the next parliament; not this one, I presume&mdash;we look at the way the House does business. I will not be here, but the House has to look at the way that it does business, and it has to change the 1900 methods that it uses, or else find a means by which it gives up pretending to pass legislation which in fact it does not pass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 is to remove uncertainties about the enforcement of laws concerning truth in labelling of Australian wine. In 1989 legislation to implement a wine label integrity program was carried in this House with the support of the coalition parties. The program was developed at industry request and required wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety and region of origin of the wine. These records were required to be made available for audit upon request by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first inspections were in the Clare Valley in South Australia in 1990, and no breaches were detected. However, over 200 audits have revealed certain technical deficiencies which make enforcement of the legislation difficult. The first is that, whilst the Act requires that records be kept, there is no requirement that these records be accurate and complete. The second is that the manufacturer must provide the records even if they are self-incriminating, but the manufacturer is then protected from prosecution should the records disclose false labelling. There is therefore doubt as to whether a successful prosecution concerning false labelling could be launched under the present Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill attempts to overcome these problems. There are four aspects to the legislation. First, it makes it an offence to knowingly or recklessly fail to make and keep such records, or to make and keep false, misleading or incomplete records. Secondly, it amends the section which requires a person to provide information to the Corporation on request, but indemnifies that person from prosecution where such information is furnished. The amendment removes the label integrity program provisions from section 42 but otherwise leaves the section unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it allows a person, with reasonable excuse, to refuse a request from the Corporation to provide records. It would be a reasonable excuse if the records were self-incriminating. Where a person chooses, with reasonable excuse, not to provide the records, the Corporation must obtain a warrant to obtain the records. This would allow those records to initiate a prosecution, thus achieving the original intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also enables the Corporation to retain records for 60 days or, if a prosecution for a label offence is initiated within 60 days, until proceedings and appeals are ended. A person will be able to inspect or copy the records given to the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Bill honours a commitment that the Government made to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills to enable a person to copy evidence seized by an inspector and it reduces the period of validity of an offence warrant from one month to a maximum of seven days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this legislation. I believe it indicates one of the very positive features of the Australian wine industry. Our wine industry is one of the great success stories of Australian industry at present. It does not matter whether one sees it as a primary industry, a manufacturing industry or one marketing a product. On behalf of the coalition parties I want to congratulate everybody associated with this very great industry in this country because it epitomises growth, and geographic and varietal diversity. Not only is production increasing but, because of where it is located in many different areas of Australia, it is providing some interesting developments and differences in variety and type of wine produced. The wine industry obviously has quality control as a high priority; hence this legislation. It is one of our best examples of value adding of a primary product. It is also one of the best examples of a growth industry for exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lesson for some other industries in relation to the organisation of the industry. In 1990 the Winemakers Federation of Australia came into being to bring together three different industry organisations. They now cover 95 per cent of production. As a result, the industry is now able to speak out on different issues of concern. Obviously, like any other industry, it has concerns. I quote from the 1990-91 report of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, which highlights the damage being done to the industry by invisible taxes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Taxation on domestic production bleeds into export costs as input items are inflated through a whole range of invisible taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of these invisible taxes should not be underestimated and have been estimated as high as 30 per cent of all taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In that report the industry made the point that one of its major challenges for the future and its ability to grow and prosper is to tackle issues such as taxation that will affect our capacity to remain internationally competitive. This, of course, is where the coalition's Fightback policy comes in. In a number of discussions with the industry, it has been very positive in relation to the impact of Fightback. Input taxes are removed under Fightback. As the industry indicated, there are many taxes that are more or less hidden at present, but they are there nevertheless. These taxes are removed under Fightback, which means that the industry can be more internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As production increases and the percentage of exports increases, that international competition requirement increases also, particularly where the Australian industry is competing against other countries which already have similar tax incentives. I think of New Zealand and France as two examples where, by having a GST or VAT system, those input taxes are removed. Of course, for exports the GST or VAT is fully rebated, and that is a very significant factor when one looks at the competitive situation of different countries and export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present there are hidden export taxes on our wine, as there are on every other export from Australia. That has been calculated as equivalent to a 5 per cent export tax. Senator Button has been quoted a few times today in this place, but to my knowledge he has never withdrawn his comment where, through his Department, he acknowledged that there is this export tax,  which has been calculated by Treasury at $1.8 billion per year. The French, the New Zealanders and others that have this system and where those inputs are rebated at the point of export have a considerable advantage over our wine exporters. That is one of the reasons why the wine industry is enthusiastic about Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the industry exported $234m worth of wine, which is a tenfold increase in six years. After something of a false start a few years ago, this export growth is very soundly based. It is anticipated that by the year 2000 the industry could be one of our major export earners, with $1 billion a year in export income for Australia. To achieve the growth that is necessary, more than $1 billion of investment will be required for vineyards, wineries, et cetera. One has to acknowledge that a number of those wineries are having cash flow problems. It is certainly not an easy industry for many individuals or companies at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other important features of the industry is that it is value adding to an excellent degree and in a logical and natural way. In a recent article by Andrew Clark in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, referring to developments in the industry in Europe he made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian wine export story is a successful grafting of old-fashioned business values with hi-tech.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that Australian wine is achieving a real premium on the British market because, while it only has 2.7 per cent in volume in that market, it has 12 per cent of wine costing more than $12.50 per bottle. The industry has a far better percentage in relation to the quality section of the market than the volume section, and that is what value adding is about. One can look at other markets where the Australian wine industry is increasing not only its volume of exports but also the value of those exports to an even greater degree. This comes back to the importance of quality control, with value adding, with brand marketing, and with responsibility for individual labels. That is why this legislation is being supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the wine industry does provide some very good lessons for other sections of the broader horticultural industry, where there is not the same reliability and quality with exports and there is not always an ability to value add. I take `value adding' to mean not just further processing but obtaining as high a price as possible for the raw product by gaining a premium for quality. Not all of those industries are as world competitive as the wine industry obviously is, from its record in exports and against some fairly fierce import competition. The coalition parties support the legislation and wish the wine industry a very successful and expanding future, not just in Australia but as one of the major export industries for this country in the coming years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1992, which seeks to remove some technical problems with the provisions of the Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 and to strengthen the laws covering truth in labelling of our wines. These are essential for the successful marketing of our product overseas. They may seem minor changes, but we will all recall the recent incidents in European countries where all kinds of substances found their way into wine bottles, to the disadvantage of those producing the wine. This may seem an extreme example, but it is pretty crucial that we maintain the confidence of overseas markets in the quality and integrity of our product. I note that this Bill enjoys the strong support of the major wine industry body, the Winemakers Federation of Australia. I am pleased to note the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) in support of the thrust of this amendment, although, since he made some critical comments about the present taxation regime, as is the custom in this House I will have to reciprocate with a few remarks about the Fightback package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry is just one of the success stories of Australia's manufacturing renaissance under the present Government. It is one of South Australia's key rural industries. We in South Australia have some major winegrowing areas in the Barossa and Clare valleys, in the Coonawarra in the State's south-east, at McLaren Vale just south of Adelaide, and in the Riverland, which is a major wine grape producer. The Adelaide Hills and Langhorne Creek are smaller producing areas but their wines are of no less quality for that. Many wine companies have their headquarters in my electorate, and I am pleased to see them there. </PARA>

Each of the major regions has good accommodation and fine restaurants which together contribute to a fine-living ambience that is attracting increasing numbers to South Australia and the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these regions stage regular gourmet festivals when famous Adelaide restaurants&mdash;and of course our restaurants also win many prizes&mdash;move for a weekend or perhaps slightly longer to temporary facilities at the wineries. The public is encouraged to move around and sample the different foods and wines that are available. I am hoping that plans presently being unveiled for a new international standard resort at the Barossa Valley will soon be finalised and that overseas visitors will come in greater numbers to enjoy these festivals. You will note, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Pheasant Farm in the middle of the Barossa always features very highly in the awarding of prizes for restaurants in Australia, and justly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our wine industry is world class and highly competitive. Its 97 per cent share of the Australian market represents a substantial turnaround from our position only 10 years ago when&mdash;it is very hard to believe; when researching this speech I was surprised when reminded of it&mdash;Australia was a net importer of wine. We are now a net exporter, with overseas sales accounting for 20 per cent of total production, and we have increased from negligible levels of just a few years ago to 77.6 million litres, which is worth $234m in 1991-92. The industry is now confident of achieving exports of wine worth $1 billion by the turn of the century and, given the burgeoning markets of well-off, well-earning middle-class people in the Asian economies to our north, as their consumption habits shift a bit more in our direction this is a very realistic goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add in passing that wine is an example of how our country has been helped by the immigration program of the last few decades. This industry has been substantially boosted in postwar years by the large number of continental European migrants who brought with them an established wine culture. Wolf Blass, whose headquarters are right in the middle of the central business district of Adelaide, is perhaps the best known of them. After the 1960s, as this culture struck firm roots, production shifted away from the old fortified wines such as port and sherry, which we had been traditionally used to, to table wines, which have now proven much more successful in the penetration of overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry is a good example of what this Federal Government is attempting to achieve with other rural industries. Because of the policies of former coalition governments, too many of the Australian primary industries were in the business of merely exporting raw products&mdash;grains, sugar, wool, iron ore, coal and natural gas. Because these are being transformed to finished products overseas, the returns to Australia in terms of value added have been limited. Our failure to add value in the past and its legacy have been a cause of our recent current account deficit problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will go a long way to eliminating this current account deficit if we can emulate the wine industry more widely. This wine industry is the result of various stages of production that are carried out in Australia&mdash;crushing, distilling, blending, packaging and so on&mdash;which add approximately seven times the farm gate value of the raw material to the finished product. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to imagine what the effect would be of adding seven times the value of the entire primary export crop of this country right across the board. Basically, in the wine industry this means that wages are paid to 10,000 Australian workers, $1.2 billion worth of sales to Australian retailers are cashed up, transport costs are paid to Australian transport companies, the costs of packaging materials are paid to Australian packagers, and also $400m worth of Commonwealth and State taxes are derived from the industry. This can be reinvested in our domestic economy in various ways and needs to be in capital equipment, building and financial services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in other industries that have been successful recently in breaking into overseas markets and lifting their export volumes, the Federal Government can claim at least some part in the success story of the wine industry as a result of the assistance that has been provided. I hasten to add that the bulk of the success story is attributable to the wine industry itself, but we have tried in our own way to provide assistance. In the five years to 1991, when exports from this industry had their exponential growth of more than 20 per cent per annum, the Australia Wine and Brandy Corporation and individual wine exporters received more than $20m in export market development grants, and more will follow as a result of the liberalisation of the eligibility for this scheme that was announced in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has also received grants worth more than $500,000 under the marketing skills program and the innovative agricultural marketing program, as well as more than $1m each year in research and development grants. In fact, the wine industry is seen by the Government as being so important that it has supported the establishment of a cooperative research centre for viticulture which will be funded to the tune of $14m over the next seven years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has tried to apply the same philosophy to the wine-making industry as it has to other industries. We have had a good look at the industry, made an assessment of the opportunities the industry says are available, and tried to respond to its needs by supplementing and assisting it with an intelligent package of measures suited to that industry, driven not by ideology or by the stated needs of the industry but by policy objectives on a national level supplementing what the industry requires. This is called government intervention, and in this industry it has been pretty successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am optimistic that a similar policy process can be developed with respect to other agricultural industries in this country with a view to producing processed food for export, particularly into Asia where the booming market provides plenty of opportunities for the import of processed food products from Australia. I think the opportunities are unlimited, but we will need considerable imagination to transform an agricultural primary producing base which has traditionally oriented itself towards the European market and culture to one which is oriented towards the growing and newly developing taste style of east Asia. But if we do not do that the industry will fade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry competes with French exports. This is difficult, but not because the French have a GST. The French have a GST because they could not collect any tax from their farmers. The farmers would not pay income tax because if one asked them what their income was they would say `Zilch; zero'. Since tax could not be collected from them in the form of income&mdash;which they claimed not to have&mdash;it had to be collected in the form of expenditure, which no-one thought was a good idea but it was the only way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having introduced it in France, when the European Community was formed it had to be introduced into every other country, including Germany, otherwise the other countries would have different tax collecting and, therefore, different economic structures. So in order to unify and make uniform the tax collecting system of the European Community&mdash;at that stage six countries&mdash;everybody got lumbered with a GST that was developed for the French farmers who had no income. There are now 14 countries in western Europe and other countries&mdash;one is New Zealand&mdash;applying this tax, although there was no need to apply it in the first place since they did not have an extensive peasant farming community that refused to pay income tax. But I digress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the success of French exports was initially that their wine enjoyed considerable reputation due to marketing and its quality over a period of years. We found it difficult to compete with them, that is true. But the important reason these days is that they are heavily subsidised, which we do not propose to do. However, we do propose to assist in the development of export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Opposition&mdash;since the Deputy Leader of the National Party said something about our taxation policy, it would be churlish of me not to reciprocate&mdash;has proposed a rather different orientation towards industry policy in this sector and in the wine industry. As in other sectors and so in the wine industry, the Fightback policy is rather one of leave it and let it die: if it cannot survive without government assistance, then it should not survive at all. I note that the Opposition's then spokesman on trade, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), foreshadowed in 1990 the elimination by 1995 of the export market development scheme and others like it&mdash;which, as I have pointed out, assisted the wine industry considerably in breaking into foreign markets. This is somewhat surprising, given that the electorate of Mayo contains some significant wine growing areas. Some of them are extremely quality oriented in their production. But perhaps the winemakers of the Adelaide Hills and Langhorne Creek were unaware of that posture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also point out that the Cooperative Research Centre for Viticulture would likewise appear at risk under the Fightback package. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the shadow Minister for science and technology, is of the view that the CRCs are of questionable value. He also has the research and development project in his sights and wants to reduce this by $100m a year by dropping the concession from a 150 per cent to a 125 per cent write-off. The wine research would suffer proportionately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry will be offered two separate packages at the next election, each having a different orientation. It has seen the success under ours. If it wants to, it can take its chances under the Opposition's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I might add in this context that I recently attended the national conference of the Australian Winemakers Federation, held in the foothills of Adelaide in an extraordinarily pleasant old winery which had been converted to a dining room. The major discussion that was held during and shortly after lunch was a panel discussion of whether the industry could export $1 billion worth of product by year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was extraordinarily impressed with the detail and sophistication of the discussion which followed. This was not at an abstract or theoretical level but was at a very particular level and was extraordinarily detailed. The members broke down the rate of growth that would be required to be sustained over the next eight years, the rate of market penetration of which varieties of wine at which prices, and approximated the market growth in Europe, Asia, Africa and elsewhere. The discussion was very lively and, as is their want, was quite colourful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general agreement seemed to be that we would need about $1.2 billion worth of investment in the industry to achieve a billion dollars per annum exports of wine by year 2000, and that these investments would need to be made in approximately these proportions: about $600m in new land brought into the industry; about $460m in inventory; and $120m in new equipment. They raised some of the problems which the Deputy Leader of the National Party referred to about raising this cash, which would be difficult to generate within the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They would probably be looking for large investors, possibly banks, but more likely the large insurance funds which are coming onto the market in this country, as the means of raising the investment required. In addition, they thought that the old stocks of vines would need to be grafted with new varietals. I noted that the six largest wineries would need, as they do now, to do most of the exporting, but they felt that the smaller quality exporters would still need to get into the marketplace in order to enhance the reputation of Australian wines as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, they felt that the industry enjoyed natural advantages of having extensive land and a pollution free product. Because of the high research and technology levels, which Australia is acknowledged so widely throughout the world as possessing, they felt that we should engage in the export of technology. During the conference, I was contemplating how many industries in this country actually export their technology. Acknowledging that it is in the forefront of the industry on a worldwide basis, I could not come up with too many others. Certainly, that is the way that the winemakers see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was even discussion around the table at which I was sitting about whether there ought to be some check on the export of this technology which was enabling the foreigners to catch up rather quickly. So I will draw this to the attention of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), as he is in the House. The general feeling was that $1 billion worth of product exported by year 2000 was an achievable goal which could be mapped, as progress was made towards it, and be realistically achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happily note that in this objective South Australia and its quality wineries around the metropolitan area of Adelaide, and also the bulk producing area of the Riverland, will play a huge&mdash;and I hope a disproportionately huger&mdash;role over the next decade. In other words, this industry is a credit to both Australia and to the proportion of it which exists in South Australia, the State from which I am a representative. I commend to this House this amendment which will assist that State. </PARA>

I was interested in what the honourable member for Adelaide had to say about the GST. I found his explanation for the existence of a consumption tax in Europe very interesting, to say the least. I knew the French farmers were powerful, but I did not know that they were so powerful that they could affect the whole of Europe in the way that they were taxed. Needless to say, the wine grape growers and the winemakers, particularly those who are interested in export, would greatly welcome, and welcome with open arms, the introduction of the GST, because it would take a tremendous amount of tax off their production and also off their export sales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 legislation was passed to implement a wine label integrity program. This was done with coalition support. The program was developed at industry request and required wine manufacturers to keep records to support labelling claims of the vintage, variety and region of origin of the wine. These records must be made available for audit upon request by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two hundred audits have shown that there were technical deficiencies, which have made the enforcement of legislation difficult. This Act, which we are speaking about tonight, helps to overcome this problem, as other members have already stated in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would know, anything that assists the integrity of our wine industry is of the utmost importance. According to the industry funded Wine Export Council, Australian wine producers&mdash;and the honourable member for Adelaide has already touched on this&mdash;can expect to boost export sales from the current $234m to $1 billion by the year 2000. That is an extraordinary increase. It helps our balance of payments figures and is wonderful for those people who are in the wine industry, and for the Treasury of Australia and Australia generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas sales have increased seven-fold since 1986. That is remarkable in itself. This has been due to a massive marketing effort which has seen sales surge in the British, Swedish and United States markets. Not only has the volume of sales of wines increased, but the wines have gained international recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year we are running significantly ahead of last year's impressive record. Our wines are internationally respected and recognised. We are also known as the lowest cost producer of varietal table wines in the world. One of the greatest assets, and this relates to the quality and labelling, is the cleanliness of the Australian product. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has already been made here of how free of pollution this nation is, particularly in its agricultural and horticultural areas. If I may be parochial in relation to the Riverina, because that is what I would like to speak about tonight, I will inform the House of the implementation of a low chemical grape and wine production called Riverina Clean. I do not know whether honourable members are aware that the Riverina is the second largest wine region in Australia. It is certainly the largest in New South Wales. I think a lot of people, when they talk about wines, tend to forget the Riverina. We produce 66 per cent of Australia's semillon, 20 per cent of its shiraz, and 20 per cent of the total wine output of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Riverina we have a hot, dry area which has to be irrigated. There is a low disease risk. There are low levels of artificial inputs, especially fungicides. Local growers are encouraged to control and monitor the use of chemical inputs in grapes and wine. The first crop to be used in the vintage&mdash;of course, there have been trials&mdash;will be available as Riverina Clean in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might ask, `Why is the Riverina noted for its wine? Why is it that the Riverina grows grapes to produce wine?'. In the Riverina, our major resource is our people. We have people from diverse European cultures. We have Italians with their horticultural skills and we have the Australian resourcefulness. This has benefited viticulture and oenology. The stable climate, modern wineries and the varietal wine plantings give the region national and international success. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, 66 per cent is semillon. We also have sufficient plantings for shiraz, colombard and gewurtztraminer wines. They are full-bodied, ripe, and are moderate in their alcohol content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most famous wines produced in the Riverina today, because of the mild, humid, warm autumns, are the botrytis wines. These are formed by the infection of the botrytis. This increases the sugar to extraordinary levels and it gets its own distinctive&mdash;and as we call it&mdash;`noble' flavour and aroma. Since 1982 botrytis semillon has been recognised as one of the best sweet wines of the world. Five countries&mdash;France, Germany, Hungary, Austria and Australia&mdash;produce this type of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the wines that stand out is the DeBortoli wine, but DeBortoli is not the only winery in the Riverina. It is interesting to note that most of the wineries are family-owned concerns. We have Cranswick Smith, DeBortoli, LillyPilly, the famous McWilliams, Miranda Wines, Riverina Wines, Rossetto Wines, Toorak Wines, West End Wines and Wilton Estates. Many people say, `We didn't know that the Riverina produced wines'. While we are talking about the Riverina, it is interesting to note that Henry Lawson worked in Leeton in 1916. This is what he said about the Riverina:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a spread of green, all chequered off, with little homes, and trees, and clear, green fringed canals and channels&mdash;just like English brooks&mdash;set in the midst of a bare, scorching, dusty red and parched yellow Dead Land that's a lot older than Egypt.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no problem in placing a DeBortoli sauterne alongside Penfolds grange hermitage, the great north-eastern Victorian fortified muscats and tokays, the 20-year-old Lindemans semillons, the similarly aged Leo Buring Rhine rieslings, and the best Petaluma chardonnays as Australia's greatest wine styles. I am very proud to stand here in the Parliament and say that these wines of the Riverina are equal to the world's best. I spoke earlier about the need to have a clean product. I was concerned the other day to receive a letter from the CSIRO which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may have seen or heard recent media reports to the effect that CSIRO's Division of Entomology is in financial crisis and proposes to close several programs and declare up to 35 of its staff redundant so that the Divisional budget can be balanced within the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that there have been cutbacks all over the place because of the recession we are facing and the problems our economy is now attempting to overcome, but I think it is very foolish to cut research and development, particularly in this area. The horticultural industry spends millions of dollars every year on chemicals to control insect pests such as codling moth, oriental fruit moth, budworms and other leaf rollers. Failure to use chemicals results in infested fruit which is unmarketable. Market demands plus environmental concerns mean that it is necessary to reduce pesticide usage urgently, including in wine grapes. Some growers are already attempting to do this. For instance, the Apple and Pear Growers Association has been a leader in the push to find alternatives to pesticides. As I said earlier, in the Riverina we are trying to produce `Riverina fresh' with reduced pesticides and reduced chemicals in winemaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists have responded to the need for alternative control methods by looking closely at nature to find ways to control pests. One of the most promising areas of research has been the study of pheromones&mdash;natural secretions of female moths which are used for communication. The idea is to use synthetic pheromones to mix the signals produced by females and therefore disrupt mating. The method is clean, green and plays a key role in alternative pest control technology. It can be used in conjunction with other forms of biological control such as insect growth regulators or biological control agents to keep the number of pests down using reduced amounts of or no chemicals. Research has reached the point where already one form of pheromone, Isomate M, has been commercialised by the Australian company Biocontrol Ltd and is available to farmers. Isomate M is a pheromone dispenser system developed from CSIRO research that is used against oriental fruit moth in peach orchards in Australia, the USA and France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My plea here tonight is to ask the Government, and of course the leaders of the CSIRO, to think very seriously about this funding cutback. I am not sure whether honourable members are aware that Australian scientists are leaders in this pheromone technology research. As I have said, one company has already taken up the cudgels to produce pheromone and export it. Honourable members can imagine the great benefit it has in saving insecticides, in confusing these insect pests and in making a much better product that is much cheaper and much cleaner. This refers not only to the apple and pear industry&mdash;the pome fruits&mdash;but also to the grape industry, and I believe there is some research going on in the sugar industry. I believe that pheromone is limitless in its possibilities for the control of insect pests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I have risen to support this amendment to the Act.

The Bill amends the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 to include as a schedule to the Act the agreement made on 11 May this year between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and a number of Premiers and Chief Ministers. It follows the agreement made between the Premiers and Chief Ministers at the Adelaide conference from which the former Prime Minister was excluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the functions of the National Road Transport Commission relate to obtaining uniformity in road transport; that is, it applies only to those vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes, which are known as heavy vehicles. Its functions include seeking uniform legislation, road charges and road user charges, principles for determining road charges and road use charges, and guidelines for the preparation of regulatory impact statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional functions that have been conferred on the Commission by the agreement in May include the extension of the Commission's functions to light vehicles, that is, those under 4 1/2 tonnes, the assembly and publication of information on road-related charges applying to light vehicles, the assistance in developing indicators for assessing the performance of the road system and matters related to that performance&mdash;for example, are our road constructors efficient?&mdash;the assembly and publication of information on road safety, and the monitoring of the use of alternative fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the National Road Transport Commission are not to be extended to road charges or economic regulation of the transport industry in this area. It is clear that the Government did not want to lose its influence over the taxation of motorists, and I think this highlights the basic flaw in the Government's approach to this whole matter. It is clear that the Government has not been serious about getting as close as possible to the ideal charging system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Government was not prepared to sacrifice its milch powers over road users in order to achieve the most appropriate road transport reform. It is clear, because of this, that the charging regime recommended by the National Road Transport Commission for heavy vehicles is not the best possible because of the constraints that the Government placed on the Commission. I quote from the April 1992 Discussion Paper on Heavy Vehicle Charges put out by the National Road Transport Commission. When the NRTC was talking about sales tax, an area that the Government was not too keen to have publicised, the Commission, to its credit, made the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence on the relative level of sales tax payed by the road transport industry was discussed in Section 3.4. Based on that evidence, the Commission considers that the amounts payed are excessive, especially given the "intermediate good" nature of road transport. Further, the level of sales tax has either been reduced, or a reduction is under active consideration, for many other areas of industry in general.</PARA>
<PARA>To the credit of the NRTC, it was prepared to put this into the public debate. It shows very clearly that the Government is not serious about getting the costs of transport down. It highlights, of course, the benefits under the Fightback package where in fact we address that very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on with the NRTC's recommendations. Given the problems that I have already highlighted, it is worth observing that in its road user charge the Government has highlighted the fact that the 18c a litre is a notional charge, which really means it is a bit illusionary and is not related to anything as far as road construction or road spending is concerned. We could go so far as to say that the figure does not do a lot other than give the Government a warm inner glow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that I am not criticising the work of the National Road Transport Commission, but the Government is using the NRTC and is not really serious about addressing the whole problem of road funding. As I have said, it has highlighted the 18c a litre notional charge, and yet this will not be given to roads. It is, in other words, just another general revenue tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, it is worth noting that the Government has said that it will continue to index the tax component. That means that the notional 8c a litre could become 16c a litre within a few short years, given Labor's record in this area. Of course, if Labor were around for long enough&mdash;and I am sure that the good people of Australia will realise that that is not in their best interests&mdash;it could mean that road transport operators would be paying up to 34c per litre to the Government every time they filled up their trucks. Yet on present indications, only about 5c of that would go back to roads. It is clear that as long as the Government can continue to use road users as a source of general revenue by having only a notional charge, then an adequate level of road funding cannot be assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that the Government really has an appalling record on road funding. For all its years in office, bar 1992-93, road funding has fallen dramatically in real terms. This is despite the huge increases of around 150 per cent in the revenue gained through fuel excise. The $2 billion roads program&mdash;of which $600m was announced in February and $1.4 billion was announced late in July in the annual Budget allocation&mdash;means that the Government has belatedly acknowledged that our roads are sorely in need of an additional injection of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this funding only brings us back to the level of where we were a decade ago. There has been a decade of neglect under the Labor Party. I think all of us know of many examples of that. One has only to drive around any part of the country to see that roads which seven or eight years ago were in quite good condition are today becoming increasingly rough. In fact, a number of councils have been forced to rip up sealed roads because they can no longer afford to maintain that asset. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This demonstrates that the Government has shown little interest in roads, particularly in rural roads. This latest bout of funding announced in February really is just an attempt to buy votes. I warn the motorists of Australia not to be fooled, because if Labor has the chance it will cut funding back again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth considering the record of Labor governments and looking very quickly at the now failed, dismissed, government from Victoria, the Cain-Kirner Government. We find that in the last Budget&mdash;the Budget that the Labor Government never actually allowed to be debated&mdash;there was an $18m cutback on the road network in Victoria. This shows that there had been cuts not only at a Federal level but even at a State level. This was on top of previous years where there had been cutbacks in a number of years. Anyone who studies what has happened to the roads in Victoria will know just how serious the situation is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the National Road Transport Commission has done its best to get around the constraints that the Government has been placing on it in trying to devise an appropriate road user charge. It took on board many of the concerns that the coalition had when its first lot of legislation was introduced last year&mdash;for example, by reviewing the sales tax burden, a matter that I have already alluded to. This legislation, of course, deals with other</PARA>
<PARA>concerns that were raised by the coalition last year. One of those concerns was the ability of the NRTC to help assess the performance of the road system and the efficiency and the effectiveness of road authorities. It also deals with another concern, that is, the taxes and road related charges that have been applying to light vehicles. I think this shows that the coalition has indeed been leading the debate on this and has not been frightened to put forward the right ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will go further and will stop using road users as a milch cow. For too long the road users of this country have been milked for tax, and I do not think there would be one member of the Government who would deny that. We intend to abolish seven taxes, four of which impact directly on road transport and motorists&mdash;namely fuel excise, sales tax, payroll tax and customs duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury analysis&mdash;and I emphasise this is the Treasury's analysis of the road transport savings&mdash;says that the abolition of payroll tax would save road transport around $121m a year. The abolition of the fuel excise will save around $679m a year and the abolition of the wholesale sales tax will save road transport around $408m a year. All of this can be translated into what it means for an individual truck. I seek leave to have a table incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This table compares the coalition and the Government on estimations of taxation on long distance road transport operators. It shows very clearly that there are massive savings as a result of the way the coalition will get the tax off road users. If honourable members look at this table, they will see that the saving is in excess of $40,000 per year. I suggest that that is what real road reform is about&mdash;trying to get the cost of transport down in this country. While some moves that have been initiated through the NRTC are welcome, the fact is that there is an awful lot more still to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these figures that the Treasury did in its analysis were considered rather conservative by the industry. In fact, some in the industry suggest that the savings under the Fightback package could be up to double those cited. That is a very significant boost to the nation through getting the cost of transport down. It is not just for heavy vehicles or trucks; we will also have big savings for motorists. As all honourable members must be aware by now, we are talking about 19c a litre, or around $11 every time a motorist fills up an average family car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the important point to note about the NRTC is that it is seen as an independent body, but it has been given a flawed charter within which to work. Nonetheless, it has done its best, given those limitations. The coalition intends to do the proper job and give the NRTC a clean slate to deal with; in other words, it will remove all these taxes and then ask the NRTC to do its job properly. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important point to recognise is that we are dedicated to getting the cost of transport down. We recognise that this is a very large country, that we are more dependent on transport than almost any other country, particularly given the size of our population and that, therefore, we must have the most cost efficient and best transport system that we can have. As we all know, transport is a major part of our daily lives. It impacts on us every day. Getting that cost down is so important. That is why the Fightback package goes out of its way to get the taxes off road transport, which is something that the Government would do well to emulate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, we have also made it very clear that we will return all revenue raised from road user charges. This is something that the Government still fails to understand. As I have pointed out, the Government has made a notional allocation out of its current fuel tax, and it is nothing more than notional. It is not dedicated to roads. I believe that it is just a way of easing the Government's conscience to make it look as though it is doing something. It continues to refuse to return that revenue to roads. I believe that the NRTC itself is less than flattering in some of its comments on the Government's approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is very determined to get the politics out of roads, as I said before. We want to get the politics out and allow the road needs to be assessed on an ongoing and stable basis so that we can allow some real planning for the future instead of turning the tap on and off, as the Government has done. We have seen the run-down over the last few years and then a sudden rush of blood in February. Those opposite say, `We must be seen to be doing something so we'll have a big spend up'. This stop-start nature not only means that we are not getting the best decisions being made; we are also not getting the best value for money. Anyone who is involved in road construction will say that it is continuity that allows the real economies to be made. If we have this stop-start approach, often the equipment that is being applied is not necessarily the best and often, with some spending programs, there is a rush to be seen to be doing something and, therefore, the money is not always spent in the most effective and efficient manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to note, in the context of the broader agenda of micro-economic reform, that the labour market reform, which will be so important for the future of this country over the next decade, will yield very significant benefits to the road transport industry as a whole when we have a change of government. There is no doubt that, given more flexible working hours, we will be able to reduce the congestion in our cities. I believe this in itself will save not only time for the people doing business but also a lot of fuel. If we can reduce congestion, obviously we can reduce the amount of fuel, and that in itself will help to reduce some of the pollution that occurs in our cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that this policy will create an expansion of the economy which will lead to more business for road transport. Again, we will be making a positive contribution to dealing with some of the problems facing this nation. Clearly, there are some significant savings to be made by improving the efficiency of road construction and road maintenance. The coalition is committed to getting these efficiency gains, and our agenda, as has been pointed out so clearly, will help achieve this very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition is not opposing this Bill, but we do have a very different approach to the whole question of road transport. I believe it is a very much superior approach to that of the Government. But the most important and overriding factor is that we are really on about getting the cost of transport down in this nation, and getting it down significantly. It is only by doing that that we can help to improve the wealth generation, which we all know is so desperately needed in order to create new jobs for so many people who have lost them. I believe that the coalition has a vastly superior policy. It is one of which all members on this side of the House are very proud. It is one that will certainly offer Australia a much better future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in this debate. I am also pleased to take part in this debate. I was quite interested in some of the comments of the honourable member for Wannon. He said that the Opposition wants a cost effective transport system and that it will have real road planning. But I wonder how it will do that. We heard much about the taxes that were to be taken off and how much the price of fuel was going to come down. We heard a comment about the road user charge, but we are yet to see the documentation to find out what the real amount of road user charges will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wannon said that the Opposition was looking for an ideal charging mechanism. We would like to know what this ideal charging mechanism is in the Opposition's view. It most certainly is not mentioned in Fightback. Why will members of the Opposition not say what the road user charge will be for heavy vehicles? I heard the honourable member for Wannon say that the Opposition was interested in more business for road transport. That is okay. But I think, if we are going to talk about an integrated transport system in Australia, perhaps we should be looking to take some of the heavy vehicles off our roads and have more heavy freight transported by rail rather than always putting it on the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear many things in this chamber. Sometimes we are really amazed and sometimes we think we are in a different country from the speaker. I heard the honourable member make the comment that this Government had an appalling record on road funding. I could not believe it. I guess we all get a little parochial, and I can talk only about the area I represent. When I first came to this Parliament, with the advent of the Labor Government&mdash;and I drive to and from Canberra&mdash;I would drive my car to Canberra, as you would too, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you drive to Canberra, and I would have to trundle through Mittagong, competing with the heavy vehicles; through Berrima, where there was an accident two or three times a week; through Goulburn, where there is a heavy vehicle every 60 seconds, as the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) keeps quoting; along the Federal Highway to Canberra, where I would get behind trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened now? I drove down here this morning. Mittagong is bypassed, and the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) was up there opening the bypass the other week; Berrima was bypassed a couple of years back; and the Goulburn bypass will be opened by Christmas. Further south, the Cullerin Range deviation will be opened in the not too distant future. So where is this appalling record? Certainly, in my electorate it is not an appalling record. When I go around Australia on parliamentary duties I see fine roads, especially the national highway. I am always amazed at this story that councils are ripping up roads, and the funding is not Federal funding to start with. The Opposition can never say which councils are ripping up roads. The honourable member for Wannon could not say that this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that the Opposition is not opposing the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill. There is not a lot that it could oppose in it because this Bill amends the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and gives effect to the light vehicles agreement formulated at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in May 1992. The agreement involves a regime for vehicles weighing 4.5 tonnes or less, their drivers, other road users and related matters. This will expand the powers and functions of the National Road Transport Commission to include regulation of all motorised vehicles and not just those vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes. In addition, the Commission shall exercise responsibility for policy development for light vehicles, excluding the determination of charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Road Transport Commission was formally established at the beginning of this year. Anyone concerned with transport in Australia would understand how it was hailed as a major step towards achieving fundamental and lasting reforms of road transport&mdash;reforms that would benefit all Australians as a result of a more efficient road transport industry sector. For the economic well-being of this country, it is essential that Australia has a proper transport infrastructure. This should cover not only roads but also rail, air and sea. We often see projects come on without an adequate transport infrastructure. I know in the Illawarra area a few years back that the coal loader there was built without an adequate transport network, neither road nor rail. We have suffered ever since. I believe it is essential that we have an adequate transport network in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, our road transport has been governed by a myriad of different regulations, including the basics of travel rules, regulations and laws. How many people have driven interstate and been faced with confusing and potentially dangerous situations of when to give way, when to turn to the right, or who has the right of way? Small things in themselves, but potentially very dangerous&mdash;especially to a confused driver in a different State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management and development of the regulations covering light vehicles has meant duplication of work amongst States. The National Road Transport Commission will play a significant role in facilitating and ensuring continued cooperation amongst the States and Territories to reach a solution to these problems. It will create the basis for a nationally consistent legislative framework which will streamline administration processes in government bureaucracies across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clearly benefits in a consistent national approach to roadworthiness, standards for all vehicles and the administration of these standards. A truly national registration scheme would also facilitate exchange of information on defective vehicles. When we are talking about defective vehicles, I am always reminded of the very bad bus accident in southern New South Wales a few years ago. This bus had been passed as roadworthy in South Australia; at that time it did not meet the standards in New South Wales. Many times in the past a truck or bus in one State would be passed as roadworthy and be free to travel anywhere in Australia. Indeed, some drivers or owners of buses and trucks would have their vehicles registered in a particular State because they knew that it was easier to get it registered there than in another State. As has been shown, not only were they potentially dangerous; they were dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would also be safety benefits in achieving consistent traffic regulations for all vehicles covering road rules, signing and speed limits. Consistent registration and regulation systems and procedures would also facilitate checks on stolen vehicles. We all know how important this is because stolen vehicles in Australia cost this country millions of dollars a year. Anything that can at least trace these vehicles is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian governments have made considerable investment of taxpayers' funds in roads, especially this Labor Government which I believe has a record second to none in the amount of funds allocated to roads. But this investment, or the asset from the investment, requires constant maintenance and upgrading. An important function of the Commission will be to assist in the development of indicators that can provide better ways of assessing how we, as a nation, are coping with this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission will collect and publish information on important issues affecting road transport. Information will be assembled and published on a comparative assessment of the performance of road authorities and systems. This will assist all levels of government by providing a better, more balanced view on delivery of road funding programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), looking at the efficiency of the road construction and maintenance industry, I know how important this is. Over the last year we have spoken with many road authorities and appreciate how important and beneficial this monitoring process will be in giving us the best return for the taxpayers' dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that this is an aspect that worries me considerably about the Opposition's proposal on its goods and services as it applies to road transport. Members of the Opposition are boasting that they will cut the cost of fuel, but nowhere have they indicated to anyone's satisfaction how roads will be funded. There is, of course, the hidden tax&mdash;the $6 billion hole in the Opposition's Fightback program. To continue road funding and maintenance at its current level&mdash;a level that members of the Opposition are always criticising is not enough&mdash;they would have to slug road users massively on road user charges. They do not say how much it will be, but it will be anything between $17,000 and $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wannon produced a table this evening. It did not show what the road user tax would be on these trucks and it did not show the increased car registration which, in most States, would be more than double. A person will pay more than double for car registration and will be hit with a road user tax. It is no good arguing against that. Those opposite could not achieve the funding for roads that we are achieving today without a massive road user charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for those opposite to come in here and say that they will abolish seven taxes. A couple of them are State taxes and a couple of them are taxes which do not even apply to road users. They are not saying, and they must come clean on this, how much they are going to hit the motorists of Australia, the trucking industry of Australia. It surprises me that the honourable member for Wannon has spoken about this matter this evening. Why has the trucking industry not embraced the Opposition's proposal? The reason is that the trucking industry is terrified. If the honourable member for Wannon does not believe that the trucking industry is terrified, I invite him to come down to the Illawarra, talk to any of the coal truck owner drivers, explain to them about the road user charge and defend the drivers down there. Kenworth drivers will pay an additional $30,000 a year. Others will pay from $17,000 to $30,000 a year. I invite anyone from the Opposition to come to the Illawarra, but especially the honourable member for Wannon. I will line up the Kenworth owners and he can explain to them where they will find the additional $30,000 that they will have to pay in road user charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important role for the Commission will be to monitor the use of alternative fuels&mdash;something that we have not done enough of in this country&mdash;and publish information on road safety. Successful and lasting reforms which will facilitate a better, more efficient road transport environment have been a priority for this Government. The expansion of the terms of reference of the Commission to include light vehicles is certain to bring benefit to all Australians. I have much pleasure in commending this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that Australia is a nation on wheels. When we go on the roads today and see the increase in the traffic, we realise how important it is to have efficient road transport and that our roads are good. This will certainly be reflected in the economy of the nation and it will certainly be reflected in the safety of the people who are travelling on the roads. Australia is a country divided into States. Each State has its own responsibility with regard to registration and traffic rules generally and road taxes of certain kinds. I know that as Australia has grown the Minister and, I assume, the State transport Ministers have seen the opportunity to bring about uniformity and recognised that there should be uniformity between the States and the Commonwealth in many aspects of road transport and passenger services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a very large continent, and perhaps we have done particularly well in building a national highway around the country and in regard to our other arterial roads and our rural and urban road systems generally. It has been very important that this be achieved. Because we are a nation on wheels, we depend greatly on efficient transport. As we are being squeezed in terms of our competitiveness with the rest of the world we are realising more and more that we have to be efficient, we have to tighten up and we have to have some uniformity throughout Australia. That is why the Opposition supports the National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill. There is much that we can say about it because it is very important. The bottom line is that we need better roads&mdash;we all know this&mdash;and a more efficient transport system generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important factors that we have to keep in mind is road safety. There has not been a lot said in the debate so far concerning road safety and the confusion that can occur when crossing the border from one State to another because the rules in one State are different from the rules in the State that one has just left. One has to be conversant with those rules and know which are applicable to the State in which one is travelling, and one has to know the rules of the road generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Road safety is a very important factor. Too many people are dying on our roads. It concerns me that many people die not on the most dangerous sections or the black spots&mdash;as the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) would explain, he is providing specific finance for some of these areas of our highways and arterial roads&mdash;but on the straight stretches. I wonder whether our driving rules and the training and experience that our drivers have, particularly the young people, are sufficient for the modern requirements of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other parts of the world, in Europe, England and the United States of America, we find that older countries that have much more transport than we do and many more vehicles on their roads perhaps have better drivers. Now that we have a uniformity between the States and the Commonwealth is involved, I hope that the Commission will look very closely at teaching our people to drive properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians who are getting on in years have never driven a motor car. When someone's husband dies and a vehicle remains in the garage, the wife he leaves behind may be afraid to use the vehicle because she has never had to drive. Such people are frightened and nervous of going out on the road. They are nervous because of the accidents and near accidents which occur on the roads around our countryside. I hope that greater emphasis will be placed on learning to drive and that more stringent requirements will be imposed to make people aware that they are not the only ones on the road; that there are others around the corner, on their right or their left, of whom they must be very careful indeed. I hope those two factors of road safety and driver training will be addressed further in the future. I trust that this will be a requirement of the Commission once it gets into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Licensing, regulations and advice on the funding of roads are covered in the Bill. I wonder how this will be done. We do not want a duplication of what we have at present. As the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker),  said earlier this evening, roads are a political thing. We cannot afford to have them too political. We need an independent body that recognises where our future lies. We need better roads such as the Pacific Highway, which we know will be extended over the years to come. We need a body which plans adequately for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not fully conversant at the moment with what is occurring between the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Communications and the State traffic authorities and as to how far their planning for the future goes. I hope that these things can be addressed and that we do not get a duplication; that our National Road Transport Commission does not take the form of a great big bureaucracy. We must be very careful of this. I see that the Ministers involved will have to meet at least once a year and will keep a close eye under the legislation on the expenditure and the operations of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about road building, which I believe is very important. As one who travels country roads quite a deal, I feel that insufficient research has been done into the proper way to build a road. Having served on a local council with a good engineer, I know the value of a good engineer to a council. He can build a road: this is the important thing. That might seem a simple thing to do, but it is not easy to get the aggregate for the road and see that it is spread out properly, to see that the drainage is right, to ensure that the camber is correct and to see that the road is safe generally. I do not think sufficient research is undertaken even now to ensure that our roads are built properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, a lot of work is being done on the Pacific Highway. Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would agree with me that much of that work is being done very quickly by private contractors. There are various sections which cannot always be seen from the existing highway because they are in the bush on the sides. Many of the turns and so forth are being cut out, which is great to see. The area between Nabiac and Taree is a typical example. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that section of the road as you have been to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great savings can be achieved if more road works can be let out to private enterprise. State road traffic authorities&mdash;and I see them in operation in various parts of the States&mdash;receive a certain amount of money per year. They do not like to put staff off. In addition, we see valuable machinery sitting at the sides of roads not being used. This country cannot afford this. We have to be efficient. The Government is trying to build up efficiency and we in the Opposition support it in this regard. As I said earlier, to make this country competitive, we must be efficient in getting our goods to the wharves and from there overseas to the markets for which our farmers and industries are producing. We have to pay even more attention than we are now to letting our works out to private contractors to get the job done quickly, and we should encourage local government bodies to do the same thing in their bridge work and their kerbing and guttering work, as is being done in the telecommunications area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will find otherwise that a road traffic authority or the Department of Main Roads, or whatever it happens to be that is receiving a certain amount of money, will want to keep its plant there and its staff engaged. It will therefore spread that out over a period. I might be wrong; I have not got the evidence. I make that comment only because of what I have seen on the sides of the roads, but it irks me tremendously when I see valuable plant sitting idle and not being worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I asked one of the contractors on the job doing major work how things were going. He said that they were doing quite all right but that, as contractors doing a job, they were often held up because of the supervision they have from the State authorities. Everything has to be tested. They have to wait for somebody to make a decision. It is often hard&mdash;I am sure the Minister finds this at times&mdash;to get a person who is sitting in an office to go out and do a test and to make a decision and say, `This is what we intend to do'. These are all factors that I believe must be addressed if we are going to get value for the dollar we spend on the roads. That is important because it is intermingled with the general economy of the country, and I want to stress those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister, when he is responding, to advise whether we can assume that this will not affect the toll road systems. If the States want to continue on, even with uniformity, are they free to do this? Will they also be free to impose their own petrol tax? If we happen to get into government, they will not have to do so, and I think that will happen. Perhaps the Minister will not have to answer that because it is a foregone conclusion. But these are things people will ask me, and I think they are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, I think the legislation is in order, as long as it does its job effectively and as long as we can teach people to drive better, to give them greater safety upon the road, and build better roads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief contribution in support of this amendment to the Act and, in doing so, to express my congratulations to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), for the way he has been able to progress the reform of the road structure through the establishment of the National Road Transport Commission, moving it a step forward through this amendment tonight. I also want to talk more broadly about the formation of the National Rail Corporation, which is integral to the role of road and rail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to hear the contribution of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), which I think was totally in accord with the Government's view. However, in the last minute or so of his speech I think he let the cat out of the bag. He is widely respected in the Opposition ranks as an expert in road funding, and I distinctly heard him ask the Minister if it would be on for private toll roads to charge their own petrol tax. He did not mean to say petrol tax; he meant to say road user charge. This is going to be a key point of the whole debate, so I thank the honourable member for Lyne for letting the cat out of the bag and revealing just that little bit more about the plan to make up for the lost petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister will have picked up that the honourable member for Lyne mentioned significant contracting out to the private sector for the construction of roads. This all leads us to more and more private roads, privately constructed and privately owned. Now we are starting to hear about privately charged petrol tax. I want to come back to that, but I do not want to lose my train of thought. I am a little excited about this point because I think it could take us somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I started by mentioning the Road Transport Commission and the National Rail Corporation. I do not think anyone in this place should lose sight of the magnitude of the reforms that are reflected. We hear the Opposition talk frequently about the problems on Australia's waterfront, never acknowledging that over 20 years manpower on the waterfront has been reduced from 27,000 to 2,700. When the Industry Commission&mdash;God bless its soul&mdash;did an assessment of efficiency problems in the Australian economy, it also determined that the waterfront reforms that were needed in capital equipment, plant, layout and manpower issues cost the economy $1 billion per annum. That is the worth of fixing up the waterfront, and this Government recognises that and has moved on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same Industry Commission has determined that the road-rail imbalance and the misuse of resources are worth something in the vicinity of $6 billion to $8 billion per annum. It is not nearly as sexy and it is not an issue that Opposition members wander around talking about. All they ever want to say out in the country is, `We need more road funds'. They have never addressed the fact that it is six times the problem of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to that imbalance between road and rail, to put it in very simple terms, it has never made sense to have 2,000 trucks, day and night, going up and down the Hume Highway between Melbourne and Sydney parallel to the standard gauge railway line and competing with rail for freight. It has never made sense for one single truck to haul a load across the Nullarbor when one train is equivalent to 90 or 100 trucks. That kind of imbalance between long distance and short distance transport is what a lot of these reforms have been about, and dramatic progress is being made in tackling that $6 billion to $8 billion problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, through the Premiers Conference agreement, for the first time in the history of this nation the States have come to accept that the Federal Government should take up the role of coordinating these activities. The formation of the National Road Transport Commission last year was the major step in setting the road transport process going, in coordinating vehicle weights, speed limits, all the things that the heavy transport industry is continually facing when it crosses State boundaries. That was the first issue that had to be dealt with. The Minister went through an extensive and dramatic process of negotiation to reach the point where we formed the Commission, and in this legislation we are extending the brief. The brief contains some highly significant developments because it is now moving gently towards the issue of vehicles under 4.5 tonnes. It is not taking over at this point the regulation and operation of that field, but it is starting to look to the development of national legislation, which will be cooperatively drawn, and at comparative information on the funding of roads and the taxes that are appropriate to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to a matter that I started to touch on before. We have a very interesting paradox at the moment, particularly on the other side of the House and particularly with members of the National Party. Being one of the Victorian country members of the Government, I run across a lot of my National Party colleagues and hear what they have to say. They continually wander around rural Australia calling for more road funds. At the same time, they tell people that in the Fightback package they are going to scrap petrol taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something is a bit amiss here because nobody ever seems to ask the question, `If we do not have a petrol tax, who will pay for the roads?'. If anyone is asked that question what is quietly said as an afterthought to someone on the side of the hall is, `Oh, well, there will be a road user charge'. When asked, `How much?', the answer is, `We do not know. We will have to wait until we get into government to sort it out'. As the honourable member for Lyne has said tonight, a road user charge will really in effect be a toll on private roads and will replace petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to have the pleasure last Wednesday of addressing a local government forum in Melbourne with the Opposition spokesman on local government. I made the point then that, particularly in respect of local government, what is being talked about here is fraudulent. I just do not know any other way to describe it when those opposite are saying to bodies such as councils, `We are going to maintain your road funding but you will benefit from a drop in petrol taxes'. The road user charge will make up for petrol taxes and therefore the claim to the Australian motorist and the Australian transport operator that they are going to get all this relief from fuel tax when, on the other hand, they will have to pay a road user charge, is fraudulent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Double registration is another issue. If the Commission is to raise its revenue by registration charges and a levy through the bowser&mdash;that tends to be the formula agreed on by both sides of the House&mdash;one must replace the other. If that is not planned to be the case, where do the councils sit? They can either not maintain their local roads or lift their rates. Either way, a promise of lower petrol costs to the consumer in Australia is just fraudulent; I do not know any other way to describe it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the expanded brief for the Commission. It is also planned to ask the Commission to look at the efficiency of road construction and maintenance. At the moment an inquiry is being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, chaired by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). He will be bringing down a report on that fairly soon. He and his Committee are widely respected throughout the road construction industry, and I know that there has been some very interesting input to that inquiry. He will be highlighting a number of areas where efficiencies can be obtained in the standards and materials that we use and the way in which we construct roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I think we spend too much on roads in Australia; we just do not spend it very well. The Minister at the table has been a real pioneer, along with the honourable member for Shortland, the former Minister, in dragging us back to a much more sensible road construction program based around a national highway structure, a State highway structure and a local road structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very apt that the NRTC is being given a brief to look not only at the management and operation of the heavy vehicles and the light vehicle fleet in Australia and at fair ways of having road users pay their way but also at what it is that they are paying their way for. Of course, that is the road system and the enormous amounts&mdash;the billions of dollars of funding per year&mdash;that go into constructing and maintaining that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also very interesting that we are giving the Commission a brief to look at the use of alternative fuels. One emerging alternative fuel in Australia is LPG. I understand that about 10 per cent of vehicles in Melbourne and Sydney now use LPG. It is very interesting that the Opposition plans this 15 per cent consumption tax. All I can say about it is that LPG and GST do not mix. Any number of operators&mdash;in particular taxis and those commercial operators who have made very finely tuned commercial decisions to install LPG equipment in their vehicles based on the difference in price between LPG and ordinary petrol&mdash;will find under the Opposition's plan that a 15 per cent consumption tax added on to LPG will make it more expensive than it is now because there is basically no excise on LPG at the moment. If at the same time the excise is removed from petrol, that would reduce the price of petrol. So all those people who have made a conscious commercial decision to pay the $1,500 to convert their vehicle to LPG will all of a sudden realise that LPG and GST just do not mix. That is something that needs to be spelt out. Perhaps the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) or the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who are to follow in the debate, will give us some more detail on this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination of alternative fuels is an important task for the NRTC to undertake. If we just take the LPG example in the balance of payments equation, again the policy of those opposite is a paradox of stupidity because we are self-reliant in LPG. We produce our own; we do not import it. We are not self-reliant in petrol; we import petrol. So it is in Australia's interests, in the interests of the balance of payments, that we encourage more motorists to shift to LPG so that we will use fewer imports and more of our own domestic fuel supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, again, an increase in the price of one and a reduction in the price of another is a disincentive to the exact trade equation that we are trying to work out. I do not think that a lot of this has been very well thought out as the whole 600 pages was baked together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission has a real role. I am not saying that it should look at LPG first up as an issue. It has to look at the range of alternative fuels available to give us efficiency and economy, but also bearing in mind the balance of payments equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not by any means least is the expansion of the brief to assemble and publish information on road safety. Again, this goes across a whole range of issues. I had the pleasure of representing the Minister a couple of weeks ago in Brisbane to launch the new program to train the trainer in the field of motorcycle safety. Having a son who had an accident on a motorcycle simply because the driver of the car did not see him, I am in the same position as any other parent who worries about members of the family who ride a motorcycle, knowing that drivers do not see motorcyclists. So any kind of safety movement such as this not only has to happen but has to happen progressively. It is very important that the Commission, which will be closest to the road use structure in Australia in the future, I guess, should have a brief to assemble and publish information on road safety and give advice to governments on where they should be taking these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister well knows, the motorcyclists are still very sensitive about the `lights on' issue. But, as I said to that group, it is not very long ago that everybody was protesting zero alcohol levels for probationary drivers and legislation for 0.05 alcohol levels; people were refusing to wear seat belts 20 years ago; and people were refusing to wear helmets on motorcycles. When the Minister took the black spots program to the States and said, `Well, here is the money provided you come to the party on some of these things', it was a bold plan and it got results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a dramatic fall in the road toll in Australia. I do not know whether it is due to the 0.05 legislation, whether it is 0.00 or whether it is black spots; it is obviously a combination of all these things. Just as the motorcyclists have to be prepared to give `lights on' a go because it just may help a few motorists to see them, we all have to move with these things and realise that the Commission, as it is assembling this information, may become our prime source of progressive thinking in future road safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone on a little longer than I intended to and I apologise to the House for that. I thank the Opposition for its support of these amendments, although I know we really have no debate on the process. I thank the honourable member for Lyne for spelling out with a little more clarity what we are talking about in the issue of road user charges. I suspect it is going to be a topic on everyone's lips around Australia between now and the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, I publicly commend the Minister for the work he has done. I certainly wish Chairman Gordon Amadee and Chief Executive Neil Aplin further good wishes and good work with the National Road Transport Commission. I would like to take a few seconds to pay credit to the chairman of our land transport working group, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), and other members of the group including the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is seated here in the chamber tonight, for the work they have done in that land transport group working through this legislation with the Minister, his staff and the various interest groups. I think this amendment is good legislation. It represents the result of good cooperative work on everybody's part. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Very briefly, I would like to thank the four honourable members who have spoken on this National Road Transport Commission Amendment Bill 1992: the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), the Opposition spokesman on land transport; the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis); the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe); and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to the note upon which the honourable member for Burke finished. He said that this is good legislation. Yes, it is.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Burke was also gracious enough to refer to the work that had been done by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and the working group within his broader committee of the Government. The honourable member for Burke is the chairman of the Government's transport and communications committee and, as he has indicated, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is the chairman of a working group within that. Had it not been for people such as the honourable member for Burke, the honourable member for Throsby, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and their colleagues on that committee being so supportive and so cooperative in encouraging and facilitating all of the changes that we attempted to introduce into the area of land transport&mdash;we are particularly concerned with road transport but it also relates to rail transport&mdash;those very significant improvements that have been brought about would not have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the honourable member for Wannon in speaking for the Opposition may have misunderstood some elements of this total program, but misleading the House is a very serious matter. I would hope that those examples of claims, accusations, charges and so on that were presented by the honourable member for Wannon, to the extent that in some cases they were deficient, may have been a matter of genuine misunderstanding rather than deliberate misrepresentation. The claims made by the honourable member for Wannon can be judged by those people who are familiar with the industry and concerned about the background to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Burke also made mention of the National Road Transport Commission, the importance that that Commission assumes as far as all of these reforms are concerned, and the work being done by Gordon Amadee, Neil Aplin and their colleagues on the Commission. The final responsibility for recommendations which are made by the Commission rests with the Ministerial Council for endorsement. I was interested to hear one comment by the honourable member for Wannon which implied some type of intention on the part of the Opposition, if it ever becomes the Government, to introduce unilateral changes in the way in which the National Road Transport Commission operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that is just not possible unless the Opposition repudiates the agreements that have been reached with the States. If the Opposition is going to do that, it should make it clear because the States would be also interested in knowing what the Opposition's intentions are in that regard. Those opposite simply cannot do it either within the terms of the agreement with the States or in the terms of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point about this amendment Bill is that it applies the regulatory arrangements of the National Road Transport Commission to light vehicles. Unlike the heavy vehicles, those over 4.5 tonnes, light vehicles will not be subject to uniform charging arrangements. This Bill is simply designed to extend the regulatory arrangements to them. I do not want to say too much about some of these other issues, but they were raised and it is important that they at least be addressed in part. The Opposition has made the claim that, under Fightback and the GST arrangements associated with it, it has some intention of reducing or eliminating fuel excise. However, the industry knows and all road users know&mdash;as the honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Throsby both clearly indicated&mdash;that that revenue would need to be raised in some other form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commercial road transport industry has indicated that it does not want undue emphasis placed on road user charges based on mass and distance. This is precisely what the Opposition has indicated it will do. The industry itself has indicated that it prefers to pay at the bowser. That is precisely the approach which has been adopted by this Government. In order to compensate for that reduced fuel excise, it has been indicated by the honourable member for Throsby that the registration charge for, say, private motorists on their own vehicles would increase by at least 100 per cent. It is more likely to be three times as great. The private motorists need to keep in mind that that is the promise made by the Opposition. That is the threat which is delivered to them by Fightback and the GST arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the commercial road transport industry is concerned, it needs to be clearly understood that, if the Opposition is going to have those road user charges, any type of rigid vehicle carrying freight on the road will be up for an annual charge of at least $7,000 to compensate; a conventional six-axle articulated vehicle would be charged about $17,000 a year; a B-double about $30,000 to $35,000 a year; and road trains in excess of $60,000 a year. That is precisely what is involved. The road transport industry knows that is the position, and the Opposition also knows that is the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have indicated that the charge will be based on mass and distance. If they are going to eliminate fuel excise, one other possibility is that it can be replaced, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has indicated it will be, by a road user charge based on mass and distance. I have indicated what the level of those charges would need to be to compensate for that reduced excise. The other alternative is that the Opposition will require the States to compensate for that reduced revenue in some way by having them increase the State based fuel franchise charge. I believe that is the approach which those opposite are more likely to adopt if they are given the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the industry knows. The industry has asked questions of those opposite to which it has not received satisfactory responses. The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Wannon, knows that the National Farmers Federation, for example, has stated very clearly that it is far from satisfied with the Opposition's position as far as road user charging is concerned. It simply has not received answers. I have said to the industry `Don't buy a pig in a poke and don't be taken for mugs', because that is precisely what the Opposition is proposing for it. The points that were made by the honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Throsby were points of substance. I thank the honourable member for Burke for representing me in Queensland; he did it admirably. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is one of an increasing amount of omnibus legislation that is now being presented, particularly in this portfolio and in the transport and communications portfolio. It would appear that we come back here time and time again to undertake these omnibus activities within this portfolio. I wonder if the Government should consider whether the time has come for a total review of all the legislation falling within this portfolio because, quite obviously, piecemeal legislation such as this does not promote good government. We believe that there should be a consistent approach to administration, and if we are back here every other week of the sitting period making these minor amendments it does not indicate that we have this good administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing terribly earth shattering in this Bill tonight. It amends five Acts and repeals two Acts. The two Acts that are to be repealed are the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests (Commission of Inquiry) Act 1987 and the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act 1976. In reality, both of these Acts have served their purpose. Their time has run out and the Government has decided to repeal them. That is one of the easier parts of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through the other five Acts individually. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act increases the value of contracts the Director of Parks and Wildlife may enter into. They rise from $100,000 to $250,000, and obviously the Opposition does not have too much trouble with this. It is consistent with the increases that have already been approved by a number of other authorities. There is virtually a one-word amendment to the Australian Heritage Commission Act. It corrects a small drafting error, and we have no problems with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting one, however, is the Australia Council Act. The amendments enable the Minister, rather than the Governor-General, to appoint members of that Council. We think this is quite interesting because a number of other bodies which have boards appointed by the Governor-General fall within this portfolio. They include the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Heritage Commission, the Australian National Maritime Museum, the Museum of Australia, the Australian National Gallery, the Australian National Library, and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. We really wonder what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Admittedly, the chairman would still be appointed by the Governor-General, but the proposed new section in the Bill&mdash;31A&mdash;allows the Minister to delegate in writing to the Council the power to appoint members, but not the chairman, of the various boards. I suppose an example could be the Aboriginal Arts Board. As I said, the appointments are now made by the Minister in reality, but this amendment gives greater power to the Minister and I think creates the possibility of political pressure on the Council. We do not think the Government should allow appointments of members of the various boards to be made by the Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Arts Council, we have already been through the situation in Queensland where week after week in the local newspapers there have been accusations of favouritism in the allocation of grants by the Council through its various boards. Mr Sweeney, who is the representative of the Arts Council in Queensland, is quite vocal about this, and I think he has presented some rather good information about how Queensland has missed out in the allocation of some of these funds. As the years go by, so Mr Sweeney's vehemence increases as he makes what I think are very valid points about the imbalance of the activities of the Australia Council in terms of those Queensland grants. I think the only thing this piece of legislation will do is give further weight to those claims. There will be more about this in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I think is quite interesting concerns the amendments to the National Gallery Act. These amendments change the name of the gallery from the Australian National Gallery to the National Gallery of Australia. One really wonders why this is necessary and why so much expense should be gone to to make this possible. The Government says that this change is in line with other institutions, such as the National Library of Australia and the National Museum of Australia. The other thing that is quite interesting is that we have just established the Australian National Maritime Museum, which runs completely counter to this argument. There is no doubt that there is some potential to create confusion with other institutions, such as the National Gallery of Victoria. The old name&mdash;the Australian National Gallery&mdash;was very much a statement; there was no confusion there. I really wonder what the purpose of this change is because there is no doubt that the gallery is known throughout the world by its present title. There should not be a need for that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the change will not make the gallery more efficient, and I would not think it would have the capacity to attract any more visitors than it does now. My mind boggles at the amount of letterheads, envelopes and every thing else in the administration of the Australian National Gallery that will have to be changed and the unbelievable expense that will be involved with this minor amendment. Obviously, the Opposition is not terribly impressed with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final reference I would like to make tonight is to the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act. The amendment enables the National Capital Planning Authority, with the approval of the Minister, to manage national land which is used, or is to be used, for the special purposes of Canberra as the national capital. This legislation formalises the arrangement which was made on 1 July handing over most of the national land from the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to the NCPA. The Department of Administrative Services retains control over some of the land, but the Minister is granted no new powers under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite interesting because the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has put forward for consideration by the Joint Committee on the National Capital a proposal to nominate Canberra for World Heritage listing. If the city, or parts of it, are declared national land the position of the ACT Government in deciding whether or not to proceed to Heritage listing may be weakened. While we would not oppose this piece of legislation, I think it is only right that we highlight the concern over the power which is entrusted to the Minister in light of the possible World Heritage listing of Australia's national capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those brief comments, I reiterate what I said at the beginning of my contribution tonight: this is one of a number of omnibus Bills which seem to be coming in week after week from this portfolio area. I repeat the Opposition's request that we should look to a major review of the legislation within that portfolio to see whether we can sort it out once and for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating some minor amendments to a Bill that relates to the portfolio of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. A number of those areas relate specifically to the environment, particularly national parks and wildlife conservation and the Australian Heritage Commission. This Bill is a good time to review some of the achievements of the Government in environmental protection because it enables us to range widely within the portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I look back to 1990, the Government has had a stunning set of achievements with respect to what it has been able to do in the protection of the environment. I will run through some of those achievements. For instance, the Government has nominated Fraser Island, the sub-Antarctic islands, Macquarie Island, and stage three of Kakadu for World Heritage listing. We have established the ecologically sustainable development process. We have set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We have established the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. We have moved to introduce endangered species legislation and establish a national biodiversity strategy. We have tackled urban environment issues such as air and water quality, cleaning up beaches and waste minimisation. We have simplified the environmental impact assessment process by minimising duplication between governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to contrast those sorts of achievements with those of the coalition whose environmental credentials are rather poor. It has opposed the nomination of many World Heritage areas. World Heritage listing is perhaps the most significant manner by which a country can foreshadow to the world that it has areas which must be kept, held and managed properly for all time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a world leader in implementing the World Heritage Convention. In fact, we have nine properties on that World Heritage List. They are: Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef, the Willandra Lakes region of western New South Wales, the Lord Howe Island group, the western Tasmanian wilderness national parks, the Australian east coast temperate and subtropical rainforest parks, Uluru National Park&mdash;which encompasses Ayers Rock and Mount Olga&mdash;the wet tropics of Queensland and Shark Bay in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view on these matters is that the Commonwealth needs to accept and has accepted, in our case, the ultimate responsibility for World Heritage. In discharging that responsibility we have sought to ensure, as far as possible, that no-one should be worse off as a result of the protection of the environment. One will have seen, as each issue arose and we listed each area, that we have a good record of providing assistance to communities as part of those decisions. Protecting the jobs in local communities affected by environmental decisions is not only fair but essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What bothers the Government is that the coalition in government would allow the State governments to hold the power of veto over World Heritage matters. Australia's international obligations would therefore be abrogated whenever a State government opposed the protection of a place that is of international heritage significance. That would inevitably lead to international embarrassment for Australia and the destruction of environmental assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at issues such as the management of Kakadu and Uluru, we will find that this Government has been committed to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service managing the Kakadu and Uluru World Heritage areas. These areas are acknowledged by international conservation bodies, such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, to be currently managed at the highest standards with the full support and encouragement of the local Aboriginal people. By contrast, the coalition, we know, is committed to handing over Kakadu and Uluru national parks to the Northern Territory Government to circumvent legislation which does not allow activity that would damage the ecology of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take one area off the coast of Queensland. We have agreed with the recommendations of the Tony Fitzgerald inquiry into Fraser Island and have nominated the island for World Heritage listing this year. We and the Queensland Government have put together a $16 1/2m adjustment package to make sure that those local communities on Fraser Island and on the mainland can develop new job creating industries in the area. The same week as we were celebrating the news that the World Heritage Bureau had recommended Fraser Island for World Heritage listing, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that a coalition government would consider allowing sand mining to resume on Fraser Island. Not even Malcolm Fraser, as a former coalition Prime Minister, would allow that. An Opposition spokesman&mdash;a National Party member, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott)&mdash;said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fraser Island and Kakadu are good examples of how mining can be carried out without harm to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Fortunately, Dr Hewson has now backed down on this issue. But it does show a lack of knowledge and commitment of the coalition to environmental issues. In south-western Tasmania the Government has protected the Franklin River and over 100,000 hectares of Tasmania's eucalypt forests. By contrast, the coalition opposed in 1983 the protection of the Franklin River and eucalypt forests and would allow mineral exploration and mining in the forests of south-western Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad question of the balance between environment and development is always a difficult one to answer. We have worked hard and are determined to achieve what we call ecologically sustainable development to ensure that the environment and development are balanced. We recognise that Australia needs development, but we also need to take care of our natural environment to ensure sustainable growth for the future. As part of that process, we have established the ecologically sustainable development process to integrate environmental concerns with environmental growth. We also have in place a comprehensive set of procedures which ensure that when a proposed resource development program is examined it is done so expeditiously and with the correct integration of economic, environmental, Aboriginal, social and other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition perpetuates the myth of black and green tape, as the Leader of the Opposition calls it. It does that because it does not understand the requirements of the integration of environment and development. The Leader of the Opposition plans to fix a time limit on development approvals for major projects. In an address to the Liberal Party convention on 5 July this year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government hasn't got its act together and hasn't gone through the environmental and Aboriginal heritage impact studies and so on, well, the project can go ahead anyway. It's the only way. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he would set up a process which he would abandon despite the fact that all of the correct and necessary information would not have been made available by the various players. It is part of the myth that is peddled by the coalition that the Government has held up many projects, such as the Marandoo iron ore project in Western Australia. Since the Commonwealth lifted export controls on iron ore, as it announced in the One Nation statement, the Commonwealth has no formal involvement in this process whatsoever. The question of forests has provided a fair amount of conflict in the environmental arena. We need to keep in mind that since European settlement Australia has lost nearly half of its forests and about three-quarters of its rainforests. We have done a great deal about that while we have been in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nearly one million hectares of tropical rainforests were protected through the Queensland wet tropics World Heritage listing. As I mentioned, in Tasmania over 100,000 hectares of tall eucalypt forests are now secure in a World Heritage area. Both of those listings were vehemently opposed by coalition governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some exciting news in Western Australia is that a substantial area of forest will now be conserved under the Australian Heritage Commission and the Department of Conservation and Land Management agreement. The recently released draft national forest policy statement includes a Government commitment to protect the best of our old growth and wilderness forests by 1995. Further, on the question of forest conservation and the development process, or what became known as resource security, I can inform the House that the Government is committed to ensuring adequate conservation and protection of our native forests while concurrently encouraging a thriving forest products industry and providing more and better jobs for Australians associated with that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that our Forest Conservation and Development Bill would have achieved this objective and facilitated substantial investment in plantations in Australia. Unfortunately, that legislation was defeated by the coalition in the Senate and with it the prospect of balance and the thousands of jobs and significant plantations that it would have brought to the industry. The coalition recently introduced its own resource security Bill into the Parliament. Unlike the Government's Bill, the Opposition is prepared to allow industry to have almost unfettered access to Australia's native forests without the commitment to jobs, to investment and, importantly, to the appropriate safeguards to cater for rare or threatened species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern to us was that community groups were sufficiently well endowed to enable us to have a proper degree of debate and consultation about conservation. People need to realise that it takes time, resources and dedication for community groups to organise responses to various development proposals. While community groups have the dedication to do that, it has been our view that policy should provide resources and time. Under the grants to voluntary conservation organisations scheme, the Federal Government has provided just over $1m for administrative funding to conservation groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the limited financial resources of most of those organisations, that funding has been very important to make sure that the Commonwealth could rely on the information or the views that were fed to it by conservation groups. That addresses the relative power of communities against development interests so that we could strike the right balance between those various interests. Under the coalition's proposals in Fightback, those grants would cease. That would include all voluntary conservation organisations. It is already the coalition policy, as has been stated, to withdraw funding from the Australian Conservation Foundation under the GVCO scheme I mentioned before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that proper time for debate and discussion and assembling arguments be made available. Fightback proposes to impose a 12-month decision making time frame for project approvals, which will make it pretty hard for community groups to respond properly and intelligently to development proposals. One of our more recent schemes is the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. Our decision to create the Commonwealth EPA reflects our need to concentrate on and protect the urban environment, which</PARA>
<PARA>means our air, water, land and ocean systems. Alternatively, Fightback demonstrates that the Opposition understands neither the structure of the Commonwealth EPA nor the significance of the work it undertakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition proposes to halve the budget of this brand new Environment Protection Agency, which means that the Commonwealth would no longer be able to maintain a meaningful role in environment protection and the States would once again assume the major responsibility. It seems to me that without the Commonwealth taking a leading role, there would be no national environmental quality standards and the reforms aimed at developing a uniform national system of environmental assessment would surely falter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Heritage Commission was established in Whitlam's time, in 1975. The Commission is now working closely with State governments to undertake what we call regional assessments of National Estate values. I used the example before of the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management, in which regional assessments had been used to overcome land use conflicts. The coalition wants to wield the knife here and has stated that it will place an immediate freeze on the entry of places with National Estate values onto the register until there has been a complete review and a culling of some of the places on the register. To me that shows a lack of understanding of the Australian Heritage Commission and the role of the National Estate in protecting Australia's heritage. The coalition has vowed to cut $1m from the Australian Heritage Commission budget, which would make it very difficult&mdash;probably in the end impossible&mdash;to continue this work on regional assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's desire to introduce a goods and services tax will also impact on the environment. As the world works towards lowering its dependence on fossil fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Opposition plans to move in exactly the opposite direction. A leading Australian conservation organisation has estimated that the coalition's policy would increase petrol consumption by between 13 and 24 per cent, thereby increasing air pollution and total greenhouse gas emissions by between 2 and 4 per cent, not to mention the effect of increased oil imports on Australia's trade balance. Alternative fuels are a worry. LPG and natural gas have a much lower carbon content than petrol and oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Opposition's policy regarding the Bureau of Meteorology. What is essential is that we have good information so that we can make judgments about the management of the portfolio, but particularly the environment. The Opposition has vowed to cut $10m from the Bureau of Meteorology. The savings would be made in the administration of the Bureau of Meteorology, making up moneys by charging the public for meteorological information on a fee for service basis, which means that access to weather information would become somewhat more scarce and expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve those savings, we understand from the Bureau that we would have to consider closing the following: Willis Island, which provides for cyclone early warning; provincial weather services across Australia in places such as Alice Springs, Port Hedland, Rockhampton, Launceston and Cairns; upper air stations at Giles and Longreach; and the national cooperative observer network. The potential dangers in the Leader of the Opposition's cost slashing exercise include a reduction in the quality of forecasts, which would jeopardise cyclone and other weather warnings. The implications for industries including farming, tourism, fishing, and air and sea services are serious. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me some breadth in the discussion of these matters under the portfolio Bill. </PARA>

We in this place, in a very united manner, tried to send a message to Treasury and the Reserve Bank that we did not like the idea of taking Caroline Chisholm off the note.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr. Charles,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the introduction of the Plastic $5 Note, the members of the Berwick Village Chamber of Commerce have raised continuing concerns in regard to the design of this denomination of the currency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues relate to the problems associated with the handling of the plastic note.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The notes stick together, and require more than reasonable care to ensure that only one note is offered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The tendency of the notes to stick together, is also a problem when the notes are being counted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. After having been folded, handling of the note becomes almost impossible, because the fold or crease, becomes an almost permanent crease, which does not allow the note to be flattened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Whilst there is a significant amount of defacing, this may only be a novelty which may cease after a while. In the meantime, defacing is high.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. When put next to a Plastic $10 note, the two notes are easily mistaken one for the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These concerns have been raised by a number of retailers, who have also reported that their customers have been continuous in their criticism of the plastic composition of the note.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has also been reported to us, that the management and staff of the Banks are not happy with the Plastic $5 Note for the same reasons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I was very pleased to receive a publication from the Pork Council of Australia, `Industry Brief No 12' dated 8 October 1992. I was very pleased to read what the Pork Council had to say. The important part is on page 3, under the heading `Other Industry News'. Under the subheading `Goods and Services Tax', the Pork Council says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the assistance of the National Farmers Federation, the Pork Council of Australia has obtained a copy of the computer program developed by ACIL Consultants for evaluating the impact of the Coalition's proposed goods and services tax (GST). The forecasts that this program generated for some other farming enterprises were included in Industry Brief No. 7. However, with the program itself now available, it is possible to look more closely at the likely impact on pig raising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The analysis indicates that Australian pig producers may be net losers from the introduction of a GST.</PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results do show that the cost of production will be cut by about 1 to 1.3% in most cases. The biggest savings will come to those producers who must pay relatively more for transport of feed in and pigs out. Those piggeries that are large enough to incur payroll tax will also benefit by about another 0.6% when this is removed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Pork Council goes on to say this, which is important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, offsetting these gains are three other factors: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Pig producers will pay GST, at an estimated average rate of 4.8%, on their personal expenditure. This may not be fully offset by income tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. More importantly, from a total industry perspective, relative pig prices are likely to fall. This is because pigmeat, being relatively free of taxes at present&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will probably rise by more than some other expenditure items at the point of retail sale when GST is introduced. Because pigmeat supply is inelastic, the price back to producers will fall as a result. It is impossible at this stage to predict what the effect on prices will be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. There will also be increased costs, either as accountancy services or in the producer's own time, to meet the documentation requirements for the new tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums up very clearly that the tax will have a massive effect on the pig industry. It is important to note that the pig meat industry at the present time&mdash;I hope in the future it becomes an export orientated industry&mdash;is basically a domestic industry. As such, all pig meat will be taxed at 15 per cent. That means that if a family is going to spend $100 on pig meat over a month or two weeks or whatever, 85 per cent of that will go in buying the product and the other 15 per cent will be in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important aspect that is often forgotten in regard to Fightback is the effect of industrial relations. The Opposition has indicated that it will destroy the award system we have, and workers' wages will go down. Working families will therefore have less money to spend on food and clothes, which will be taxed at 15 per cent. That means a massive reduction in the purchasing power and capacity of working families to buy the essential foods and ingredients of life. That will impact directly on the pig meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take this even further, the ACIL report indicated how farmers would be better off. I have said this many times in the House before and I will continue to say it. An analysis of four farm incomes ranging from $55,000 to $71,000 net free of debt indicated that, as a consequence, farmers would be better off. But the fact is that the majority of farmers do not earn that sort of money. In fact, yesterday the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> said that farmers were on the brink of ruin in Queensland and that more than 7,000 of Queensland's 25,000 farmers are in danger of going broke. If that is the case&mdash;and I believe it is, because of drought and commodity price drops&mdash;it is a joke to assume that the ACIL report and the NFF analysis are correct. It is a total mockery when we have the hillbillies of the National Party, and in particular the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), talking about a crisis, then wanting to put a tax of 15 per cent on the farmers they say are going broke, but adopting the ACIL report, which talks about net incomes of between $55,000 and $71,000 net free of debt as the basis for the analysis that Fightback will be beneficial to farmers. The fact is that it will not be. The pig industry knows it, and the Pork Council of Australia has said so in its publication. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Mr Jeff Kennett and his team staged a magnificent victory in Victoria, and Victoria has been restored to its rightful place as the jewel in the crown of the Liberal Party. Honourable members will be aware that the coalition gained a 6 per cent swing throughout Victoria, resulting in a majority of up to 38 seats. It will be the largest government majority since 1907.

In the seat of Sandringham, Murray Thompson recorded an outstanding swing of 15.2 per cent to retain the seat for the Liberal party, and Chris Strong had an excellent win in Higinbotham province.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the grievance debate I was talking about the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I got to his second point before I was rudely interrupted by the efflux of time. His second principle was that of multicultural harmony, whereby we would receive people from other countries in proportion to the numbers of people from those countries already in Australia. He went on to say that this would benefit such people as the Italians and the Dutch. Of course, he did not mention the Greeks, but the clear purpose of this concept is to give weight and preference to the people of his own ethnic background, in spite of the fact that they do not want to come here anyway. In other words, he is displaying a clear racial preference in immigration. It may be one based on delusion, but it is still a clear preference. Why is he not attacked by the media? It is because he is just acting, as all the professional ethnics do. They have the licence to do so. They want more people like themselves. That is the bottom line. They support multiculturalism because it furthers their objectives and gives them more power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calwell attacked me for saying that the White Australia policy was the correct policy to adopt at Federation and that only after the end of World War II was it sensible to review it; yet his proposed policy is based on quotas as the population stood while the White Australia policy was still well and truly in operation. He says that the quota system is how things work in the US. In fact, while the US still has a quota system of a sort, his proposal harks back to the earlier US system which was scrapped in 1965 because it was considered racist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider it. Between 1917 and 1925 the US passed a series of restrictive immigration Bills based on the concept of national origins; that is, the intake was designed, in its national composition, to mirror the ethnic composition of the US at certain dates&mdash;a major plank of the proposal of the honourable member for Calwell. This looked and sounded much better than the White Australia policy, but in practice it was much more restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great irony is that this system, which the honourable member for Calwell now embraces, was specifically designed to exclude southern Europeans from the United States. Also ironically, a number of southern Europeans, who had wanted to go to the United States and found themselves blocked, were unable to migrate and came to Australia instead. The honourable member for Calwell now turns this system on its head and uses it to favour southern Europeans. This is an absolute joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not make the quotas relate to the population as it stood at Federation in 1901? This is an equally sensible date. We had the White Australia policy then as well. Clearly, that would not meet the objective of the honourable member for Calwell. We know what that objective is; I have made that quite clear. It has been the opportunists and frauds who have manipulated and distorted our immigration program in recent times, with the assistance of cowardly politicians and members of the trendy new class more concerned with their own status and power than their much vaunted equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My position is this: mass immigration is a concept whose time has passed. The great majority of Australians, migrants and non-migrants, do not benefit from it or support it. Immigration should be cut to 50,000 and held at or below that figure for a long term. We must scrap the policy of multiculturalism, which is a corrupt game of patronage that is costing the Australian public dearly both financially and socially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have strongly attacked those professional ethnics, I do not believe that they represent the people whom they claim to represent. I believe that the vast majority of migrants, of whatever background, support me in wanting what is best for this country and our children. Southern Europeans have made a proud contribution to this country, and I ask them and all other migrants to disown and reject those professional ethnics who falsely claim to represent them. We are all Australians and we cannot create a better world for our children if our country is divided, as the experience in Europe so clearly shows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude, however, without making a few remarks towards the god-daddy of them all, the original professional ethnic&mdash;the honoured Al Grassby, society's friend. I see that the taxpayers of Australia, through the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, have been ordered to pay him $180,000 towards his court costs for his conspiracy to pervert the course of justice charge, which has just been dismissed. I note that he intends to return to the immigration field, in his, to use his words, `proper capacity as a consultant in relation to immigration and related matters, which is my field of expertise'. All I have to say about him is that one day his true record as Immigration Minister will be exposed to the full light of day. It may be long after we have all passed away, but it will eventually happen because, as Mr Grassby knows, no-one can defame the dead. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back in May 1988 the tax file numbering system was introduced into Australia. I want to remind the House that the then Treasurer said at that time that `the tax file number will not establish a citizen identification system'. In August 1990 there was an extension of the use of the tax file number. It now applies to every person who is a client of any major agency and it is, therefore, a general purpose citizen identification system. He also said that the tax file numbering system will be administered exclusively by the Taxation Office for tax purposes. In August 1990 it was extended to apply to many other purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Australian Taxation Office is now proposing to extend the tax file numbering system to students in year 10. At the moment, a pilot study is being undertaken in Tasmania to encourage students in year 10 to apply for a tax file number&mdash;not students who have employment and are earning a wage. The basis for doing this is that it is believed that it will improve the integrity of the taxation file numbering system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we really think about it, if it is going to be voluntary, we will find that only 4 or 5 per cent, maybe 10 per cent, of Australians will apply. Hopefully none of them will take up this option. I believe that it is only a blind by the Australian Taxation Office to extend the identification system far beyond what was intended. The Australian people back in 1987-88 had a vigorous debate as to whether we should have an Australia card, and clearly rejected that option. Here we find a very powerful government agency trying to use the educational system in Australia to get young people to voluntarily become part of the tax file numbering system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that questions need to be asked as to what the purpose for this really is. Has this been authorised by the Government, or is it just the arrogance of one of our departments going ahead and extending an identification system far beyond what many Australians would regard as acceptable? I think that this just further illustrates the fact that the Australia card concept is now becoming a reality in Australia by default. I believe that, as Australians, we should be questioning the Australian Taxation Office as to whether this is fit and proper. I believe that, in this day and age, teachers are under considerable pressure to carry out the basics of education and teaching, let alone to become a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. Therefore, I say to the teachers out there that they ought not to have anything to do with this, that they ought to reject the concept of trialing such a system in Tasmania. Hopefully it will not see the light of day anywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office is wanting to encourage schools by paying them $5 for every child who is prepared to apply for a tax file numbering system. Clearly this is purely a bribe to get schools involved to become a branch office of the Australian Taxation Office. I think that we ought to be aware of these types of matters which the Office is trying to extend to young Australians aged 15 and 16. It is not what I believe we ought to be doing in this country. I hope that this extension of the long arm of the Taxation Office can be cut off and the Big Brother state can be prevented in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I moved a private member's business motion that this House support a positive investment climate for the South Australian automotive industry. I pointed out that the Opposition's zero tariff proposal for the year 2000 would devastate that industry by allowing cheap imports. Yesterday the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> carried an article by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who sought to repudiate this position. There are a number of differences between us. First, there is no motor car industry in the world that does not receive government assistance. Japan's industry receives the least, but while it was being built it was most heavily protected. Similarly, Australia's industry only came into existence due to a protected domestic market. Removing that protection involves dangers. The honourable member for Barker accepts that if it were wrong it would be a tragedy&mdash;one, I might add, that could never be undone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, last week's report by the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impact of Tariff Cuts</EMPHASIS> must be treated with some caution. It was commissioned by the industry lobby for a known anti-tariff sector&mdash;the Australian Mining Industry Council. It makes some heroic conclusions about the car industry's growth prospects without protection, although it acknowledges that employment might shrink. But it makes no mention of South Australia's automobile industry. I repeat: it has nothing direct to say about the size, output or employment level of that industry in South Australia. It is a projection based on an economic model with no announced geographic dimension. In contrast, government policy of maintaining some tariff protection is based on careful consideration of such economic modelling by the Industry Commission and also extensive empirical investigation of the industry itself and its offshore counterparts and competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of going to 15 per cent nominal and 35 per cent effective real tariff protection by the year 2000 was advocated neither by theory nor by the industry, but by policy objectives. We seek to produce, and are already producing, cheaper, better cars, some of which are exported, and to maintain an Australian car industry much of which is in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, not all members of the Opposition support the zero tariff option. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) has circulated in his electorate a copy of his speech on the car industry in this House on 10 September. This carefully crafted document argues that the South Australian car industry is non-negotiable. He cautions against accepting economic forecasts for more than 12 months into the future and says he will not stand on the tarmac and wave goodbye to that industry. He, like the State Leader of the Liberal Party, Dean Brown, is not happy with the zero tariff policy. Nor am I. No Opposition politician standing for an Adelaide seat at the next election spoke in that private member's debate. The anger in Adelaide against zero tariffs is sufficient for them to want to maintain a distance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been possible to get support for zero tariffs from some Australians, notably those in regions or sectors of the economy which do not seem to benefit directly from Government industry protection and promotion policies. But if Australia wants to become a modern economy, with a range of production and technology and a diverse body of exports including elaborately transformed manufactures, it can no more rely wholly on the free market than its equivalents in Europe, North America and Japan. Australia needs an active industry policy from Government, and South Australia's car industry will be wiped out without one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the point that I made last week. It is a point that has often been stated by the South Australian car industry, and I am pleased to note it was repeated again today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at Question Time, but it is a point that is ignored by the Monash study and the Opposition front bench. It is this: if the marginal unit cost of production in a 400,000 run in Japan, plus the $500 unit transport cost to Australia, is less than the marginal unit cost of production on an Australian production run, why, given zero tariffs, would a multinational car firm produce any in South Australia?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been various changes to the treatment of Friendly Society Bonds over time, but basically bonuses on Friendly Society Bonds in respect of the period before 1 November 1983 are not taken into account under the income test.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask that the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) look at this question. It appears to me that the large number of people who took out friendly society bonds in 1982 are being wrongly treated.

I believe they are being prejudiced, and it is a matter which should be addressed. </PARA>
