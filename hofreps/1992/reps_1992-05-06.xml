<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment has been made by the Senate to the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 to put in place a statutory scheme for a review of the main amendments that are made by the Bill, those amendments being made to narrow the scope of derivative use immunity in relation to civil proceedings or prosecutions for criminal offences. When this matter was before the House, the Opposition opposed those amendments. We do not consider that they are warranted, and we put that case fully and well. The Australian Democrats obviously had misgivings as well, as they have put forward a scheme for a statutory review. Because it reviews what we consider was a bad proposal in the first place, we will support the amendment. But I must say in passing that the scheme for the review looks clumsy and looks as though it will not necessarily achieve the best review of this particular provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be very difficult for somebody to go through the way in which the provisions have helped the enforcement of national scheme laws. One simply will not know whether it was this particular change that led to a charge in one particular case, a prosecution in one particular case or a conviction in one particular case that would not otherwise have transpired. One simply will not know whether this particular change led to an infringement of civil liberties in a particular case without perusing each and every case and each and every factual circumstance and interviewing every person who has been charged and bringing him in. It is going to be very difficult to review, and it is going to be very difficult to gather the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the report is to be made will not necessarily allay the qualms that we had in the first place and that led us to oppose the legislation. We still think it was bad legislation. Reviewing it after the event does nothing to allay those fears and qualms. But because it is a review of bad legislation, we will support the amendment that is now before the Chair. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not get its legislation right here, and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) should lift his game. The present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when Treasurer, made it quite clear that he had no interest in the mechanics of the various taxation Acts. He made no pretence of being interested. That seems to be the style of the present Treasurer, because he does not deign to seek carriage of his own legislation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without inflicting unfair criticism on those people the Treasurer delegates to do the job in this place, in my experience, those delegates do not understand the legislation. When we first debate the measures in the House, the Minister representing the Treasurer in the debate merely parrots the views of tax officials in the advisers box, or ignores the criticisms and proposals of the Opposition. Our criticisms and proposals, as evidenced by these amendments, are meant to make the legislation work. They were not, when first discussed in this place and subsequently in the Senate,  part of a political point-scoring game.  We  merely  wanted the legislation  to  achieve what the Government said it wanted  to achieve,  yet  it  had  to  go  to  the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the role that the Senate as a House of review performs. In this context it is entirely due to my colleague Senator John Watson that we have 17 amendments back here which are intended to, always were intended to, and will, make the legislation work. In other words, through the agency of Senator Watson we are making good legislation out of bad for the Government. That would be all right if we got credit for it. That opportunity should also be given here. Senator Watson is virtually a one man committee on taxation in the Senate. On this occasion, if not for the first time then certainly better than before, he appreciates the detailed responses he got to his detailed questions in connection with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging to see that the Australian Taxation Office is taking the concerns of the Opposition seriously, even if the Government and its Ministers are not. I join Senator Watson in expressing appreciation for the work of the Tax Office advisers who have assisted in getting this legislation into some sort of workable shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing to note is that, by having this legislation referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the clarifications given by the Tax Office have some force which would otherwise not be the case. As far as they are recorded in the proceedings of those meetings, they become binding administratively on the Taxation Office in accordance with the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act. That will add to the value of the work of Senator Watson as well as making the compliance with tax legislation by practising professionals in the tax field and businesses that much easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of this legislation and these amendments deal with depreciation. I just want to make the point that the depreciation measures covered in this legislation were first announced in the March 1991 industry statement. Here we are 12 months later discussing the legislation to put the Government's announced intentions into effect. Furthermore, on the provisional <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> we had another taxation Bill to further amend depreciation allowances arising out of the `One Job' statement made earlier this year. Not only has the Government's intention stated in March last year not found legislative form, but we are already changing that before the relevant legislation goes through the Parliament. We are now in the stage of discussing further changes in depreciation. The Government's tinkering with that aspect of tax law does not bear dwelling on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the second reading debate and the committee stage, I personally canvassed very widely the serious concerns and telling criticisms of the legislation which came from the Taxation Institute of Australia. Some of that surrounded the latitude of discretion being conferred on the Commissioner of Taxation. I think that might be partially dealt with in these amendments, but the Government might have gone a good way further to simplify the Acts and the intentions of the provisions so that people might comply with them without running the risk of incurring the wrath or, more importantly, the penalties imposed by the Commissioner of Taxation for failure to comply 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that I derive great satisfaction from the fact that we are dealing with 17 amendments to the legislation, which could have been dealt with in this place, because my colleague Senator Watson, a member of the Liberal-National Party coalition, was the driving force behind them. Had he not acted as he did, I suspect&mdash;as we have seen in other cases&mdash;that the Government would have taken up to two or three years to pick up these amendments and, in the meantime, thrown tax professionals and others who have to comply with the Act into even greater confusion than has already been forced upon them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I would indicate immediately that the Liberal and National parties have no objection to the amendments that are proposed in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill is designed&mdash;may I put it this way&mdash;to render slightly less objectionable a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation which we opposed at the outset, namely, the training guarantee legislation. Because of that, it is logical that the Opposition not oppose the amending Bill that the Government is putting forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill effectively widens the eligible practices under the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act to include work experience, expenditure in relation to people on work experience, and it also effects a number of administrative improvements to that legislation. In those circumstances there is obviously no intelligent reason why the Opposition should vote against the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation relates to the broad issue of training and employment. I want to make some remarks about the training and employment situation in Australia at present, and the training and employment policies of the Government and the Opposition. Let me say at the outset that there is a good deal of agreement between the Labor Party and the Liberal and National parties on many issues related to training. There is no argument across this chamber about the need to have a competency based approach to training in this country.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no argument about the need to fully equip our work force, or young men and women leaving school and seeking to enter tertiary institutions or the labour market, with greater training skills and training opportunities. Certainly nobody in the Liberal or National parties will be heard contesting the proposition that our society owes to all young people the opportunity to receive reasonable and adequate levels of training, that it also owes to our young people a system which recognises their varying skills and capacities and the fact that not all those who leave school are suitable for training at a university, and that we should offer to young Australians a wide variety of training opportunities. I welcome a number of initiatives over the last few years that have been directed towards more closely relating our training institutions and our training capacities to the needs and the practices of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  I also welcome the growing acceptance in the broad labour movement of the need to adopt something in the nature of a training or youth wage. Some years ago whenever anybody talked about the idea of a training wage or a youth wage&mdash;although for a long time there had been youth differentials in the various awards around Australia&mdash;there was an instinctive almost knee-jerk reaction to the effect that it was yet another attempt by some dark forces in our community to drive down the living standards of young people. The fact is that excessively high youth wages have driven young people out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why over 30 per cent of our young people are out of work is that youth wages in this country are still far too high. One of the reasons why young people are denied jobs is that the basic award requirements in many areas represent impenetrable barriers of entry. When I saw the Carmichael report advancing the proposition that maybe in the future young people who were doing a training course should be paid only for the actual time that they spent on the job, I thought that represented an acceptance and very sensible recognition of an obvious fact by a man who had spent years in the labour movement and by the group of people in the committee that he led. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not subscribe to everything that was contained in the Carmichael report, I can at least say that I accepted that particular aspect of the report. I have also acknowledged on other occasions the need to examine the proposition that if, as a result of introducing something in the nature of what Mr Carmichael recommended on that subject, the pay accruing to young people was below the unemployment benefit, we ought to examine a proposition that would at least subsidise the pay up to the level of the unemployment benefit. It would be patently ridiculous to have a situation where there was a financial incentive for a young person in Australia to remain on the dole rather than to take advantage of a training opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that there are intelligent areas of bipartisanship so far as training is concerned. It ought to be, as far as possible, an area which is freed&mdash;I stress `as far as possible'&mdash;from partisanship because all of us are concerned about the daunting responsibility of providing job opportunities for young Australians, particularly against the background of a youth unemployment level which is now over 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One, of course, cannot glide over the training guarantee administration legislation without remarking that the financial and constitutional device which has been used to extract the levy on this occasion is exactly the same as the financial and constitutional device which is proposed to extract the levy in relation to superannuation. Basically, what the Government says in this legislation is the same as what it says in the superannuation guarantee legislation. It says that unless one makes the payment&mdash;or, in the case of the training guarantee legislation, unless one makes the training available&mdash;an additional tax will be charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the publicity which the superannuation guarantee legislation has received in recent days, it is instructive to remind the House again of the conclusions of the Federal Treasury which were submitted to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquiry on the superannuation legislation. Those conclusions were to the effect that, unless the levy replaced wage increases or other increases in emoluments, it could result in job losses of up to 100,000 people over a period of five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinary paradox, it is an extraordinary contradiction, it is a very strange irony indeed that, at a time when we have an unemployment level of over 10 1/2 per cent and a youth unemployment level of over 30 per cent, there is general agreement right across the political spectrum that the issue which most concerns Australians, most concerns Australian families, most worries Australian parents, is of course the issue of job security. It really is an extraordinary irony that the Government should be pressing ahead with a piece of legislation which is calculated, in the eye of its own major economic adviser, to add about 100,000 people to the dole queues over the next five years. It does display an extraordinary insensitivity to the major social and economic challenge that faces Australia at the present time. Of course, the reason why that legislation has been proceeded with&mdash;indeed, the reason why the training guarantee amendment legislation, or the original legislation, was proceeded with&mdash;is to discharge what can only be described as a broad ideological commitment to centralised direction in this area of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all believe in superannuation. We all believe in adequate training. The view of the Government is that we should extract it through the fiat of the industrial relations system using the taxation power when it comes to superannuation, and in relation to training we should extract it through a training guarantee approach which contains many fundamental errors. As was made plain in November of last year, when the Opposition's Fightback plan was produced, one of the seven taxes that will be abolished under the coalition government after the next election is, of course, the tax which is involved in the training guarantee administration legislation, along with the job destroying payroll tax, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the abolition of the Federal petroleum excise which collects about $6m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying again that this particular proposal contains an improvement on a fundamentally flawed system. It is the view of the Opposition that there is no good, commonsense purpose achieved in voting against something which will make a piece of legislation, which is fundamentally flawed, slightly less objectionable. For that reason we will not be attempting to deny passage of the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members will be aware following the speech by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the training guarantee scheme is an important aspect of the Government's training proposals and is one which binds employers of large numbers of people into making proper provision for their training. I am sure the people of Australia are aware that training was not always carried out adequately across the board prior to the introduction of this legislation. That is not to say that many employers did not do a very good job of training, but unfortunately they were not always the employers who needed to do the training. As with many things in government and elsewhere, one finds that the people we are trying to educate are the ones who require the education. Therefore, steps need to be taken to lead them in the right direction. That is very much what the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act is all about. This amendment is to improve the application of the Act specifically in terms of the ability of people to undertake work experience and vocational practice, especially high school or post-compulsory students and teachers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee scheme came into effect on 1 July 1990, and it requires employers to spend a minimum amount on training. The levy was introduced as part of the Labor Government's ongoing policy of developing the environment necessary for Australian industry to become more competitive internationally by stimulating its commitment to training and thus increasing the skills in the work force. We have had a number of reports to this Parliament and elsewhere in Australia on the need, indeed the necessity, of having proper skills in our work force, even in an economic downturn, so that we can be ready for the time when the economy recovers. Of course, that is beginning to happen now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Primarily, this Bill provides for changes to the training guarantee scheme in keeping with a recommendation of the Finn report of July 1991 on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training. That report has been talked about quite a lot in this place. Other reports which have also informed the debate in this area of post-compulsory education and training include two reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who is in the House, are members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's initial report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>, which was dated October 1989, considered not only the position of post-compulsory students and their access to training, but also the relevance of the education that they received in years 10, 11 and 12. The other report of the Committee, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Training for the 21st Century</EMPHASIS>, was brought down in December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reports were, of course, followed in March 1992 by the report of the Employment and Skills Formation Council titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Vocational Certificate Training System</EMPHASIS>, which is better known as the Carmichael report, to which the honourable member for Bennelong also referred in his remarks. This report made a number of recommendations related to providing multiple, flexible pathways to accommodate the needs and circumstances of most young people in Australia. That is a very important report. I think that the proposals in the Bill today lead us in that direction as well because they allow for a substantive change in the way that training occurs for people under the age of 21 in post-compulsory education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, this Bill allows work experience and practice for students and teachers to be included in the eligible training program of an employer. As a consequence, it leads to closer links between industry and education, which is a benefit that I think we cannot understate. This change creates an incentive for employers to provide work experience and practice opportunities, both of which are key ingredients in education and training. Such opportunities prepare young people for entry into the work force and improve the ability of teachers to help their students meet industry needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is often left out of the education process; it has been in the past. I do not think we would want to see a return to the point where industry's needs are the only factors that operate in terms of education, but I believe that it is important that the employability of people when they leave school is taken into account. To that degree, the closer the relationship between industry and education the better. We are seeing much more interest in this country now at the level of industry in contributing to schools and to other training institutions not just because of the training guarantee, but certainly partly as a consequence of it. I believe it has helped to a large degree in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill targets full time students in year 10 or above who are under 21 years of age and undertaking full time courses in most schools and education-training institutions. Students must be full time in order to avoid inappropriate use of the provisions such as employers releasing their employees for part time study and being able to claim their employees' costs as eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar provision is made, of course, for full time teachers in schools and institutions. It is recognised that, whilst part time teachers may have&mdash;not necessarily, but usually&mdash;the opportunity to improve their position and gain some work experience, that is not always the case for full time teachers who are obviously caught up in one way or another in their role in academia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also specifies that there be an agreement between the teacher and the training institution, and the training institution and the provider of work experience, which includes the terms and conditions under which the teacher may undertake work experience. This is, of course, important in order to ensure that only genuine and formal work experience arrangements apply to full time teachers. It is consistent with the aim of encouraging teachers to acquire industry experience and knowledge so that they can then pass this knowledge on to students when they return to the teaching institution. The significance of that is that teachers can be involved in industry, gain work experience and then come back into the classroom and inform the students of their decisions and discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know some people feel that the same should apply to public servants. That is a matter which is currently under consideration by one of the committees of this Parliament. It is felt that we ought try to ensure that we provide not only a generalist education for our students, our teachers and our public servants, but also that they should have the opportunity, as often as is practicable and possible, to test their experience and their theories in the wider workplace, to inform themselves and to broaden their horizons by not remaining too closeted in any area of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most honourable members would be aware, if an employer does not spend the requisite percentage of payroll on eligible training, he or she has two choices which bear repeating at this juncture. The employer can, using the shortfall statement, pay the shortfall to the Taxation Office&mdash;and I suspect that is something not many of them would want to do&mdash;or the employer can make a donation of the shortfall to another person or organisation. The training guarantee does not specify to whom the donation should be made, but the legislation does state that the employer must make the donation in order for the other person or organisation to carry out training activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I would encourage&mdash;and I hope that other people have already done so&mdash;employers to look at community groups such as Skillshare, with a view to providing them with that donation if they cannot think of anything better to do with it. Those groups have an obligation to get community sponsorship however they can, and employers are obviously the most desirable donors. These groups will then undertake training in the community, and I imagine that employers would also benefit from this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When making the donation to the recipient, the employer must advise the recipient that he or she is making the donation solely for any of the following uses: determining the need for eligible training programs; and/or preparing and reviewing strategic and other plans in relation to eligible training programs; and/or developing, providing, evaluating and administering eligible training; and/or developing and administering accounting and information systems in relation to eligible training programs. One can see that these donations are designed to be used specifically for training, training mechanisms and administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, community groups such as Skillshare committees are suitable for such donations. Alternatively, employers may choose to send their money to a local senior high school which may be attempting to develop training programs. One of the schools in my electorate&mdash;which, in fact, borders on your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;the Balga Senior High School, has been trying for some time to develop a school/industry mentor program or traineeship which, I think, some of the employers in the region may have an interest in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its proposal is designed to assist students undertaking post-compulsory education to participate in meaningful and relevant education combined with a significant proportion of vocational activity. That proposal differs from the proposals of this Bill, as the students, whilst allegedly being in full time education, would actually in the vocational sense be part time in the work force and part time in education. This would enable disadvantaged students or people from low social economic backgrounds to create a relevant environment within which to improve their learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very good scheme. It is one that has not yet been funded, and I will certainly be attempting to seek assistance from any of the Ministers or members present to try to work out a way to get that scheme funded. There is some doubt as to whether it comes under youth at risk or whether it would fall into the normal sorts of DEET programs. I certainly hope that even at a pilot level a program of that nature could be funded because it very much links in with the proposals contained in the Bill today for the training guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also links in very much with the Carmichael report and recognises, as did the Finn report and the other reports of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, that those people who are not currently participating effectively or actively in post-compulsory education are the people from working class or poor homes where perhaps there is financial pressure on them not to continue with education or where the education system, because they do not have a goal of university but have a more practical orientation, does not provide what they think they need. Some more emphasis on vocational training during their post-compulsory schooling period would certainly assist those students. That has been my experience from the committees in which I have been involved and the reports that have come down in this Parliament. I hope that we can do something about a program of this nature and importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The teachers at Balga Senior High School ought to be congratulated for having tried so hard over a 12-month period to negotiate this matter through with all the unions and the Government and having tried to make sure that the students themselves and the employers will have a decent outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the Government has persisted with the training guarantee. I am pleased, too, to see that it is rendering it more relevant through the provisions of this Bill and especially more relevant to those people who are undertaking post-compulsory education but who require more of a vocational orientation than has previously been the case and previously been allowed in terms of the training guarantee provisions. This will encourage employers to look to the younger people, and their teachers to improve the skills and aptitude of those younger people, so they can better participate in the community as continuing employees, and that will be better for Australia. </PARA>

As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stated earlier in his remarks, it is to be expected in this place today that this will be largely a bipartisan debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise that over the past two years a number of significant reports have been brought down, discussed in this place and are currently still under discussion throughout the wider community. They relate to the broad issue of training, which is what we are really here to discuss today. The first significant report was the report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years</EMPHASIS>. It looked at post-compulsory education for young people in terms of senior secondary schooling. It was an important report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that the Minister at the time did not respond to that report for, as I recall, some 18 months. The report had a great deal to offer, and if we today go back and examine it we will find that many of those recommendations hold as true today as they did when that Committee, which was not of this Parliament but of the Parliament before, brought down the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that report was the so-called Deveson report, which inquired into the training costs of award restructuring. That was really the first attempt to start a major look at TAFE, at our training systems and at what is perceived to be a major problem in terms of structure in the whole ambit of the education system in Australia. The Deveson report said that we could no longer simply rely on TAFE for all of our training needs and that, if we were going to be able to afford training for skills in Australia, we had to devolve some of the costs from the public purse down to the individual who would receive the training, to the State governments and to industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Deveson report, the Employment and Skills Formation Council, under the direction of Charles Halton, brought down a report essentially into entry level training. It established a mechanism for discussing what sort of a system we should eventually evolve that will supply the training necessary for young people to enter the real world of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that report was the now very well-known Finn report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training</EMPHASIS>. The Finn report set targets for the first time for participation in skills training and in all manner of education by our young people. It is a very important document. The Finn report will remain current, I am certain, for a substantial period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Finn report, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Training for the 21st Century</EMPHASIS>. We consider that this is a most important report because it follows on the work of Deveson, Halton and Finn and the earlier work of the Committee itself. It attempts to bring together information regarding all of the issues that we believe are pertinent to how we should go about restructuring the training side of the education bureaucracy, the education systems in Australia. So it is an important report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am personally disappointed that that report has not received the attention in the education circles, the bureaucracy or the press that one might have hoped it would generate. It took some 18 months while we travelled around Australia and discussed training issues not only with the bureaucracies in the various States and in Canberra, but also, more specifically, with industry, union representatives and employers and employees on work sites. We covered a great range of issues that are most important, some of which I will cover briefly in my remarks today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following our report is the Carmichael report, which inquires into the mechanisms that we will use to get young people actively into the work force and to change our basic entry level systems from our current apprenticeship and traineeship systems into something quite different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Mr Deveson brought down a second report, this time not a Federal report but a report of the State of Victoria. Mr Deveson is the Chairman of the Training Council of the State of Victoria. This second report attempts to pick up some of the recommendations that we have made and some of the recommendations of Finn in structure, in how we balance general academic education in our high schools and/or in TAFE, and how we physically accomplish that in terms of the VCE in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All of these reports go to address our overall national problem of an insufficient level of training. We have all agreed that our young people have too few mechanisms to continue their vocational training. We agree that we have done a terrific job over the last decade of encouraging young people to continue in education, so that participation rates in secondary schools today are quite high compared with the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a whole host of reasons Australia has decided that education is important. Those reasons include the fact that our economy has been opened up to a large extent to the world so that some of our previous attitudes, which were developed behind high tariff walls and behind an attitude of protectionism, have been blown away; the cobwebs have disappeared in the winds of change that have been swept up by our internationalisation. That is very positive. It has encouraged people to understand that without high levels of education and without good training skills we are unlikely to be so competitive in a very competitive world; that we are unlikely to be able to take our place in international debates and discussions without the same level of education as the people that we are discussing issues with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes of attitude are important. They have helped our young people go to school. Part of the reason for the increase in participation is our severe recession today. Part of the increase is due to a bureaucratic or financial change in terms of providing Austudy for senior secondary students. It really comes together to mean that people have accepted the need for education and training. But what we have not done is provide the mechanisms nor the desire for that same level of participation in skill acquisition, in what we call training, as we have in general education, which leads young people to diplomas in secondary schools and entry into university for university degrees.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these reports attempt to address that major structural problem because we do not compete with our OECD partners when it comes to skill acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Training Guarantee Act was established by this Government for very positive reasons. I acknowledge that the Minister had in his heart the right desires when he brought down the Act. But it is my view that any act of compulsion is an act which, ultimately in a free society, must fail. For my own part, I would have us encourage employers to increase the training of their work force and I would have us educate employers to the need for training and the benefits of that training both in a social sense and, more particularly, in an economic sense, because certainly it has been proved time and time again that things such as quality, productivity and job interest are significantly enhanced with higher levels of skill acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that has kept us behind in that respect has been our archaic, centralised industrial relations system. That system itself has tended to say that only an electrician can change a light bulb, and only a plumber can change a tap washer. We all agree that today in this world of competition we can no longer afford those kinds of attitudes and those sorts of inefficiencies. So we talk about training systems today that are broad-based in nature. We need to encourage employers to take up efforts to train their work force. But compelling them to train their work force will not necessarily achieve the objectives we desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out to the House the fact that many groups of employers reported to our Committee that they have actually reduced the amount of real training they are doing with their personnel because of the extreme costs of record keeping associated with this Act. In particular, the retail trade, which is a huge business, as one would know, and which is a huge training market, has found that the cost of record keeping is so high that it has had to reduce the training of employees in order&mdash;in this time of recession&mdash;to keep its costs at a level to allow it to make even meagre profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many reports in the press of rip-offs and rorts under the Training Guarantee Act with the use of mechanisms such as boat trips and conferences overseas for management which fulfil the taxation requirements of the Act but which do not fulfil the intent of the Act. This is, after all, a taxation measure. It is a measure which says that if companies do not fulfil what we say are their obligations for training then they will pay a tax; that tax is not tax deductible. From my own viewpoint, I would say that, while the Act has been to some extent successful in that it has tended to market the need for training, it has been unsuccessful in that much of the additional training has been developed in areas which will not serve our future needs, and always, as a philosophical matter, compulsion is doomed to fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that all of these reports address is one that we should consider here today&mdash;senior secondary schools. In the last decade in many parts of Australia we had schools which attended themselves to vocational training; we called this streaming. Some proportion of the student population was directed into academic schools, where they studied a broad range of curricula and came out, theoretically, as well-rounded individuals with an ability to think and a further ability to learn. Some students, for whatever reason&mdash;it could be that they liked working with their hands or thought they would like to be a plumber, a carpenter or a bricklayer, or because they were not particularly good at academic pursuits&mdash;were directed into vocational or technical schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, Australian society decried that streaming and said that it did not serve us well; that it really made out of the training market a second class education market for second class people producing second class results. So we got rid of our training schools and, in the process, we put ourselves at the bottom of the OECD in terms of skill acquisition and providing skills training for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that our Committee has found&mdash;and this latest Deveson report finds, and I am certain Carmichael and Finn both support&mdash;is the concept of senior secondary schools where we go back to a bit of streaming again; that is to say, students in a school are allowed to take a path towards general education or take a path towards vocational education with certification of their skills which they can use in industry when they leave what we call high school. This opportunity provides students with the chance to move back and forth between the two, so that a young person studying hairdressing in years 11 and 12 might also take a history course or a philosophy course or a course in journalism, and a student destined for Melbourne University or Sydney University to study law or medicine might take time out of their year's study and do a course in drafting or a course in carpentry, or they might take a small course in hairdressing. These combined schools which offer students a vocational path or an academic path would allow them to pick and choose between one and the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Committee visited two senior secondary colleges in Queensland, which apparently do an excellent job. The college at Hervey Bay in Queensland has outstanding results both in retention rates and in acceptance of its students in university or in the real world of work. Its students have a very high degree of success in getting jobs when they leave, if they wish jobs, or in going on to further education in university or further training in TAFE, if that is the direction in which they wish to go. These schools are based, as we hope all other training systems in Australia will be based in the not too distant future, on an attitude of competency rather than a strict requirement for time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have pointed out, the apprenticeship system is a nonsense in that it is based on a master-slave relationship, which we gave away a long time ago. In terms of training, the apprenticeship system is based on time. Apprentices spend four or five years and, regardless of whether they learn anything or pass the course, they come out at the end as a plumber, carpenter, bricklayer or whatever it was that they intended to be. That system served us well in the past. Today is not the past and we do not have master-slave relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, people on all sides of politics and throughout the bureaucracy agree that we must rapidly move to a system of competency-based training which allows young people particularly to advance through the training system at their own pace, in their own time, and to achieve real outcomes in the world of work at the earliest possible opportunity. The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. </PARA>

The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) mentioned electricians once or twice in his contribution. I served an apprenticeship as an electrician and went on to teach in TAFE. Having that background, I am very encouraged by many of the things that are happening. I want to take issue with a few of the points the honourable member made, but in general terms I think most of what he said would find favour with many Government members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, compelling people is not the best way to get them to do things. Good management is all about getting people to do things willingly. In an ideal world, that is what would happen. But when we are talking about changing attitudes, entrenched as they are in Australia and Australian management, sometimes we have to compel people to do things, such as with the training guarantee levy. The training guarantee levy would, with all factors taken into consideration, lead to those attitudes changing faster than they otherwise would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the introduction of the training guarantee levy, a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 29 April this year said, `Levy lifts training spending by $700m, but Australia still lags'. The fact that the levy led to an extra $700m being spent on training seems to indicate that without the training guarantee levy, the training effort would have been that much less. I do not know the veracity of those figures. Nobody put a name to the article. If we take the article at face value, even if the figure is out, the levy has lifted the training effort in Australia, and, from the Government's point of view, it certainly has been a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that we need to encourage and educate employers, as the honourable member mentioned. I think that is happening now that we are competing with the world and we look at how other countries operate and how other management systems work. The honourable member made a point about record-keeping instead of training. I can imagine that people would say that. I can imagine that before any committee there would be employers saying that they did not like to keep records for the Australian Taxation Office. But we have to wonder about how they are running their businesses if they do not know where their money is going. It seems to me that they are comparing the way they run their businesses now with how they used to run them before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia many businesses fail because proper records are not kept and moneys are not accounted for. If the training guarantee levy has forced some firms to be more stringent in their bookkeeping than they otherwise would be, that is a good thing. Not only will they benefit from that in the long run; they might find their businesses improving as a result of that better bookkeeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I did an apprenticeship in the 1960s. I know all about apprenticeships: being indentured to a company, serving that company and coming out as a tradesman. In the past it has served us well, but I agree with the honourable member that there needs to be a broader approach. It is the old catch-22 situation: people do not get training unless they get a job, and it is very hard to get a job, especially in times when the economy is either recessed or in a slowdown. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the importance of education in Australia has never been taken as seriously as it should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience in TAFE, I know that TAFE was born out of the Kangan report in 1974, which was introduced during the term of the Whitlam Government by the then Minister for Education, Mr Beazley. I suppose that there is some sort of irony in the circumstance that today his son, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), is the Minister in charge of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kangan report was the first report that looked at training, which I think was always considered the poor relation in vocational education. It never had a central focus. In the old days it was said that everybody knew what primary and secondary education were about and everybody knew what universities did, and all the functions not covered by those two umbrellas fell into what was then called `tech'. The Kangan report was the first report that looked at lifelong training. It was the first report that seriously looked at the way in which we should position ourselves in the world. It said that training should not be undertaken just once&mdash;for example, by doing an apprenticeship and then stopping; as technology moved on, education had to move with it. Back in those days the retention rates were very low&mdash;around 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was working as an electrician, most of the electricians that I worked with were not locally trained. Most of them came from overseas. It seems to me that back in the 1960s and 1970s migration was the way we skilled Australia. Rather than developing our own skills, we imported our skills. Comparisons with any other countries that are doing better than Australia point to the obvious fact that those countries skill their own people rather than rely on importing skills from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That system reflected the view of the governments of those days. The education system was a good barometer as to how the governments of the 1960s and 1970s viewed Australia. The industry of Australia was basically very small. We were content to dig up rocks and send them overseas in the form of unprocessed minerals and buy them back again as finished products. We did the same with agricultural products. I suppose the education system of the day matched the industry that existed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this Government has come to office, there has been a dramatic change in attitudes, an opening up of the Australian economy, and a priority given to education. Not only are the retention rates approaching 80 per cent, up from the 30 per cent I talked about before; there are also an extra 120,000 full time places in higher education. In relation to labour market programs, the Government has introduced four key reforms: the Skillshare program in 1989; the jobs, education and training package for sole parents in March 1989; the disability reform package in November 1991; and the Newstart program in July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms have brought Australia's income support system and the labour market training systems together to increase the training efforts for those people. The total expenditure on labour market programs has been increased from $400m in 1990-91 to $683m this year, an increase of 70 per cent in one year. The initiatives announced in the One Nation statement will take expenditure to $870m in 1992-93. This will boost the number of Australians assisted to about 350,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to TAFE the Government has already injected an extra $100m over and above its normal funding commitment for 1992. In February this year it was announced that a special package of $33m would be given to boost incentives for apprentices and trainees because of the recessed economy. We normally find that firms will take on apprentices when the economy is at its peak and will lay them off in the troughs. That is usually countercyclical to the actual demand. When we come out of a recession the demand for skilled tradesmen goes up. It is usually the time when firms that have not invested in apprentices during the recessed period of the economy find themselves short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $33m will go a long way to making sure that the apprenticeship system and the traineeship system continue to take in increasing numbers of young people so that hopefully their skills will be available when the economy comes out of recession. On top of these measures the One Nation statement defined the Government's commitment to the establishment of a new higher status, better resourced system of vocational education and training, and the Commonwealth will inject $720m over the 1993-95 triennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, as two speakers have said, does not oppose this Bill. The one thing that is disappointing is that the Opposition has signalled that, should it become the government, it will get rid of the training guarantee levy. We find the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member Goldstein (Dr Kemp), saying that we must increase private investment in training but Fightback promises the immediate abolition of the training guarantee levy despite its acknowledged success in expanded private training effort. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 29 April this year, under the heading `Training market tipped to double', said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry training market is expected to double in the next five years in Australia as a result of an increase in the training guarantee levy, coupled with moves by industry to increase productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>The training guarantee levy is working, the runs are on the board, and we now see that the private training effort looks like doubling in the next five years;  yet the Opposition, should it become the Government, will put all that at risk by abolishing the training guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member who spoke prior to me talked about compulsion. The one thing we have noticed about the Opposition is that it always likes freedom of choice. That goes a long way to explaining its approach to many things, whether it be taxation, health insurance, superannuation or any number of things. Its approach has always been freedom to choose. Of course, freedom to choose assumes that everybody is equal, everybody can afford to choose, irrespective of the area, whether it be education or health. But people are not equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases government intervention is necessary, as it has been in this case. If we abolished the training guarantee levy and said to employers, `It is up to you now; you have the freedom to train if you want to', we would find a significant number of employers&mdash;I will not say all&mdash;going back to the old ways. That was where they put in no training effort, but were happy to poach workers from other companies that did put in that effort, in many cases just by offering more money for the skills they needed. That is counterproductive in the end. The Government believes that the training effort should be spread across employers, and the training guarantee levy is committed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that the Opposition will not oppose this Bill. I would ask those opposite to review their position on the training guarantee levy. As time goes on we will find that the initial success of the levy that we are talking about today will become self-evident and, should it become the government, the Opposition should really look at retaining this program. Of course, I do not think we have much to fear about the Opposition gaining government, at least in the short term. Under this Government vocational training has come a long way. We have a long way to go, but I think the Government will be here to see it develop and prosper in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not oppose these amendments because they improve the operation of the training guarantee scheme, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has mentioned. It does that while there are a number of technical amendments contained in this Bill which should serve to clarify the training guarantee law for employers. While the Opposition will not be opposing the amendments, we certainly do not support the training guarantee scheme as a whole. That is one thing the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) got right in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition opposed this legislation when it was first presented to the House in May 1990. In the coalition's Fightback package we have committed ourselves to the abolition of the training guarantee scheme as part of the overall tax relief to be provided to taxpayers under that package. Not only will we eliminate this compulsory tax, a tax on payrolls, but we will also eliminate the payroll tax per se, along with the wholesale sales tax and the petrol tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of what the coalition thinks of the training guarantee scheme, it should be pointed out that the whole edifice rests on some very shaky legal ground. Indeed, there are good reasons for believing that the entire scheme is unconstitutional and would be very vulnerable to a major legal challenge. At least one leading barrister, Mr Bryan Pape, has argued in an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation in Australia</EMPHASIS>, the publication of the Taxation Institute of Australia, that the training guarantee scheme is unconstitutional. He cites three reasons for the unconstitutionality of the levy. First, the scheme does not fall within any of the enumerated heads of power contained in section 51 of the Constitution. Pape argues that the scheme is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">repugnant to the working of section 51 of the Constitution;  it renders the other paragraphs of section 51 nugatory and would potentially convert the Federation into a unitary system of government.</PARA>
<PARA>The other two reasons for believing that the tax may be unconstitutional are that the legislation purports to regulate conduct, rather than to raise revenue, and that the so-called tax is, in truth, a penalty so as to compel or guarantee the observance of a law beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee scheme has resulted in a situation where the Government has sought to use its taxing powers to penalise what is otherwise entirely legitimate behaviour on the part of employers. It is not necessary to go into these legal arguments against the training guarantee scheme any further, except to note that in this, as in so many other matters, we would be substantially better off if the Commonwealth and the High Court had, over the years, remained true to the intentions of the founding fathers of the Federation in their interpretation of our Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee scheme is an onerous burden on business in Australia, and yet it does little to improve the quality of training activity by Australian employers. The scheme does nothing to ensure that eligible training expenditures are in fact for the purposes of training particular categories of employees, rather than just for training the senior management people who have always been the major beneficiaries of the training expenditure of our larger corporations. Under the scheme, eligible training expenditure can equally take the form of sending a firm's managing director to expensive conferences overseas, rather than for the purposes of training rank and file employees in new skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, for the purposes of the scheme, eligible training expenditure can take place anywhere in the world, not just in Australia, making substantiation of the true nature of the relevant training expenditure very difficult indeed. It is hardly surprising to find, therefore, that many Australian businesses and their employees view the training scheme as a rort to be exploited, rather than as an incentive to maximise the extent and the value of their training expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, however, the training guarantee legislation represents a minefield for employers in meeting their obligation to spend the equivalent of one per cent of their payrolls on so-called structured training&mdash;thereby the accusation which we fairly level that this is simply another payroll tax on top of the existing payroll tax levied by the States. The training guarantee levy is to rise again to 1.5 per cent in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous uncertainty as to what qualifies as eligible training expenditure for the purposes of the scheme. This has resulted in many employers resorting to spending their scarce funds on known eligible training expenditure that may not be entirely relevant to their needs, rather than taking risks with more relevant training expenditure that may not qualify as a result of a subsequent audit by the Australian Taxation Office. In other words, eligibility considerations override commonsense and relevant training requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is part of a wider problem with the training guarantee scheme, which is that it takes no account of the needs of individual firms, much like our archaic system of industrial awards and centralised wage-fixing system. The Government presumes that it knows better than the many firms that are affected by the scheme as to how they should best spend their training funds. It should be obvious that for many firms the expenditure of the equivalent of one per cent of their payroll on structured training may be totally inappropriate to their identifiable needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses may have urgent priorities in other areas of potential investment that they will now be unable to meet because they will be required to spend their limited funds on structured training. Thus, important investment opportunities may be missed due to the need to fulfil obligations under the training guarantee levy. The scheme also ignores the fact that many firms do not, or would not, choose to allocate their training expenditure on an annualised basis. For many firms it would be most profitable to spend heavily on training in one year, but with little or no expenditure on training in subsequent years while the firm benefits from its initial concentrated investment in workplace skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the training guarantee scheme, however, such a firm is required to spend the minimum amount each year or incur a penalty. So the firm is forced into suboptimal training expenditure, detrimental to its overall profitability. The training guarantee scheme also completely ignores the fact that formal structured training may be completely irrelevant to the needs of some businesses. Many businesses are far better served by the many possibilities for informal training that may exist in the workplace. Instead, these firms are now forced to spend money on forms of training that may be totally inappropriate to their needs, reducing workplace and overall productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many firms, rather than attempting to restructure their training activities to meet the requirements of the Act, have purchased expensive training packages totally superfluous to their requirements, such that the additional expenditure on training coerced from businesses under the Act is in many cases simply wasted. Consequently, the opportunity cost of the expenditures misallocated as a result of the training guarantee scheme may be the greatest cost of all imposed on Australian businesses, and the Australian economy, as a result of the training guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this sort of distortion should ever have been introduced into the Australian economy is bad enough, but in the present economic climate and the worst recession in 60 years, it is nothing short of outrageous. These costs are totally unquantifiable, which is probably just as well, since they are likely to be extremely large in the context of training expenditure in Australia. Not only does the training guarantee scheme detract from the quality of training expenditure in Australia; it also imposes an enormous compliance burden upon Australian business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that under the training guarantee scheme any expenditure incurred in keeping the records necessary to substantiate eligible training expenditure under the Act actually counts towards that very same eligible training expenditure. This means that an employer's training guarantee liability can, in large part, be met simply by developing accounting systems to keep track of the remaining expenditure. Thus, the scheme has generated a compliance bureaucracy that in many cases returns little in terms of increased training. There could be no better illustration of the futile nature of the legislation than that, I suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compliance burden falls on all firms above the payroll threshold for the scheme, even if those firms have for many years been spending well above the required minimum amount on eligible training. The $200,000 payroll threshold means that 15 per cent of all employers in Australia are affected by the scheme. Of these employers, some 42 per cent, who employ nearly 75 per cent of the work force, already spend an average of 2.2 per cent of their payrolls on training, thereby meeting their obligations under the scheme. But this means that the employers of nearly 75 per cent of the work force must meet the full range of compliance responsibilities under the training guarantee scheme without a single extra dollar being spent on training as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have generated a vast compliance burden for Australian businesses for the purposes of substantiating eligible training expenditure that was already taking place well before the imposition of the training guarantee levy. The relevant records need to be kept for five years, during which time the Tax Office may require the employer to substantiate all eligible training expenditure as a result of a random audit. The cost involved in meeting these compliance responsibilities alone probably far exceeds the increase in training expenditure that has been brought about as a result of the training guarantee scheme. The training guarantee levy is thus totally counterproductive in bringing about an increase in the quality and quantity of training expenditure in Australia, which is the scheme's stated objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a scheme that would be more at home in one of the world's few remaining command economies, rather than in a supposedly capitalist country such as Australia. It is regulation run riot. The training guarantee scheme is not only totally ineffective in achieving its stated objectives, it is also conceptually flawed. It assumes that there is some serious shortfall in the amount of training expenditure taking place in Australia at present, or at least that took place prior to the scheme's introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has its origins in the Government's 1988 discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industry Training in Australia: The Need for Change</EMPHASIS>, which drew some unfavourable comparisons between Australia and some overseas countries in the amount we spend on training. It is this concentration on spending which so often drives legislation under Labor. But the overall figures tell us very little about the adequacy or otherwise of training expenditure in Australia. They fail to take account of the particular characteristics of the education and industrial relations systems of the various countries with which we can be compared, and that can result in all sorts of anomalies arising in broad aggregates such as those the Government has used to justify the training guarantee levy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that these broad aggregate figures led the Government to adopt a blanket solution by coercing a minimum level of training expenditure from all Australian businesses, regardless of the relevance of the expenditure to their particular needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to argue that there is some general shortfall in the amount of money that Australian businesses allocate to training expenditure, it is necessary to postulate some general market value whereby Australian business fails to recognise its interest in spending an appropriate amount on training.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As has already been indicated, there is no way of knowing what the appropriate level of training expenditure for Australia really is, even in comparison with other countries. But, more to the point, there is no evidence to support the proposition that Australian business is or was lacking an awareness of the value of training in its productive development and, consequently, the future economic development of Australia. It may lack some of the necessary incentives to undertake training expenditure, but that is an argument for removing those disincentives rather than seeking to coerce the deemed levels of expenditure out of business in spite of those disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Barry Maley, one of the leading critics of the training guarantee scheme has noted, the scheme ignores:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the importance, and priority, of establishing competition between enterprises and within the labour market to create the essential incentives for employers and employees to undertake appropriate training commitments. This deficiency is compounded by the centralised award system and minimum wage obligations that inhibit innovative contracts between employers, employees and school-leavers that could act as incentives to skills acquisition.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that sound familiar? It is the very reasoning behind the coalition's industrial relations policy and some of the other elements of our Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a problem with the level of training expenditure in Australia, it is more likely to reside in our antiquated industrial relations system rather than in any lack of foresight on the part of Australian businesses.

Hayek as `the fatal conceit'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992 and to support the notion of the training guarantee levy. It is most interesting to hear Opposition speakers oppose the levy and the training which emanates from that, given their own desire to impose a goods and services tax on small businesses in Australia and in fact force an enormous amount of compliance on them in that regard. However, industry in Australia has failed miserably in its attempt to create a skilled work force which would meet the demands of the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Australian industry is second last in the OECD countries in terms of training, the quality of training and the level of training which operates within its work force. Indeed, only Greece trains its workers less than Australia. In a country as rich as Australia, this surely is a crime. The area in which industry is involved in training&mdash;that is, the TAFE system&mdash;has also been proven to be the cinderella segment of our whole education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last few years the States have continued to ensure that even less money has been spent within the TAFE sector than previously and have provided for even fewer people to train in real vocational and industry based training than has been necessary. The training guarantee levy is a response to that and is a mechanism to stimulate industry's commitment to training. Why do we have it? Why is it necessary? Who is being trained?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard all sorts of stories from the other side of the House as to why and what can happen. Indeed, we heard the same kinds of stories when we saw the end of fringe benefits for industry. Most of those people in industry claimed then that the lunches which they had and the kinds of things which were claimed under fringe benefits were in fact training. One of the Opposition members now claims that the training guarantee levy is viewed as a rort, hence in some part the Government is responsible for that. I would say that if industry views the levy as a rort, that is an indication of its own inability to respond to the training needs of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the earlier speakers have taken us through the whole issue of training and the kinds of reports which have been brought out, including the Finn report and our own House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Training for the 21st Century:  A Report on Skills Training:  Apprenticeships and Traineeships</EMPHASIS>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question and no doubt that government, industry and unions alike all deplore the level of training in the Australian work force. It is the responsibility of all of us. It is the failure of industry, in the first part, to take the initiative itself that has driven the Government into pursuing the training guarantee levy. I might point out that many of our large companies spend considerably more than one per cent on training, but a group of companies which employ more than half our work force have failed to spend any money at all on training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the training guarantee levy does is provide for training courses that are structured and have no significant object other than training. If we are talking about a training guarantee levy, I am sure that not only industry but also those people on whom the money is being spent need a guarantee that what they are doing is meaningful and worth while. If industry itself cannot decide what it needs and how it must train its work force, it is in a more sorry state than any of us imagined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the training guarantee levy allows for is that industries can buy training from some of our very large institutions. It also means that, for the first time in many years, institutions have a marriage with industry. I am forced to cite an example of this from my own electorate, where Toyota has a very large truck factory at which, rather than by a line process, it makes trucks in a stable manner&mdash;that is, it has a team of workers who together create and build one truck. Toyota has a very large training component; it employs a large number of apprentices and so on. But what is more important is that Toyota has those facilities there. It seems extraordinary that private industry providing facilities at that level should not find some support for that, perhaps in the public sector, and provide a sharing of ideas and a sharing of worth and so on through both the TAFE system and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, as well, institutions such as the Queensland University of Technology have found a way in which to expand many of their courses and to meet the demands of industry through the training guarantee levy. Industries have found that for one per cent they can have the provision of facilities that are indeed very rarely going to be available to them as individuals because they simply could not finance them but, by participating in the training guarantee levy and participating in schemes run by the Queensland University of Technology, they have access to facilities that are first class, to teaching that is first class and to courses that are actually moulded to meet the needs of their particular industry. The House of Representatives Committee was delighted, as are many honourable members in this House, that literacy is one of the courses that can be covered by the training guarantee levy. If honourable members had read the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at Work</EMPHASIS>, they would know that one of the great difficulties that have come about in the changing work force has been the impact of the illiteracy of many of our workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move to skill our work force and move to multiskill and to restructure industry, one of the factors that have made for great difficulties is that many of our workers have not had the functional ability to read and write sufficiently in English to be able to work to the demands of new and changing technology and new and changing structures. I have visited a number of factories where this was recognised. They, of their own volition, have instituted literacy courses for their workers. In any instance, one can see that this is industry responding to its own demands in its own way with its own structured courses. This is what the training guarantee levy offers; not the kind of constraints which we heard elaborated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the kinds of constraints which the previous speakers pointed out are simply not true. The training guarantee levy offers an opportunity for each particular industry&mdash;each particular site, in fact&mdash;to look at its training needs, to assess its training needs and then to work through those. If they find themselves not in a position to provide such courses and such facilities, then they are in a position to spend some money on them, and perhaps other institutions and other groups within the community who have skills and expertise can do some of the training for them and create a cooperative spirit. So, what the training guarantee levy offers for the first time in our community is a real marriage between industry and government in this training process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with interest one of the points which was made last night in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline </EMPHASIS>program about the Australian components group, where one of the people on the shop floor noted the various changes in management style which had been brought about, and with it a rise in productivity and, of course, a fall in industrial disputation. There is no doubt&mdash;and all the research would show&mdash;that a more highly skilled work force, a work force that participates and understands the production and the activities of the company for whom and with whom it is working, brings about considerably higher productivity levels, as well as lowering industrial disputation. Indeed, the last thing that industry wants or needs is a return to the kinds of days, certainly through the 1970s and the early 1980s, when we had an enormous amount of disputation and a huge number of working days lost. In the House the other day the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out that this year Australia has seen the lowest levels of disputation in industry in 30 years. Surely, at last we have seen industry working in cooperation; industry working with employer and employee working together to create a more viable and more profitable environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy is, of course, one of the mechanisms to enable that to happen. I am sometimes dismayed at the fact that members of the Opposition suggest that we should not keep children at school any longer; it is simply a way of stopping them from becoming unemployed&mdash;this is simply not true. The demands of society and of our life now mean that all of us need to be much better trained and much more highly skilled. Since industry itself has failed to recognise this and failed to respond to it, it becomes the role of government. It is not simply a question of government knowing best; it is simply that there is nobody else to do such work or to provide the stimulus to industry to force industry along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other interesting aspects of this Bill is the provision for work experience for teachers. This certainly arose out of Deveson and Finn, and out of our own House of Representatives Committee report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Skills Training for the 21st Century</EMPHASIS>, which pointed out that one of the great difficulties which was occurring within our training sector was that many of our teachers had gone through school and college and then back into the classroom themselves, without having any real knowledge of industry. They were preparing people for a world of work which had changed quite dramatically in the last 10 or 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is borne out more dramatically when one recognises that the average age of primary school teachers in Australia is somewhere between 45 and 50. One would have to say that the kinds of experiences which they have had in terms of school and schooling, and a notion of work and the work place, are somewhat different from those which occur now in 1992. Indeed, the children they are teaching will be in the work force after the year 2000. It is stated, and research shows, that over 70 per cent of the jobs that will be available in the year 2010 have yet to be discovered; so an ageing work force in our school system is simply unable to meet those kinds of changing needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also provides an opportunity for teachers to go into the work force. I for one am very pleased to see that&mdash;as someone who has also spent 20 years in the classroom. I think it is particularly important that teachers understand very clearly the kind of work force and the kinds of demands that are currently being made on their young charges, and that they have an opportunity to experience the full range and the full sets of experiences, because, let us face it, one of the few things about which we can now be certain in terms of the work force is change. The days of people simply having one job, doing the same task year in and year out, day in and day out for 50 years are gone forever. I think many of us would welcome that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us, of course, also welcome the up-skilling of our work force. Indeed, members of the Opposition have disclaimed the use of the training guarantee levy for people pursuing qualifications overseas, or some kind of training and training courses overseas. While I for one certainly think that our first responsibility must always be Australia and Australians, there are many factors in the overseas experience from which we can learn. The Scandinavian countries and Germany have shown us that, in terms of educating their work force and creating a system and an environment in which the work force in fact accepts that it must be skilled, it must continue to be skilled and must also participate and should participate in the life of the company in which it works, and that is a very important facet for all of us to understand. One would have thought that the motives for a profit would drive industry to demand a better and more skilled and productive work force. If they are the kinds of values which can be explored and gathered, garnished from overseas, then that is something that the training guarantee levy could and should be applied to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I also say that I think the Small Business Association, certainly in Queensland and throughout Australia, has seen training methods, business methods and processes as one of the reasons for the enormous demise of small business in Australia. Indeed, right in the boom times of the 1980s in Queensland, six out of seven small businesses were folding within six to seven months. That had nothing to do with the economic downturn; that was in fact in boom times. Those small businesses were unable to operate in a booming economy. One would have to ask why. We know why: because their work force was unskilled. They were unskilled, as either managers or people who were able to work in any sort of operation which enabled them to operate in what was a booming economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at that; we have to address that. As I said, the issue has been addressed by a whole range of people, and the training guarantee levy is the answer. Its flexibility and its ability to be used in a whole range of ways means that it is an opportunity for industry to up-skill its work force in a way which it finds most suitable. If that means buying in trainers, if it means participating in a range of group schemes, if it means buying and developing some of its own facilities, this is the way it should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what is happening is, as one of the members of the Opposition suggests, that people are running out and simply spending their money willy-nilly on a whole range of packages which are inappropriate to them as an industry, that says considerably more about the managers of industry than about the training guarantee levy. I am appalled, horrified and totally dismayed that managers and people who purport to be leaders in our community could simply go out and fling money around in some sort of revengeful and spiteful act against the training guarantee levy rather than look at it as a real opportunity to develop skills within their work force, which will bring them profits. One has to wonder about the kind of motivation and the kind of nonsense that is being expounded by some members of the Opposition as to the kind of apparent behaviour within industry because of the training guarantee levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that I have seen some very superb examples of the way in which people have creatively used the training guarantee levy. I have seen examples right through from providing very small appropriate courses on the shop floor to developing literacy skills for people for the first time in their lives. I have seen the development of team approaches so that the ways in which people can become multi-skilled are developed and worked upon. I have also seen the top end of the scale, at which a number of companies have built their own community college to develop a range of skills across their whole industry. So, indeed, industry does, will and can respond to the demands of the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, most of industry seemed unwilling or unable to move down the training path. So the Government needed to introduce the training guarantee levy to provide a stimulus for training and to recognise and establish on the agenda once and for all that training must be, will be and has to be a central issue for government, industry and unions if we are going to take Australia and the Australian work force into the twenty-first century and, by doing so, ensure a healthy growth in profits. Of course, with a healthy growth in profits comes an expansion in jobs. The training guarantee levy is central to that issue. It is absolutely integral that industry see it as such, seize the opportunity and develop a skilled Australia that will take us all into the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill 1992, I must refer to some of the comments that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) has made. The boom in small business during the 1980s came about because people were out there desperately trying to employ people. But what happened was that, under the Hawke Government of that time, small business was told that interest rates would be coming down in 1984 and again, in 1987, Mr Hawke said before the election campaign that interest rates would be coming down. Of course, this was wrecking small businesses on a daily basis. The Government never gave an opportunity to many small businesses to get off the ground and keep going up. They were kept on the ground because the Government kept on upping the ante on interest rates until they reached the level of 18 1/2 per cent and then up to 24 1/2 per cent in the end for those that were struggling. The harder they struggled, the higher the interest rates went.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government did create a change; it had got a change off the ground. But the outcome of the change is that some 900,000 people are now out of work. In 1973, there were some 3,000 people who were long term unemployed. Only recently we saw a headline that says that we now have 311,000 people who are long term unemployed. So I say to the honourable member for Forde that, yes, there has been a change. We now have the lowest inflation, which was caused by the recession that we `had to have'; we have the lowest number of days lost at work in January, caused by the recession we `had to have'; we have the deepest recession for 60 years; and we still have high interest rates compared with those of our international competitors. </PARA>

That was put to a committee, but I notice that the Government has not taken up or addressed that issue in this Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that this legislation is another heavy hand of government that is entering into the business places. It is exactly the same as the superannuation levy. It is the Government's whole approach of entering into the administration of businesses right across Australia. What the Government is saying is, `We want the opportunity to have a share of your profit to direct it to wherever we want it to go'. It is not satisfied with high taxation rates; it actually wants to enter in. The Government is going to find problems all the way through this, and further amendments will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One provision will allow an employer to include work experience for students and teachers in eligible training programs, and others make some less important technical amendments and clarifications. In regard to teachers moving out, there have been some very successful exercises of teachers moving out of their workplace, as was explained by the honourable member for Forde, because they had been to primary, secondary and tertiary education and then moved back into the education industry, if I can call it that. Did the honourable member for Forde say they had no worthwhile experience or did she say they had no real experience of life and, therefore, were inadequately equipped to train the students of Australia for the workplace environment that they are heading into?  I think they were her exact words, but I could be corrected. She said, `We have a work force in our teaching community in Australia that is inadequately equipped to train the young people of today who have to go in to face this workplace where some 40 per cent of them are unemployed'. Through this no answers are given as to how that might be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some teachers who have actually moved into industry and been very successful in the education programs that they have introduced into companies, and then have applied for leave of absence for one year and actually not gone back into the education industry. They found out that there was another world out there; there was a world for them to tap. In my opinion, we have actually let our teachers down to a great degree in Australia over the last 10 years. On a popularity rating, I think they come somewhere down near politicians&mdash;which is very unfair on them, I am sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having some experience with people who have come to my business for work experience, I believe that what the Labor Government has missed in this Bill is that people have been training young people for a long time in businesses throughout Australia. It is not the way the Government would like them trained. There are people who&mdash;I talk about individual application to work&mdash;come from school into businesses for a two-week period or even a week and get a bit of vision about where they might like to be when they enter the work force. Some come into our retail establishments and may decide that they are not particularly keen on being in the retail industry. Therefore, that gives them an impetus and a vision to go on to either higher education or other things. It gives them a little snippet of what the world is like when they have to actually pay for something out of the profits and they have to make a contribution on a daily basis to the operation of that business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not support this Bill because it is a further impost on business. The training and the administration that is tied up with it make it like the superannuation levy legislation which the Government has introduced. It is very similar to the WorkCare program in Victoria, which is another impost on business; and it is very similar to the payroll tax we pay, which is a tax on people who want to work and a tax on people who want to increase the size of their work force. But they do not increase their work force, and there are a number of reasons why they do not do that. Land tax is another impost on business which is affecting Victoria particularly badly at the moment. There is also the bank accounts debit tax and the high tax on employees, which reduces the ability of businesses to reinvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think the comments of the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) today were the pits. She said, `If you can't spend this money in your own business, then give it away'. I come from the small business sector, and I cannot remember a time, in any of my businesses, when there was extra money to fling around. If there was extra money to fling around, people actually tried to employ somebody from their community; they took the opportunity to employ somebody else and build up the business or reinvest or expand into new lines. The honourable member for Cowan said that, if people cannot spend the money, under the Government's program detailed in this Bill they have the opportunity to turn around and give it to somebody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forde said that businesses should give the money to teaching institutions. The honourable member for Cowan said that there must be some set-up which could be fitted into the Act whereby people could give their profits away. What a great idea! That is terrific. The Government comes in and tells a business how it will spend its money. This must mean that every business will be guaranteed a certain profit each year. Will businesses be guaranteed certain profits each year because of all of these levies and imposts?

Honourable members should remember that hospitals have administrative areas and they have reporting procedures in many areas. But this levy was described as `challenging'. The chief executive officer to whom I spoke was being very careful with his words because he knew I would come into this House and quote what he had said. So he used the word `challenging'. But it sounded tongue in cheek when he said `challenging'. In other words, it is a huge effort for that hospital to report on the training it gives its staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is reflected through all of the hospitals in my electorate and, I dare say, those in the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary at the table. I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary ring the hospitals in his electorate and ask them how they are affected by this Bill. He will then find that, perhaps because of the imposition of the training guarantee, they have actually reduced the amount of training they are doing as well. There are hospitals which have not been doing any training to this time, and they are now having great difficulty conforming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worst of all, in Victoria businesses can say, `Well, this will come out of the profits, so we will make 1 1/2 per cent less profit this year'.

We should remember that businesses have to make some dough before they can pay all of these things; they have to make some dough in the first place or they are out the back door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kirner State Government in Victoria said to the hospitals, `Look, you are going to have to take this money for training out of existing resources because, even though we agree with what the Federal Government is doing, we are not prepared to pay for it'. So it gets the chance to say,`There is the institution', but it is the institution and the local people who raise extra funds to keep these institutions going&mdash;such as the Westernport Hospital and the Kooweerup Potato Festival Committee, which had a great year this year and will raise another $30,000 for the hospital&mdash;who will actually pay the impost of 1 1/2 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is part of it. The Government fails to understand that it is its continued imposts time after time which contribute to this situation. The Government has been given a plan that we have called Fightback which could begin to address these matters. I do not know why the Government has not had the strength and the intestinal fortitude to actually look at the Fightback package prepared by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and fully implement the guts of it. At least it returns the opportunities for jobs. In 24 months, a staggering 8,673 people in my electorate of Corinella have lost their jobs. Those people have names like John, Robin, Peter and Bill. There are dads who do not have jobs and there are children who do not have jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my next point. This week in the newspaper Geoffrey Barker talked about the difficulties that have been faced by the Los Angeles community recently and the absolute tragedy that has occurred. He went on to talk about Australia in a similar context. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The black and hispanic mobs who went on a four-day spree of killing, beating, burning and looting provided a chilling glimpse of the fury and the destructive power of deprived and alienated underclasses in prosperous liberal societies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Groups who feel marginalised, deprived of justice, employment, education and opportunity are about as stable as nitro-glycerine.

<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the persistence of high levels of long-term unemployment&mdash;especially among young people&mdash;is creating a deprived, alienated and potentially destructive underclass in Australia.

<PARA>then, to be honest, he continued&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or Opposition parties.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia may not have the witches' brew of racial and social unrest that forced President Bush to send the US army to restore order to Los Angeles last week, but there is evidence of increasing personal despair and declining social cohesion as job prospects continue to be bleak and uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the trend line in the Dandenong area. We have not hit the bottom. I report to the Parliament that the increase continues. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the evidence is the increasing incidence of serious assault and theft charges against young people. The causal connection between unemployment and crime is not clear, but there seems little doubt in the minds of criminologists and youth workers that there has been a sharp increase in the number of unemployed young people who feel marginalised and who are in furious . . . despair about their future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not Australia is creating a lost generation of the 1990s remains to be seen, but a sub-culture of young, unqualified and unemployed Australians is increasingly visible and voluble, especially in Australia's hard-hit, old industrial regions.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Less visible, but no less desperate, are the vast numbers of qualified young people who are also locked out of the employment that would give them the experience and confidence on which to build the careers for which they trained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the youth unemployment rate is close to 40 per cent . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Is that the unemployment rate we had to have, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, who is at the table? Is 40 per cent, four out of 10, of our young people the unemployment rate we have to have in Australia? Is that our future? In the One Nation statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), did it not say that continued unemployment is expected through to the year 2000 at current levels? Does that mean that he is not going to address the problem that we face as a nation? I remember back a short time ago when there was a riot of young people in the city of Frankston one Saturday night. It was some years ago. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago the Labor Party, just back in office, was acutely sensitive to the personal and social costs of the unemployment generated by Fraser Government policies. Writing in the 1983 edition of `Labor Essays', Ralph Willis, now Minister for Finance, and John Langmore, MP, observed: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">". . . unemployment is an important contributing factor to symptoms of social disruption, such as increasing crime, vandalism, mental and physical illness, wife- and child-bashing, marital breakdown, drug addiction, homelessness, prostitution and suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . .

<PARA>I say to the Parliamentary Secretary: if this is this Government's form of social justice, it is a crime. We have given the Government an opportunity under Fightback to implement changes that can put a halt to the decline in employment in Australia. Previous Prime Minister Hawke, before those opposite exited him recently, said that he created 1.6 million jobs with all the imposts that were on this Government at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. I note that the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) invited me to comment on some of his contributions. I mention my local hospital, Mount Druitt Hospital. I was chairman of the committee that pushed locally for some years to get the hospital. I was pleased to serve with Bishop Pat Murphy, with him as chairman and me as deputy chairman, for some years on the board. A lack of religious qualifications precluded me from aspiring to be chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member wants to know what the real problem is at Mount Druitt Hospital, frankly it is that the State Government has closed so many beds. We are down to 160 operating beds, which is the lowest level that we have had for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being made to choose between having an orthopaedic service and a gynaecological service at the hospital. It is an awful choice for a community to be forced to make by a government determined to render the hospital capable of not optimising its services to the community. As someone who has always vigorously and publicly supported the hospital, I am concerned about the issue of care and personal attention that staff members provide to casualty and to patients. In my view, it has dropped. I think that is all the more regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that Oppositions always do, as this Opposition does with the training levy Bill, is to say, firstly, that Fightback solves everything for small business. Of course, the Opposition does not tell small business that it will not be eligible to benefit from payroll tax abolition under Fightback&mdash;that is an exclusive preserve of medium and large business. Small business will have extra administrative costs and, at the end of the day, will be paying a higher company tax rate. In fact, if anyone is the loser out of Fightback, it is small business. I would have thought that the Opposition, at least in terms of `Flexiback', as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is calling it, would be trying to ease the burden that small business will so obviously bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella invited me to comment on youth unemployment. In my electorate, I have a particular problem. For statistical reasons, the Australian Bureau of Statistics aggregates the Blacktown local government area with Baulkham Hills. The youth unemployment rate provided by the Bureau&mdash;which I am happy to concede is unacceptably high&mdash;is about 28.8 per cent. I am concerned about that, but the difficulty for me is that Baulkham Hills and Blacktown are aggregated for statistical purposes. The general unemployment rate for Blacktown, which we are able to disaggregate, is about 11 per cent; for Baulkham Hills, it is 2.5 per cent. Unfortunately, I think the clear implication from that is that the 28.8 per cent figure is very badly understated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella said that, in his electorate, he had 40 per cent youth unemployment. In no way do I wish to say that is an acceptable figure, but I think he needs to explain how that figure was derived. It was not derived from the percentage of all young people in his electorate; that is, if there were 1,000 young people in his electorate, 400 of them were unemployed. The figure excludes those who are at school, at TAFE, or at university. The net figure that is used includes those people who are either in the work force or unemployed. That is why that figure is much higher. If it were taken over the whole youth population, the figure would be much lower. Having said that, I wish in no way to condone the existing level of youth unemployment. Indeed, it is a real concern of mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that, in this area of industrial relations cum training cum vocational training, we could arrive at some bipartisan approach. In fact, I think that it is dramatically important that we do. But I am unable to observe that that will be the case. I think that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is wrong in suggesting that we will reach agreement on these issues. In fact, I think that it will be a flashpoint for the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations is clearly an area where we have some very fundamental differences. The Opposition seemed to argue the point of golden dialogue, that is, that the only valid form of dialogue is that which can exist between the employer and the employee. Any other form of dialogue is inappropriate, not wanted and should be disdained. It does not address the issue. The Opposition wants to smash the unions, but it says, `Well, look, we are not against unions. It will be on a voluntary basis and they will have to offer services'. It knows full well that its policies will fragment the trade union movement and will render them less able to demonstrate the very point that it says they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is that the Opposition really sees economic success in Australia as being through coolie wages. It believes that if wages can be lowered enough, we will have a booming economy. That is so unrealistic. It is not the way to go. This Government is saying that we have profound confidence in the ability of Australian men and women in the work force and those about to join the work force to provide the skill base to trade our way out of our current situation. In fact, we are doing it. That has to be contrasted with the approach of the Opposition, whose only retort is golden dialogue and coolie wages. I think that it is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that I would like to raise, because it is analogous with the training levy, is superannuation. The Opposition does not talk about its record when it was in government. Maybe it is unfair, so many years later, to keep raising that, but the reality is that the people who had superannuation coverage under the Opposition were public servants and the highest level people in private enterprise&mdash;middle management and above&mdash;and no-one else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am responding to the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong, so I wanted to make that point. I think that, genuinely, there ought to be a legitimate debate about national savings which ties in here. Let me point to what happens in Singapore on the issue of superannuation and savings. It has a scheme where the employer contributes&mdash;this is in its original form&mdash;25 per cent and the employee contributes 25 per cent. This is a massive amount, which has fuelled Singapore's economy. Here we are trying to say that it is all right for all sections of the community to aspire to a degree of security in their old age and, incidentally, help the national economy, yet this is opposed bitterly by those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not think that to date the important place that award restructuring takes has been mentioned in the debate on vocational training. If there was one catalyst for change in thinking, it was award restructuring. In the metal trades industry the number of separate awards was reduced from about 300 to 10 and a whole new classification system was devised with the cooperation of the trade union movement and the employers, who sat down and worked through it; there are now about 10 different classifications. If we want to point to a catalyst in the change of thinking, let us put up front award restructuring; let us congratulate the employers and associations involved in it, and let us congratulate the trade unions for doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill, once again we have this approach by the Opposition. Incidentally, I was amused when the honourable member for Corinella referred to the contribution of the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), who said, `Well, if they can't spend it, they ought to get out'. His point was that he would try to employ someone else. It is interesting that the Opposition never runs the argument that the training provided in all forms of business enterprises, from small to large, is already exceeding OECD averages or it excludes some other acceptable figure or it says that we ought to be complacent and move on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what distinguishes us, I suppose. The Opposition sees it as an intrusion into business. We see it in terms of economic restructuring with employees being perhaps the most valuable ingredients and we see their level of skill, whether it is in a service industry providing service like retailing or in a very highly technical industry, as being absolutely critical. We will move as we have in the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill to say to business that this is not acceptable and that it should get levels of expenditure on training up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that I am still in the Parliament when we come to the day when we say that Australian business and employees have really grabbed the nub of this issue; that they have moved on so far that they are not only convinced of the benefits of it but also practising it; and that there is no need for this legislation. But, unfortunately, there is. Just as there was need for the superannuation legislation, there is a need for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) made a very interesting contribution in the area of vocational training. I wanted to spend a little time, by and large, agreeing with him. In my own electorate, I believe that our education system fails students. If I have been associated with two things in this Parliament in relation to education they have been the campaign for the University of Western Sydney and the issue of senior high schools. It is an absolute tragedy that New South Wales is the only State with one senior high school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A senior high school is of benefit because we have low retention, notwithstanding the increased goals that are articulated about retention&mdash;and we have movement there&mdash;but it is unacceptably below the national average. Senior high schools allow us to aggregate the number of students in year 11 and 12, and to offer a wider choice in terms of curriculum. Most important of all, we are able to treat these young adults as young adults. I cannot emphasise how important that is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been bitterly opposed by conservative elements in the community, the most notable probably being the Australian Teachers Federation. But there are many examples Australia-wide. Whether we go to Tasmania&mdash;it is established as a point of failure for the system, which in reality it is not&mdash;the ACT, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Victoria or Queensland, senior high schools exist. By and large, the senior high schools tend to be orphans within the administration under which they are placed, but they succeed and perform well. Students like going to them and, apparently, that is the biggest sin that the schools have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report is the first public report. Whilst Finn acknowledged the role of senior high schools, Carmichael is unequivocally in support of them. So they are an important feature in his program of reform. But this program of reform that Carmichael is advocating for us&mdash;it touches on this Bill because of the earlier Finn report&mdash;is this, and it is very simple: a majority of Australian young people do not aspire to go on to university or tertiary education at that stage in their lives. Yet education Ministers, departments and commissions throughout Australia have this absurd proposition that in years 11 and 12 these students should be locked into a curriculum which is frankly not meeting their needs and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anyone suggest that we are going to develop a less rigorous curriculum or testing regime for those majority of young Australians who seek to enter the world of work at the earliest opportunity, that is not the case. But we have to bite the bullet in what we offer them. We just cannot look at one issue in isolation. For my part, I cannot just look at senior high schools as the answer. We cannot just look at the issue of curriculums in years 11 and 12 and open up the opportunities to go on to TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the trade union movement and the Labor Party, I acknowledge a most difficult issue; that is, youth wages. Unpopular as it may be, I advance the thought that I do not believe that we have come to grips with it. But we have the potential to come to grips with it on the advice of the recent reports, in particular the Carmichael report, which suggests that we need to merge traineeships and apprenticeships. It also suggests that we need to look further than the concept whereby we go to school and when we leave it we go to work and a little training is involved. The issue of entry level training is just that; one goes into further training where there is work involved. It is a revolution in thinking. It is contrary to our British way of looking at things, but it is quite comfortable with Europeans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any report that has the potential to alter the outcomes for young people in my electorate and, I would say, in Western Sydney, it is the Carmichael report. I believe that all honourable members ought to be vigilant in terms of this vocational and educational revolution to ensure that there is full support for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not going to be cheap to implement. Something like $1.2 billion of additional Commonwealth expenditure will be required up until 1998. I say to State Ministers for education that for once in our lives let us not argue about territory and administration but let us focus on who will benefit and whom we are seeking to serve, and let us come to an agreement about issues such as the Commonwealth offer in relation to TAFE. Let us get behind the Carmichael report and look at a brave new world in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not meet the challenges presented in trying to cater for the needs of the majority of young Australians, we are going to permanently condemn whole rafts of them. Young Australians will not just be three-year long term unemployed but generationally unemployed. We will have no hope whatsoever of breaking poverty cycles, of providing hope and opportunity&mdash;career and educational&mdash;for so many young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that I support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill and its openings in relation to some of the recommendations of the Finn committee. Employers can get benefits by allowing a wider range of participation, whether it be work experience or participation by teachers in the work environment. I strongly endorse that. I also strongly endorse the idea that where industries fail to live up to our expectation, whether they are big or small or middle, there is a legitimate role for the Government to say that we want every Australian in the work force skilled, trained up, performing better, and more productive. I do not see it as an intrusion into business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I wait for the day when I can come into the House and say how magnificent the performance has been, and that this bit of legislation is no longer necessary because all businesses recognise the worth of their employees and are spending far above what is expected in terms of training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard to speak to the very narrow aspects of this Bill without expressing views on the whole concept of this legislation. I am reasonably grateful to the previous speaker, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price), because he touched on a couple of issues that I already have written down, including youth wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue concerns the mechanisms by which we achieve vocational training within Australia. The simple fact is that the Opposition has the view that this sort of levy is not the appropriate means of achieving vocational training. I think the evidence that that is so is now legion. It always comes back to one simple situation: the total lack of understanding of how people achieve vocational skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded that the father of the present honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) once said at about the time of his retirement from parliament that when he entered the Labor Party it consisted of the cream of the working class and, by the time he left it, it had the dregs of the middle class. Of course, in many cases that happens to be the dregs of academia&mdash;those who aspired to be engineers but ended up union officials in the engineering union, not being smart enough to pass their exams. There is the case of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). He is a good indication of that fact, having taken nine years to get an economics degree and having to be shunted into a trade union between parliamentary appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that these people have not had the experience of operating a business as the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) and I have. Therefore, they come to this Parliament with the idea that as long as someone sits down behind a desk, that person will learn vocational skills. For the information of the Parliament, I have to say that, to his credit, the previous speaker touched on this. But the simple fact is that I do not care what sort of academic achievements people have; they start to learn vocational skills when they go to work. They can have the most wonderful degrees, such as a masters degree or a PhD, but when they get out in the workplace it suddenly comes as a dreadful shock to find how they will have to operate and what they need to understand. Certainly, that background of academic training will be of assistance, but they will learn their vocational skills in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary indicated, if high levels of academic training are necessary for people to achieve in their chosen workplace&mdash;and they certainly are if people aspire to a science vocation or many other vocations&mdash;certainly they have to go as high as possible with academic training. But in so many cases the way people earn their living does not require that level of academic training and, in fact, in terms of their achieving the skills they need, it is a downright problem; it is a roadblock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best accepted rules of learning is that the older one gets, the harder it is to learn. A child learns a language in two or three years; but try learning a second language at 45, or anything else for that matter. Why do we say to young people that they cannot be allowed to learn to do a day's work when they are 12 or 13 and that they have to continue to be trained academically&mdash;often in subjects that are totally useless and do not even extend their mental capacity? I think that is what the previous speaker was touching on in his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been an advocate of this all my life. Today I completed a letter to a school in my electorate where the fishing industry is dominant. I asked whether that school would consider teaching skills that are necessary in the fishing industry, just as a couple of other schools in Western Australia are teaching kids air-training skills and to fly aeroplanes, as well as covering a lot of the academic aspects of that, whilst they are 12 and 13 years old. Why are schools not doing that for the fishing industry? I am concerned that I will receive a reply, `The local TAFE does it already'. In my letter I asked: why does someone have to wait to turn 17 or 18 to be taught how to get a job?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give a practical example of that. I was in that fishing area just after Easter. I had the fortune to go out on a crayfishing boat. Because it was school holidays there was an 11-year-old boy on board. He came from a relative's family and he was just there for a holiday, but he did not have any previous experience. He was given the opportunity to steer the boat. It happened to be a jet boat. Those boats are harder to steer than those with a rudder and a keel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kid was having some difficulty and was told to follow the compass. He had no idea of how to use the compass, and at one stage we did a full circle. The fisherman then took control of him and explained what he had to do to follow the compass, and within five minutes that kid could keep that boat straight. He had learnt a fundamental principle of the vocation of fishing in five minutes. How long would he have taken to learn it back at school?  He would have still driven the boat in a circle when he first got in. He would have said that the compass does this and does that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the Government has got it wrong. How does it measure this expenditure? Basically it has to be external. Business has been training staff for decades, for centuries. It just has not kept records of that independent expenditure. In certain areas&mdash;and I have experience in trucking and earth moving&mdash;a lot of it was in wrecked equipment as people learnt. There is the guy who joined the local authority, got the opportunity to drive the front-end loader and over time progressed to driving a grader, which was considered the top of that particular tree. The simple fact is that that happened; it happened in local government, it happened everywhere. Suddenly someone says, `We will send them to school and teach them all about that'. I bet we do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the House something else that is going on and how this expenditure is being justified. I have been a guest speaker on approved programs. With due respect, what does the Government think I taught young people about vocational skills? I was no doubt highly entertaining after lunch. I took note of some the other speakers, some of whom were telling them how to organise their tax affairs to pay less money. Is that what the Government believes is the idea behind this training? It is creating junkets in certain sectors. It is a joke. So what is the Government achieving? Nothing! People were better off before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary referred to youth wages. In my electorate I had somewhere between 20 and 50 young apprentices out of work; I cannot be certain of the number. A group of them contacted me and said, `We are out of work because we were apprenticed to small building industry businesses. We want to go back and complete the last year of our indentures so we can become tradesmen and then we will take our chances in the world. We want to do that for nothing. We know our bosses cannot afford to pay us, but let us please complete our indentures'. What did the protectors of those young men, those union bureaucrats, say? `No, you cannot do it'. In response, to some degree the State Government of Western Australia is now picking some of those kids up and paying them at the taxpayers' expense so that they can qualify before their time runs out. Remember that under an apprenticeship they cannot go back when they are ready. What sort of training is that? Why is it that we prevent young people from employment by overpricing them in the market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my recollection, there was a time in the hotel industry when we could not apprentice a chef and we were constantly stuck with drunks and no-hopers, particularly in rural areas, because we could not get people who had made a vocation of it. I was desperate for the day I could train some young people in my district to become chefs. Apprenticeships were formally introduced. I think the matter was overlooked by the union at the time, and the first year's wage was $18 a week. I said to my wife, `We do not need an apprentice to help us work, but we should employ one'. We had the qualified chefs in our business to teach them, and teach them well. We took one on and the next year we took another one on. Suddenly the union woke up, made an application to the industrial commission and got those first-year wages lifted to $50 or $60 a week. Of course, it progressed until in the final year I was paying some hundreds of dollars for people whom I did not need to run my business but whom I was prepared to train. We never employed another one. We could not afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to my wife, `At $18 a week for the first year and $50 a week for the next year and so on, what does it matter? Let us get some kids trained'. I might add that those two young men who went through that process are both still employed as qualified chefs and are highly regarded in the business. That is training. Business will do it if it is given half a chance; but taking another 1 1/2 per cent off the payrolls is ridiculous. These are the issues that have to be understood by the Government. This is what annoys me; it is a waste of money. Much of it is being wasted in that way. There are better ways to achieve training. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In view of the bipartisan support for Australian involvement in the Cambodian peace process, I ask the Prime Minister what the Government's assessment is of recent reports about significant Khmer Rouge military activity in Cambodia and its implications for the safety of Australian troops. I also refer the Prime Minister to the United Nations plan to have a total peacekeeping force of 15,900 troops on the ground in Cambodia, and the fact that there are currently only 4,000 in place. When does the Government expect the other 12,000 peacekeeping troops will arrive in Cambodia to give additional support to the Australian and other contingents of the UN force? Finally, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will be making any statement to this House about the 30 additional Australian Defence Force personnel who will be sent to Cambodia, as announced this week by Senator Ray.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been disturbances and renewed violence by the Khmer Rouge in Kampong Thom province, as there were a few weeks ago. The Government takes these seriously because of their implications for the peacekeeping effort. But there is no suggestion at this stage that the UN's general peacekeeping effort in Cambodia will be significantly affected by these occasional outbreaks and violations. The fact is that forces are being deployed, and the quicker the UN force is deployed the better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 30 troops which were announced as additions by Australia in the course of this week are for a movement control group which will assist in getting into place more quickly the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces. Our extra 30 is actually about facilitating the more immediate and quicker placement of UN peacekeeping forces in Cambodia generally. The task of getting that deployment into place remains a large and difficult one, and the quicker the better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the relationship between Australia's low inflation environment and the reduction in interest rates announced today?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2479" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to be made about the relationship between inflation and interest rates is that the reduction in interest rates announced today represents an inflation dividend, that is, passing on the benefits of low inflation to the Australian community as a whole, whether they be home buyers, businesses borrowing money, or simply those in the community who will be the eventual and continuing beneficiaries of low inflation in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are entitled to be very pleased with the way in which there has been such a speedy transformation of the low inflation outcome for the March quarter into interest rates as a result of the decision announced today. It is also worth bearing in mind that not only does this interest rate cut mean cheaper finance now; it will also help to achieve a continuing low inflation outcome in the future. We can now not only look forward to an inflation outcome for the 1991-92 financial year below 2 per cent, but also we can anticipate an inflation outcome for this calendar year of below 2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has led to a reduction in the official forecast for inflation for the 1992-93 year, and we cannot emphasise enough how important it is that inflationary expectations continue their downward trend. As I say, as the Reserve Bank points out in its announcement today, the fact that interest rates are coming down now, the fact that those interest rates will be reflected in lower mortgage interest rates and, therefore, lower mortgage payments during the current quarter, and of course the fact that the Medicare co-payment abolition will also be reflected in the current quarter means that we can expect another low quarter as far as the CPI is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, the other point is of course that this inflation record, this inflation progress, has important implications for our wages outcome because of the agreement that we have with the ACTU to ensure that we continue to lock in those low inflation results through our wages policy. I cannot emphasise enough what an enormous threat, what enormous damage, is posed to a continuing low level of inflation through the reckless behaviour of the Opposition in the Senate as far as the superannuation guarantee levy is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be recognised that the superannuation arrangements and the superannuation guarantee levy which fortifies those arrangements are an integral part of wages policy, the maintenance of wage restraint and, therefore, the achievement of low inflation now and into the future. We have seen once again the ambiguity of the Opposition on this question of interest rates. It has opposed almost every interest rate cut that has occurred in the last couple of years. Even now, it was suggesting this morning that this reduction today has been brought about as a result of some political pressure being applied to the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again we see an Opposition unsure of itself, totally adrift as far as policy is concerned, with this astonishing admission by the Leader of the Opposition: when he was asked, `Do you think the one per cent rate fall is responsible?', he said, `Well, we leave those judgments, quite frankly, to the authorities'. In other words, he has not got a clue about monetary policy. He has not got a clue about how we go&mdash;</PARA>

I ask the Prime Minister: does he have an agreement with Bill Kelty of the ACTU to discount wage increases for the impact of the superannuation guarantee levy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation was always part of an agreement with the ACTU that it would be part of what would otherwise be cash settlements paid as savings. That has always been the position. The fact that I can stand and say that just indicates the depth of understanding and associations enjoyed by the Government in the labour market in contradistinction to that of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we see from the Opposition is what we saw again today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, with the honourable member for Bennelong talking about detonating the big bangs. As if he did not detonate a big enough bang in 1979-80. That bang dislocated Australian inflation again and put us up to the highest interest rates in our history, with cash rates of over 22 per cent. As I said yesterday, the Opposition is itching to revisit the scene of the crime to have a second go, to try to do it twice; that is, to try to wreck the inflation rate on two occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much was made yesterday of the Treasury's offering the very simple view that if there is a net addition to wages, this will have an impact on costs, activity and, finally, employment. The Treasury itself indicated that this was not a reasonable assumption on the part of Opposition senators who were putting the questions; it would not be an addition but, rather, a substitution for wages and salaries which would otherwise be paid as cash. That is the point I made yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has actually secured the agreement of the organised work force to put away 10 to 12 per cent of its income as savings for this country so that as we move through the middle to late 1990s, a difficult era for savings worldwide, Australia will not be out in international markets looking for savings and, at the same time, finding its budgets knocked about around the turn of the century and beyond as the demographics of Australia change.

My Department will be closely monitoring the effects on the lowest income earners of restructured account charges which have been introduced by one institution since my meeting with the banks. While the age pensioners with savings in deeming accounts will be exempt from this bank's charges, those on low income benefits and allowances are being made to pay more through higher charges levied on the smallest account holders. I am concerned by that decision, because it may well have the effect of adding to the financial disadvantages in the community of those already most financially disadvantaged.

It would do this, firstly, by the addition of 5 to 7 percentage points to inflation coming from a goods and services tax, a consumption tax, and, secondly, by promising to detonate a big bang industrial relations strategy, as the caption in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says.

The place was a wipe-out for nearly a decade. It is now showing some signs of lifting. So what! After eight or 10 years, it is about time. Just simple human pity would require us all to hope that the economy lifts over there. But the notion that it is lifting on the basis of industrial contracts legislation introduced six months ago is the greatest distortion that we have ever heard.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that on 9 March 1992 the South Australian Government told the Senate Standing Committee on Superannuation that South Australia could not afford the super levy? Is it also a fact that the South Australian Premier, Mr Bannon, has lobbied the Federal Government for an exemption from the levy because the South Australian Government cannot deliver the wage cuts necessary to offset the levy and avert job losses? Perhaps the Prime Minister can explain to the House why the Premier of South Australia is wrong and how South Australia will achieve the wage cuts necessary in order to avoid those job losses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasury, in response to questions in an Estimates committee, has tried to respond frankly to questions put by many Opposition senators. What the Treasury was in fact responding to was a partial quotation from Senator Alston of one of the many documents that were tabled in here some time ago. This is what the Treasury was saying in its document, which Senator Alston quoted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested that 70000 jobs will be lost due to the introduction of the government's superannuation scheme. This assumes that the proposed superannuation increase is a net increase in real unit labour costs. On this assumption, our modelling indicates considerably less than 70000 increase in the number unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact this was a partial quotation. Had Senator Alston bothered to read the next sentence, he would have read the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we consider that there will be some trade-off between average weekly earnings and superannuation increases with possibly no net impact on real unit labour costs.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition has this totally ambiguous position as far as Treasury is concerned. If the Treasury says anything which is even mildly critical of the Opposition, of course it is disparaged by the Opposition, traduced by the Opposition, accused of being the running dogs of some political organisation, whatever it is, and of dragging down this institution which is there to advise the government and on occasions to advise the Senate as well. Then, of course, if the Treasury says something which is partially favourable to a position that the Opposition is putting, those opposite will distort it in order to make it more favourable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me go on and indicate what the Treasury actually thinks about this. Its key point is set out in an answer to a question by Senator Alston in the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury does not believe that it is appropriate to assume that the SGL would lead to a permanent increase in real unit labour costs. Accordingly, estimates of the possible employment consequences of applying such an assumption are likely to prove misleading.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Leader of the Opposition has been the willing architect of this misleading behaviour. He is the one who deliberately decided to distort what was an attempt to provide a frank answer to Senator Alston. Treasury goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treasury considers that the employment effects will be considerably less than suggested on the higher real unit labour cost assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA>But let me make a final point about what the Treasury's work means. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outlook for employment set out in the One Nation statement fully reflected the introduction of the SGL. In 1992-93, employment is expected to increase by 2 1/4 per cent and the unemployment rate to fall to around 9 1/2 per cent in mid 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>This has nothing to do with a loss of jobs. It has to do with the sensible conduct of wages policy in the way in which the Prime Minister has outlined. I think it is pretty appalling to have members opposite sitting in positions which will reward them with very generous superannuation packages upon their retirement&mdash;superannuation packages which will be contributed to by the Government to the tune of in excess of 20 per cent&mdash;trying to deny the extension of some superannuation benefits to workers in Australia who either have no superannuation or very little. Members of the Opposition are sitting there with their 20 per cent contribution from their employer trying to deny employees the opportunity to receive an employer contribution of something like 5 per cent as a result of the SGL coming in on 1 July. This is hypocrisy of the greatest order.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an interesting response from the Brisbane City Council. It estimated that under the proposals the average taxes and rates bill paid by a ratepayer in the Brisbane City Council area could increase by $211.33. One of the alderman in Waverley, in the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition, has estimated that the annual cost for that council would increase by some $760,000. In view of this, I think the Leader of the Opposition has to come clean and state exactly what will or will not be covered by the Opposition's consumption tax proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the new shadow Minister for local government have to say about this? Senator Macdonald has said that there will be savings of hundreds of millions of dollars on services such as gas, electricity and water. It is a great pity that, if there are going to be these huge savings, as designated by Senator Macdonald, he did not get anyone to explain how the Treasury estimates to which he refers could bring that position about. The savings actually need to be passed on to the consumers to reduce the increase in the cost of electricity, which is estimated to rise under the Opposition's proposals by 10.56 per cent, and of gas, which is estimated to rise by 7.67 per cent. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald, unfortunately, has also entered into the error of double counting the figures to make his case look better. So none of the figures that Senator Macdonald has pulled out of the Treasury response, almost at random, will improve the position of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that local government should be increasingly concerned about is that the Opposition suggests that under the proposal it will hack back the financial assistance grants to the order of 5 per cent. This will mean a slashing of funds of some $36m to local government. So why do you not go out to local government and tell them exactly what you are prepared to do?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The business sector is really concerned about the effect that the new superannuation guarantee levy will have on it. The small-business sector today is already reeling under the worst recession this country has experienced in 60 years&mdash;a recession, I might add, brought on by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bankruptcies have increased by 50 per cent over the past 12 months and yet this Government wants to increase that figure further by putting this impost onto small business. Over the period from July 1989, 31,000 small businesses have gone bankrupt. In fact, during the term of this Government a staggering 79,345 small businesses have gone to the wall because of its policies. That does not take account of the number of small businesses that close their doors and just walk away because they cannot make a quid. The Government does not seem to entertain these facts.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me of a joke I heard about 12 months ago. The joke went something like this: how do you get a small business?  The answer in those days was: get a larger one and wait. Today that is stark reality. Not only are large and medium sized businesses scaling down, not only are they losing market share, not only are they not making profit, but also they are going broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This superannuation guarantee levy will be an increase in costs. There are three things that might happen: either the cost of the levy will have to be paid for out of wages; it will flow on to prices; or it will result in the loss of jobs. We need to look at what industry is saying about this, because the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) is not listening. I think the first important thing we should look at is what the Minister's own Small Business Coalition said. In a submission to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins),  Senator Button, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and him, his own Small Business Coalition went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is no doubt aware of the concerns of all business that the superannuation levy guarantee is regarded as a massive deterrent to employment and will, we believe, have the effect of causing significant job losses. . . Any review should consider such possibilities as trading off benefits such as penalty rates and holiday leave loadings for increased  across the board superannuation coverage to which ideally both employers and wage-earners would contribute.</PARA>
<PARA>The Executive Director of VECCI said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The superannuation tax will increase labour costs by up to five per cent with an estimated 60,000 jobs to be lost in the first year of the tax. . . Jobs will go, companies will go to the wall, taxes will rise. . . and companies will hold off from creating new employment to avoid the threshold where additional superannuation commitments have to be met.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Edwards added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be little or no gains from these economic casualties. . . the tax will simply channel funds which would be available for reinvestment in small-to-medium size businesses. . . The upshot will be reduced investment in business and restrictions on job growth.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government has probably introduced this at the worst possible time. The Government is totally out of touch with what the economy is doing and totally out of touch with what this country is doing. I noticed an article about the Australian economy, but more importantly about this Government's handling of the economy, in the Singapore <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Straits Times</EMPHASIS> of 14 January this year. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crisis-hit Australia faces some tough economic decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has reached a crossroads in its battle to repair. . . self-confidence and restore some international prestige to what was, only 20 years ago, a credible middle-ranking economic power. The country's decisions over the next few years will determine the economic well-being of Australians to come.</PARA>
<PARA>So true that is! Why does the Minister not heed the warning? It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After thrashing around for quick-fix solutions for nearly 10 years, Australians have found themselves back at square one&mdash;in a recession. . . The 1980s will undoubtedly go down amongst the most wasteful years in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA>This Minister, this Government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have not learnt the lesson. In contrast, we are proposing to make our business sector internationally competitive. Our policies will make our business sector both domestically and internationally competitive by taking $20 billion worth of taxes off industry. Look at our proposal to scrap $5.8 billion worth of payroll tax. Australian manufacturers have estimated that that will create 175,000 jobs. Yet the Minister is proposing to lose another 100,000 jobs, adding to the just on one million unemployed people in this country. Nationally, one in three young people is unemployed, and that is a national disgrace. In some areas the figure is as high as 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier the Minister criticised our proposal for a reform of the labour market. I draw his attention to an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which reported on these huge benefits that CRA, or Comalco, has achieved in smelters in New Zealand. Do not take my word for it; take its word on what has been happening as a result of the massive reforms. And they are some of the reforms, I might add, that we are proposing. I will quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basic labour productivity had improved spectacularly. The number of man-hours required to produce 1 tonne of aluminium dropped 31 per cent and was still declining.</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike the Minister's so-called productivity gains! What we are proposing is to make our businesses competitive. That will create jobs, unlike the Government's proposals. It went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crude cost of labour had declined 17 per cent per tonne for aluminium produced.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister is about costing jobs in this country. He is about adding labour costs. We are about providing an economic climate so that business, and small business in particular, can succeed and employ people. To get back to the point of what this additional cost will propose for business and small business in this country, I refer to a letter sent to one of my colleagues by David Jones&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will certainly have an impact on small business. It certainly has an impact on jobs. If the Minister does not care about jobs for all Australians, we on this side of the House do care about jobs. We care that the youth of this country leave school and cannot get a job but the Minister does not give a damn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is that the Government cannot see what is happening in the labour market; it does not care what is happening to our youth; it does not care what is happening to this country. We on this side of the House are prepared to get out and argue the benefits of Fightback for this country, for our youth and for our nation. The letter from David Jones, dated 28 April this year, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Jones employs approximately 10,000 staff throughout Australia and, should we incur an additional 2% payroll cost, we will have no alternative but to instruct there be a 2% reduction in employee numbers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>More jobs lost at a time when we cannot afford it. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current recession&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the recession that the Prime Minister said we had to have, and he said that because he did not have the policies; he did not have the vision; and he did not have the determination to set the economic climate in this country so that our industries and our businesses could be competitive&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has had a significant impact on all retailers throughout Australia and to compound our cost of employment by an additional Superannuation Guarantee Levy is not, in my view, in the interest of creating additional employment opportunities and providing a path of recovery from the recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the Minister and his Government are not listening. The National Australia Bank <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quarterly Business Survey </EMPHASIS>surveyed a huge range of business on the impact of the additional 2 per cent superannuation levy. On the question of profitability, the huge majority of respondents in fact responded by saying that they expect profitability to be very poor or poor over the coming months. The huge majority of respondents thought that overheads would fall. They never thought that the Government would increase their overheads by 2 per cent and that that would flow through to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size for small business is 50 to 99 employees. As the Minister may know, that covers the manufacturing small business sector, and he had better read his own report if he does not know what it means. Of the businesses surveyed 52 per cent expect profitability to fall and more than that expect further shedding of labour. In the latest quarter, again another 50 per cent expect that both labour and profitability will continue to fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should go on and see what all industry people think. Not only does the Minister not listen to his own Small Business Coalition but it also concerns us on this side of the House that he does not listen to the business sector. He does not listen to all of those people who are out there trying to make it and trying to employ Australians. The Confederation of Australian Industry states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Guarantee is like a National Wage Increase basically a Guarantee of Increased Unemployment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What does the Minister think this increase in labour costs will do to the CPI? Again, it is just one more nail in the coffin of our manufacturers that are struggling to become competitive under the Government's so-called labour reform that has not happened. The Taxation Institute of Australia states that this levy `could result in tens of thousands of Australians having their wages cut'. The Institute reckons that people will have wage cuts as a result of this. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it would result in unwelcome paper work particularly for small businesses . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It predicted that many employers, because of the current poor economic trading climate, would in fact shed labour. A media release from the Chamber of Commerce in New South Wales states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The levy is a direct cost on employment and acts as a massive disincentive just like any other levy such as Payroll Tax. The superannuation levy will cost small businesses nearly $22 billion over the next 9 years.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: the superannuation levy will cost small business $22 billion over the next nine years&mdash;at a time when it is trying to recover from the worst recession in 60 years. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In calling for the super levy moratorium, Mr Taylor said that employers are already buckling under the weight of the Training Levy, Payroll Tax and current award superannuation payments and this is not conducive to job growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Chamber of Commerce said that the message coming from Treasury really is that the Federal Government is hell-bent on rushing this superannuation levy through at the expense of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we have in this country is that the Minister does not understand what is happening. He does not even take the advice given during the Senate Estimates committee hearing. The Deputy Secretary to the Treasury admitted that there was no evidence to indicate that the superannuation levy will in any way arrest the rising cost of pensions. He also admitted that there was very little evidence to suggest that the superannuation levy will result in any significant increase in national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's whole argument has been blown out of the water; his whole premise has been blown out of the water.

That will flow through to job growth; that will flow through to stability in employment; that will take this additional labour on-cost away.

The Government has not even worked out that its threshold in regard to the 18-year-olds would be very detrimental to youth. What does the Minister think is going to happen when they turn 18?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I enter into this debate on the superannuation guarantee levy. I had to re-read the letter that was given to Mr Speaker about the matter of public importance, because the shadow Minister for small business, housing and Customs, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), during his tirade, was talking about everything else except the superannuation guarantee levy. I must say, it was interesting. The shadow Minister spoke during the cognate debate on the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill and the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill when they were debated last night in the House of Representatives. We agree on one thing in particular, that is, that we all need to encourage Australians to provide adequate retirement benefits for our ageing population. We disagree because the very reason the Government is introducing this superannuation guarantee levy is to make sure that the six million Australians who do not have access to superannuation will have access.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I proceed to rebut what the shadow Minister was talking about, perhaps I should mention a bit of history about the superannuation guarantee levy. This levy came about in 1987 when part of an award agreement was made that 3 per cent of superannuation was to be contributed on behalf of employees in lieu of a wage rise. That is, instead of the employer paying the employee cash, 3 per cent went into superannuation. That was a saving to employers because the 3 per cent superannuation levy did not carry the ongoing on-cost that applied to all wage rises. We have to understand that many businesses in the small-business community complied with that, but many did not. As it was only an award of superannuation, many did not have that impost and had the saving of that 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition uses alarmist tactics. I note that the shadow Minister, in his contribution to this debate, referred to Singapore. He might like to explain how Singapore achieved its high level of success when it has a compulsory 22 per cent rate of contribution to pensions, which is nowhere near what the Government is providing for in this country. The alarmist tactics, in particular, were exposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in Question Time today. The Opposition has been referring to a Treasury minute saying that it shows that 100,000 jobs would be lost over the five-year period if the superannuation guarantee levy were introduced. Of course, what the Opposition failed to say, which is the very crux of this matter, was that it was not allowing for any trade-off between wages and superannuation. The Government has consistently said that we will trade off wage rises for the contribution to superannuation so that we do not get an increase in unit labour cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been of minor concern for some time to small business. It is interesting to note that, if the shadow Minister had actually talked to small business, he would have found out that it has consistently said that it does not disagree with a uniform superannuation scheme; it disagrees with the timing. When the business organisations met with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), as referred to by the shadow Minister, they said, `As we come out of the recession, it is going to be too much of an impost'. So what the Government did, in compiling information for the One Nation statement, was listen to the small business community and take into account what it said. Now it has deferred the introduction of the levy for over 80 per cent of small business until 1993-94, allowing small business to get the benefit of the recovery before the levy is imposed. We should always remember that that 3 per cent is not employers' money; it is employees' forgone wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had to then look at the other issues that were asked for by the small-business community leading up to the One Nation statement. This was one issue. There were other small business high priorities. There was capital gains tax relief, the provision of PDFs&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;VECCI is the organisation. There is more than one person in an organisation. Apart from that, there was enhanced export access and, more importantly, some provisions for debt write-off with the banks which was, I think, one of most innovative ways in helping small incorporated businesses. In the past, when banks have had to write off partial bad debt, they have had only one option&mdash;that is, to totally liquidate the company. Now they can partially write it off or do a debt for equity swap. That part of the small-business debt that is non-performing can be written off, the bank can claim the benefit and the business can continue to trade. There is also additional sales tax relief for the small-business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not really ever consider the small-business priorities. There is nothing in Fightback for small business, except a new tax. The shadow Minister is always talking about the benefit to small business of the abolition of payroll tax for small business. Of course, it is an absolute nonsense. Eighty-five per cent of small business does not pay payroll tax. As I pointed out in the House not long ago, the Opposition is taking a competitive advantage away from small business by giving the abolition of payroll tax to big business. That is, if one is running a shoe store in a shopping centre competing with Coles Myer where one does not pay payroll tax, the only person in that shopping centre who is going to benefit is Coles Myer because it can then reduce its prices as it is not going to pay the payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, even though this MPI is purported to be about small business, the only business the shadow Minister actually quoted was David Jones. I think it has been some time since David Jones has been a small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's whole miscalculation is that it really does not understand the role and the dynamics of small business. The Opposition thinks that if it has a bunch of policies and it tells small business that it is good for it, then small business will accept that. But that is not the case. This particular proposition, which passed through the House last night and which will go to the Senate for its concurrence, is, I think, one of the great reforms of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now an ageing population. No-one denies that. All of us sitting here are part of the baby boom generation. There are currently five taxpayers for every pensioner. By the year 2020, there will be three taxpayers for every pensioner. There will not be enough taxpayers to provide adequate pension facilities. We really have to provide a national superannuation scheme. The Government thinks that the most appropriate way to do this is to ensure that all Australians, not just those who are wealthy enough, are able to prepare for their retirement. If we do not do that we will have a greatly disadvantaged society as we move into the twenty-first century. It is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has had universal criticism of its superannuation policy. From listening to what people are saying, I understand that the Opposition will have to go back and re-draw it because nobody really believes that it has a superannuation policy. It has been shown consistently throughout Australia's history that, when it is left to people's own devices, the overriding needs of day-to-day living mean that people put off making decisions about their retirement. This is particularly true of young people. We want to get young people into this particular scheme so that by the time they get through the whole of their working life, they will be in the position of having prepared adequately for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people tend not to think about retiring. When they start work they tend to think that turning 30 is a limitation they will never reach. By providing occupational superannuation and award superannuation, we will have a vast number of people coming into the network and providing a continuing benefit. There will also be spin-off benefits for the small business community which will come from providing such a large pool of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the experience in Singapore. By having a large base of funds available for investment, there is an opportunity to develop the economy. It is clear that the large superannuation pool that has been built up in the Singapore economy has been of enormous benefit to the business community in that country. From my understanding, in Singapore one can either borrow against one's superannuation entitlement for one's home purchase or for starting a small business. That has freed up more money and enabled the banking sector in Singapore to invest in productive investment. I am sure that this will happen here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement there is a provision to create pool development funds, which I think is a very innovative way of trying to fill the market gap between debt and equity that exists in this country. The pool development funds would obviously be a very attractive proposition which people could invest in from the superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition continually says that the Government does not listen to the small-business community. I could not think of anything further from the truth. The Opposition's problem is that it does not even have a policy for small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may think it is an amusing matter, but the fact is that this is the voice of a large proportion of Australian small businesses and the issues which it raises are particularly important. I quote one paragraph in particular which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is absolutely no encouragement under the present system for employees to invest in tax deductible superannuation if they are on a marginal tax rate of 30% or less as their tax saving is offset by losing 15% of their contribution in the fund and being taxed at 15% on investment in the fund. The tax deduction only favours high marginal rate taxpayers who tend to have access to superannuation rather than lower paid employees.</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely one of the fundamental distinctions between the Fightback policy of the Opposition and the current ramshackle shambles of a policy put forward by the Government in the legislation introduced into this House yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental fact which the Government refuses to admit is a statistical one, and it is this: the current taxation arrangements give the top end of town about 32c in the dollar tax support on every superannuation dollar, whereas the average person at lower levels of income gets as little as 6c in the dollar. The fact of the matter is that the workers in small business are precisely the sort of people who get nothing at all out of the current Government policy, and regrettably they will not in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister told us earlier in his usual platitudinous tones that the Government is really about helping everybody in retirement, that we have an ageing population and have to be conscious of that, and that all of us should contribute to superannuation so that we will have a higher living standard in retirement. Amen to most of that. But let us look at the facts as distinct from the mirage which the Minister has been putting to us. The reality is simply this: the average lump sum pay-out at the present time is approximately $50,000. Anybody who bothers to look up the assets and income test for access to the age pension will have no difficulty in finding that people on that level of lump sum pay-out will be beneficiaries of the full pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go another step further. Let us raise the grounds of this argument. Even at levels of $100,000&mdash;for the benefit of the Minister that is 100 per cent more&mdash;the fact of the matter is that people will also qualify at least in terms of the assets test for access to the part pension. The point I am trying to make is simply this: the Minister can play around with the superannuation system until the cows come home; he can force everybody to come into his system for as long as he likes. But the sad reality is that, if the basic principle of his policy is that those people should be free of the welfare system in their retirement, he will have to rip apart the existing welfare system. Perhaps that is part of the hidden agenda of the Labor Party if it wins the next election. I can assure the Minister that there is no way he can square this circle, because the simple mathematics of the exercise do not add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague has already pointed out that in terms of small business the capacity to stay alive economically is vital. It is fundamental at the very time when bankruptcies have increased by over 50 per cent and when over 31,000 small businesses are no longer in existence because they have been declared bankrupt. A total of 79,345 small businesses have failed&mdash;and that is the ones we know about. God knows how many we do not know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said in this House on many occasions that, if every small business were able to employ one additional worker, effectively we could control, if not overcome, a large measure of the unemployment brought upon the Australian people as a result of the gross economic failures of the Hawke and Keating governments. It is this group of people in our community who are prepared to get out and have a go which will ultimately determine the economic strength of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had discussions earlier about the whole question of the Treasury estimates. The simple fact is&mdash;if the Minister wishes to read the document, I have it here; I am happy to give it to him&mdash;Treasury puts forward essentially two scenarios. Under both of those scenarios there is a loss of jobs. The principal point that we have been trying to make about this whole proposal is that it is flawed. It demonstrates a fact that we know so well: this Government is more interested in making a deal with the ACTU which will give it absolute and ultimate control over the last segment of the private sector over which the ACTU has very little control at the moment, namely, small business. The Government is prepared to do that at the cost of potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People employed by small business have a choice: they can either accept superannuation increases over five years and perhaps keep their jobs or run the very real risk of seeing no increase in their wages whatsoever. In terms of the Government's policy, in terms of this Treasury document&mdash;and that is all we are quoting&mdash;the Government has to say to people, `Don't worry, you're doing your bit for Australia. You'll be independent in your retirement, and God be with you'. The sad fact is that those people will not be independent in their retirement on the basis of the Government's policy because it is mathematically impossible to achieve that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Small businesses, those which employ less than 100 employees, make up 96 per cent of Australian enterprises.

It is absolutely beyond description how a government under current circumstances can come in here at this stage with a policy package which effectively means that people will lose jobs, not gain them. At the very same time, the Treasurer has gone on record as saying that before the end of this session, and certainly before the Budget, there will be a White Paper on superannuation policy. Perhaps somebody will produce one, but he certainly will not. He had the opportunity last night to explain to the House precisely what the Government's policy was, and he flunked it.

We get the Opposition pretending that it is concerned about small business and using the superannuation guarantee levy proposals as a means to further its own political motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI gives us the opportunity to highlight some of the positive things that have occurred in relation to the Government's approach to small business and the visionary aspects of our superannuation policies. I want to touch on a few of the matters that are significant as far as small business needs are concerned and to use that to work into the superannuation issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that needs to be said is that throughout the development of our policies we have recognised the special needs of small business. Going back to the One Nation statement, we recognise the special concerns small business had at that time to ensure the deferral of the super guarantee levy for firms under the $500,000 threshold. The Government agreed to that, and so there is a deferral for firms under that threshold. Their arrangement for bringing in the full contribution of superannuation has been deferred for that year, and they have a more graduated scale than larger firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, in the recent changes to the wholesale sales tax area, we recognise that small business should be relieved of much of the burden of wholesale sales tax. Of course, the changes that were announced in that area ensure that the vast majority of small businesses are not affected  by those wholesale sales tax areas. The Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) has already referred to other initiatives in the One Nation statement to give more access to funds to small businesses seeking export opportunities and to small businesses seeking additional arrangements through the goodwill transition arrangements on the capital gains tax. All of those things have been done because we recognise the important place that small business has in our economy and the special role it will have to have in economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as we have been doing that, the Opposition has pretended to show concern for small business. Yet, what would it propose as the alternative strategy for assisting small business? It proposes a 15 per cent goods and services tax. I do not know how many documents I have seen in recent times about the experience of the goods and services tax on small business in Canada and New Zealand, but one of the things that come through loud and clear in all of it is just what an administrative nightmare it is for small business having to complete the returns for the comparable goods and services tax arrangements in those countries; that is not what small business wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall from the report from the Minister when he was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology that small business complained at that time and made submissions about the need to ensure that its costs and its overheads because of government requirements were minimised. The very thing one would do if one was trying to ensure the maximisation of the administrative complexity facing small business would be to introduce a goods and services tax in the way the Opposition proposes. It will have a devastating effect on small business. It will be a real disincentive to employment in this country. That has to be compared, as I said, with our approach, which has at all times tried to assist and to encourage small business to streamline, to be more efficient and to make a more active contribution to the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the superannuation guarantee levy and we start getting international comparisons as to what effect this will have on Australia and how it will make us less competitive. There are a few things that need to be said. Firstly, over the last two days we have seen the most gross misrepresentation of what the Treasury actually put to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. We have had this reinforced in today's MPI by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). They have selectively quoted, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did yesterday, what the Treasury had said. But the fundamental point they decided not to quote was that Treasury went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this assumption is not regarded as reasonable. It is expected that the cost of the SGL will be largely, if not fully, offset by lower growth in other forms of remuneration, especially wages. In this regard the Government indicated in the One Nation statement that the scope for wages growth from other sources than the SGL will necessarily be lower than otherwise so as to ensure that enhanced superannuation does not impact adversely on cost structures and inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has recognised all the way through the need to ensure the maintenance of an eye on the inflation result, which has been a great achievement of the Government. Maintaining a keen eye on that is built into all our strategies. That has been one of the fundamental focuses of the arrangement between the Government and the ACTU. It is something on which we know the Opposition can never deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition can never grasp the fact that we have to run a wages policy that involves consultation and agreement with the trade union movement. Of course, small business benefits from the fact that wages growth, the real unit labour costs, is not as great. Part of the offset for that has been superannuation for the work force. That is a pretty fundamental policy difference between us, because, basically, the Opposition's policy, when it is narrowed down, represents the most wholesale attack on the work force of this country and a belief that workers of this country are not entitled to share in the benefits of an adequate retirement incomes policy. It is all right for the upper echelons of society to have that, but clearly the workers of this country, according to the Opposition, are not entitled to have access to that form of retirement income assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the result of that? We see the result in what the Liberals did when they were last in office. First of all, they had double digit inflation and interest rates. They had a policy that did not guarantee the security and certainty of wages. When we talk to businesses, one of the things they definitely say about this Government is that they recognise the Government's strength in the accord process and what that has meant in terms of stability, certainty and wages outcomes for them, together with the partnership approach between government and the trade union movement, which gives employers a certainty that they never had in the unpredictable days of the wages explosions of the late seventies and early eighties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that agreement between the Government and the trade union movement has been built around having the superannuation arrangements put in place. It is a responsible thing on the part of the Government; it is a responsible thing on the part of the trade union movement. When we look at what we have tried to do in terms of providing for our retirement and having a work force provide for its retirement, I think it stands as  a good advertisement for the achievements of the partnership between the Government and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are still well short of having all of the work force having adequate superannuation coverage, and part of the superannuation guarantee levy is designed to help ensure that. It is worth drawing some comparisons between what employers contribute to superannuation in other countries and what they contribute in Australia. In France, employers contribute between 12.5 and 15.25 per cent towards employee superannuation entitlements; in Italy, it is 19.53 per cent; in Greece, 10.5 per cent; Ireland, 11.3 per cent; Portugal, 24.5 per cent; Singapore, 17.5 per cent; and Spain, 24 per cent. Yet we are told that, because we have a superannuation guarantee levy that proposes reaching 9 per cent by the end of the decade, somehow that is not a reasonable figure; that it is an unfair impost on business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For goodness sake!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to recognise that we need to have some vision, some foresight, to plan for the ageing of the population that is occurring in the community. We are still going to be short of what is done in many other countries in terms of the employer contribution to employees' retirement, but at the same time we have recognised that it is essential that we build and make a start so that we are not leaving people in retirement in the next century relying on the age pension, which, if the Opposition ever gets into government, will just diminish as a real retirement income in the way it did under the Fraser Government. Of course, it would haemorrhage at a much greater rate because the number of people in the retired category would be so great that the Opposition would not give any commitment to maintain it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI gives us a chance to highlight, as the Minister has done, what we have achieved in recognising the relationship that we need to have with small business and also what we need to do in terms of providing properly for people's retirement. If the Parliament is not prepared to do that today, in 10 years time it will be too late, and the policies of the Opposition at that time will not enable us to provide adequately for retirement for the great bulk of the population. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The provisions of item 31 have been expanded to allow all aircraft parts, materials and test equipment for use in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of aircraft to be imported duty free.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to schedule 3 of the principal Act involve the treatment of motor vehicles.

Item 40G is inserted in schedule 4 to cover those textile orthopaedic goods excluded from heading 9021 by sub-note 1(b) to that chapter. This item will retain a free rate of duty for these goods.

<PARA>The A.C.T. Supreme Court (Transfer) Bill will enhance the protection of the independence of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, which is to be transferred to the Australian Capital Territory on 1 July 1992. At present, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 merely provides that from 1 July 1992 the ACT Legislative Assembly has legislative power in relation to the establishment and administration of courts. Without something more, none of the traditional safeguards of an independent judiciary are entrenched in Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian Capital Territory, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act takes the place of a constitution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 April 1992 the ACT Legislative Assembly formally requested that the Commonwealth Parliament amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act so as to provide a new part of the Act dealing with the judiciary. Specifically, the following provisions were requested by the ACT Legislative Assembly:</PARA>
<PARA>.a provision for the existence of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, which is to have all the original and appellate jurisdiction that is necessary to administer justice in the Territory;</PARA>
<PARA>.provisions for the removal from office of a judge, a magistrate or another judicial officer, only after a request to the ACT Executive by the ACT Legislative Assembly made in accordance with a report of a judicial commission, which has found that the behaviour or capacity of a person could amount to misbehaviour warranting that person's removal from office;</PARA>
<PARA>.provisions for the determination of judicial remuneration, which guarantee the non-diminution of that remuneration; and</PARA>
<PARA>.provisions to protect the position of the judges who will continue as judges of the Court after 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, the ACT Legislative Assembly is excluded from making laws in relation to the establishment of courts, subject to provisions of the Act providing for the transfer of legislative power. The ACT Magistrates Court was transferred to the ACT Government on 1 July 1990, when the ACT was given legislative power in relation to the establishment of magistrates' courts and coroners' courts. The Supreme Court will, under the existing provisions of the Act, be transferred on 1 July 1992 when the ACT obtains legislative power in relation to all courts, completing the process of transfer of ACT courts to the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill largely implements the recommendations of a working party comprising representatives of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories, the ACT Government Law Office and the ACT Supreme Court. The ACT Law Society and the ACT Bar Association were also consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the amendment of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988, both Commonwealth Acts, and the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1933, a Commonwealth Act which will become a Territory enactment on 1 July 1992. There are also some minor, consequential amendments of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Judges (Long Leave Payments) Act 1979 and the Judges' Pensions Act 1968. The amendments of the Self-Government Act include provisions for the:</PARA>
<PARA>.jurisdiction and powers of the Supreme Court;</PARA>
<PARA>.establishment of a judicial commission to investigate allegations or complaints about the conduct or physical or mental capacity of a judicial officer;</PARA>
<PARA>.removal of a judicial officer from office; and,</PARA>

<PARA>The amendments of the ACT Supreme Court Act include provisions:</PARA>

<PARA>.in respect of the jurisdiction and powers of the Court;</PARA>
<PARA>.for an oath or affirmation of office to be taken by the registrar of the court; and</PARA>
<PARA>.in respect of the appointment of officers to assist the sheriff. </PARA>
<PARA>The principal provisions of this Bill are those that entrench in Commonwealth legislation the traditional protections of judicial independence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appointment of judges in Australia is traditionally a matter for the Executive. While the ACT Supreme Court has been a court created by the Commonwealth, judges have been appointed by the Governor-General in Council. The Bill provides for all future judges and other officers of the Supreme Court to be appointed by the ACT Executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments of the Self-Government Act provide for the removal of a judge or other judicial officer or a member of a tribunal by the ACT Executive following a resolution of the ACT Legislative Assembly acting in accordance with a report of a judicial commission, in which the commission has concluded that the behaviour or physical or mental capacity of the judicial officer or member of the tribunal concerned could amount to proved misbehaviour or incapacity such as to warrant removal from office. This standard for the operation of a judicial commission is the standard recommended by the Advisory Committee of the Constitutional Commission in its 1988 report, paragraph 5.55. A judicial officer may only be removed from office by the Executive in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judicial commission will be constituted by judges who have been, but are no longer, justices of the High Court, or who are or have been judges of a superior court of record of a State or Territory&mdash;other than sitting resident judges of the ACT Supreme Court&mdash;and will be appointed by the ACT Government. The commission may be a standing commission or established ad hoc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retiring ages of the present judges and the master are protected by the provisions of this Bill. After 1 July 1992, the ACT Legislative Assembly will have power to make a law that establishes a retiring age for judges or the master that is different from that which now applies. New section 48B provides that such a law is to have no effect in relation to a judge or the master who was appointed before the commencement of the Act, unless the judge or the master consents, in writing, to the different law applying to him or her. It will therefore be possible for the ACT Legislative Assembly to increase or decrease the retiring age of members of the ACT judiciary, but the retiring age of the current members of the Supreme Court can only be changed with their consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a further safeguard to judicial independence, the amended Self-Government Act and the amended ACT Supreme Court Act will provide that the remuneration and allowances of a judicial officer cannot be diminished while the officer holds office, and the amended self-government Act provides that the remuneration and allowances of the chief justice, the judges, the master, the chief magistrate and a magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory are to be determined by the Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current chief justice and judges of the Court, except the additional judges, will continue to hold office on terms no less favourable than those of judges of the Federal Court of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some provisions of the Bill have been included to ensure that there is no doubt as to the fact that the ACT Supreme Court will continue to operate as the same entity after 1 July 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments of the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 will ensure the continuity of office of the judges and the master of the Court.

The AMLC Act currently provides that a certificate of analysis&mdash;for example, analysis of product for residues&mdash;is prima facie evidence of the information it contains. The deficiency arises, however, in that the certificate fails to establish that the substances which have been analysed were those found in the possession of the accused, seized and passed onto the analyst for analysis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major part of this Bill is to provide for amendments to legislation for the wool industry. The amendments relate specifically to the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, as part of the overall package of changes to the wool industry legislation, proposed amendments to the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964, and to the Wool Tax Acts (Nos 1-5) 1964, will be introduced separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of the package of amendments to the wool legislation is to provide mechanisms for distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission funds to woolgrowers and to introduce more flexibility into the current debt reduction arrangements. Both of these initiatives were recently announced in the One Nation statement. The package will also provide for other relatively minor amendments to the wool industry legislation, most of which are at the request of those involved in aspects of its administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry represents yet another case which clearly demonstrates this Government's capacity to work with industry to develop sound public policy. The Government's position has always been clear: we will accept advice from a variety of sources, we will consult with the industry and jointly develop a policy base that will take those industries forward. What we have also made clear is that we will not be driven by ideological approaches that fail to recognise the concerns and requirements of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware of the radical changes to the statutory industry framework and marketing arrangements for wool which came into effect in July last year. The new statutory authorities&mdash;the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the new Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool R&amp;D Corporation&mdash;have taken up their respective roles with enthusiasm and commitment. The AWRC, in particular, has a significant challenge in selling the stockpile and discharging the industry debt. At the same time it must have regard for the overall impact of its activities on the market. While ever there is a large stockpile, there is a potential for that stockpile to overhang the market in such a way as to create uncertainty and affect demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve months ago the stockpile stood at 4.7 million bales and the debt was around $2.7 billion. At the time we expected that the AWRC would only be able to pay off a small amount of the debt in 1991-92, and the debt schedule therefore set the repayment target for the year at $20 million. Since July the AWRC has been affected by a range of factors combining to enable it to achieve a higher income from sales from its stockpile of wool than was anticipated at the start of the season. The reasons for this include lower levels of wool production, the quality of the wool in the stockpile being different to recent drought affected production, increased demand for stocks to replenish the wool processing pipeline, and higher prices than expected. As a result, the AWRC is now well ahead of its required debt repayment target for this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To build on that better than expected outcome for the AWRC, the Government decided it was appropriate to change the AWRC debt reduction schedule from an annual to a cumulative basis, as announced in the One Nation statement. This provision will give the AWRC more flexibility in adjusting its operations to market conditions. In the event of a market downturn, the flexibility to pay off more debt in some years will give it the capacity to pay off less if returns are lower in others. It will, however, need to ensure that the maximum debt balances at the end of each year do not exceed the limits set within the cumulative debt schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible in some years that funds might be generated by the AWRC which are not prudently required for the debt repayment program. Therefore, recognising that most growers are currently receiving low incomes, the Government believes that a way is needed to distribute to growers any such surplus funds generated by the AWRC. In the One Nation statement it was indicated that any surplus funds not prudently required by the AWRC may be used as a rebate to growers in the form of a cash payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also gave a commitment to consult with the wool industry on the distribution of such funds to growers. Following constructive discussions involving myself, and with the agreement of the Wool Council, I announced in April that I propose to use any surplus funds generated by the AWRC during the current year as a rebate against the wool tax in 1992-93. My intention is that this will enable a reduction in the effective rate of the tax for the next season, while maintaining the prescribed rate of the tax at the existing 12 per cent. The Wool Council supports this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Bill will provide the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with the flexibility to distribute surplus AWRC funds as a rebate of wool tax, as a cash payment to wool tax payers, or to determine that the surplus should remain in the stockpile fund to pay off more debt. A determination would be made after the Minister had been advised by the AWRC if it holds surplus funds which are not required for the prudent management of the debt repayment program and the operation of the stockpile fund. Before making a decision, the Minister will be required to consult with the Wool Council of Australia about the distribution of the surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am optimistic about the future for wool. However, it is still very difficult to accurately predict what the market might do in the years ahead and therefore whether the AWRC will generate a surplus in future years. I am particularly mindful to also ensure that the objective to prudently manage the debt and stockpile sales must remain clear and uncompromised. To this end I will continue to strongly resist calls for a reduction in the overall prescribed wool tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not believe that, on the basis of one year's performance, it would be prudent to lower the prescribed rate of tax at this time. To do that might result in having to put the tax rate up again in a later year if the market suffers a downturn. The Wool Council of Australia endorses this position. The level of the tax rebate to apply in 1992-93 will be decided in June this year, and I will be considering the advice I receive from the AWRC on the size of the surplus when making that decision. I will also be consulting with the Wool Council on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, this Bill contains a number of other amendments which have been made at the request of the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wool Industry Council in the light of experience with the legislation so far. Generally these amendments are intended to finetune some of the administrative provisions. Three of them warrant some explanatory comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWC has requested modifications to the way in which the register of wool tax payers entitled to vote at general meetings is maintained. The proposed amendments will provide for grower registration and voting entitlements to be specified in a three-year rolling register. Growers will be able to update their details each year if they wish, but if they consider that the details previously provided are still relevant, then their entry on the register would be maintained for three years. In making these changes, the administration of the register will be simplified, and growers will be relieved of the annual requirement to make a formal application to be registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, an addition is proposed to the types of motions which can be put and voted on at an AWC annual general meeting. Under the current legislation, woolgrowers are unable to put forward motions on general business matters within the Corporation's responsibilities. The proposed amendment will mean greater accountability between woolgrowers and the Corporation by allowing a wider range of motions to be debated and voted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to ensure that the AWRC has the appropriate and well-defined powers to deal in hedging have been requested by it following discussions with financial institutions and in the light of legal advice. The changes will ensure that the Commission has the commercial flexibility which is consistent with its functions. The proposed changes are similar to recently made provisions for other statutory authorities and, in essence, ensure that the AWRC has the power to use hedging contracts to manage risks of variations in the cost of borrowings as well as risks of adverse variations in foreign currency transactions. In addition, the AWRC will be able to use hedging to manage returns on investments. Similar amendments have also been made to the AWC legislation at the request of the AWC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the request of the AWIC, the Wool Industry Council, an amendment has been made to the Australian Wool Corporation Act to provide additional flexibility in the registration authority of wool sampling sites, testing laboratories and show floors. Currently the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) is the sole registration authority. The proposed amendment will provide for the possibility that an alternative registration authority to NATA may be prescribed at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some minor amendments have also been made to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the PIERD Act. These amendments are required as a consequence of amendments made to the AWC Act regarding the establishment and maintenance of a register of woolgrowers for the purposes of voting at an annual general meeting. All of the proposed amendments which make up the package of changes to the wool legislation are responsible decisions. They finetune the statutory arrangements and show that the Government is sensitive to ensuring that there is an appropriate and flexible framework for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to this Act are to rectify minor anomalies concerning the allowing of minimum quantity or minimum monetary levels for small producers. In most levy or export charge schemes about 85 per cent of levy income is paid by only 15 per cent of the levy payer population, whereas 40 to 50 per cent of the population would pay less than the limits proposed. The intention is to allow small producers a threshold before having to pay a levy. Once the threshold is reached, the levy would become payable on the total quantity or amount. The basis for setting the threshold is not linked to the actual levy rates but is related to the estimated collection cost per levy return. These provisions will permit different thresholds to be prescribed for future levy years according to changing economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With full cost recovery for levy collections operating since 1988-89 there has been increasing pressure from participating industries for more economical collection techniques to be adopted by the Department.

<PARA>The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1992 and the accompanying Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Amendment Bill will set the framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements until the year 2000, and will have a substantial influence on the future direction of the Australian dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to set the rate of assistance for manufactured dairy exports each year up until 30 June 2000, to provide for the termination of Commonwealth underwriting for dairy exports from 30 June 1992 and to provide more flexibility in the way promotion and other industry funds can be expended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian dairy industry is one of our great traditional primary industries. Over the years it has experienced good times but there have also been bad times. The past few years in particular have been difficult, especially for the export sector, but as always the industry has shown great resilience and is adjusting well to meet the new marketing challenges. The package of measures that I will announce today will better equip the industry to handle those challenges. It is the Government's response to the Industry Commission's September 1991 report on the Australian dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the announcements go to both assistance and market development. It is proposed that there be a moratorium for a further 12 months on any reduction in market support. This is particularly to assist the situation in Victoria and Tasmania, where farmers have been hard hit. There will be a phase-down in market support to the year 2000 in equal instalments, taking the market support equivalent protection from 22 per cent above export parity to 10 per cent above export parity. I should point out that this 10 per cent above export parity is the equivalent of and is consistent with the tariff target of 5 per cent for manufacturing industry set by this Government. Importantly, it is a figure that has been achieved with the agreement of the industry. It is not a figure that was advocated by the Industry Commission, which the Opposition, I might note, was locked into. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, let us have a closer look at the dairy industry. There are just under 15,000 registered dairy farms in Australia producing about 6,400 million litres of milk per annum worth about $1.7 billion. The industry is labour-intensive, directly employing some 50,000 people and indirectly employing a further 50,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria is the key dairy State, producing about 60 per cent of national milk output. The wholesale value of processed dairy foods is around $4.5 billion&mdash;and manufacturers and processors add nearly $3 billion of extra value. Around 30 per cent of milk production is exported as dairy products worth around $700m. East Asia accounts for 67 per cent of Australia's dairy exports. Japan is the largest market, closely followed by the Philippines. Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand sales opportunities are increasing as a result of continuing income growth in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986, my colleague the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. John Kerin, introduced what became known in the industry as the `Kerin plan'. The aim was to wean the industry from its reliance on government assistance and to make it more commercially based and more responsive to market opportunities. There would be few in the industry who would disagree that the `Kerin plan' has been a great success. The industry is now neither backward nor is it stagnant. It is adopting state of the art technology and adjustment has been taking place on a continuing basis. Farmers have, for example, been leaving the industry at a rate of around 3 per cent per year. Nevertheless, national production has tended to increase. There has been continuous amalgamation of and investment in manufacturing facilities and a shift in emphasis from commodities to the marketing of profitable value added products. Nominal assistance to the export sector has reduced from around 45 per cent in 1986 to the current 22 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `Kerin plan' assistance terminates on 30 June this year. The challenge has been to develop a new set of arrangements that would be consistent with the Government's broader industry objectives, maintaining the momentum created under the current arrangements and yet recognising that the industry is currently feeling the effects of low world prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the package I will now detail will achieve all of these objectives. It is the outcome of productive consultations with the industry's leadership and I believe it has a large measure of support within the industry itself. In its development I have sought a strategy that capitalises on the technical and marketing achievements resulting from the six years of the `Kerin plan' and provides the framework that will enable a more productive, internationally competitive and export focused sector to develop. I believe that the process of interaction that I have gone through with industry has enabled the laying of a sound foundation for the industry's position up to and beyond the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that the important thing about this outcome is that it does reflect the active consultation with the industry. That is the important difference between our approach and the Opposition's in terms of addressing industry development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to also give praise to the industry with whom I have negotiated this package of reforms. The Australian Dairy Industry Council represents both producers as well as processors and therefore is an important body because it involves more than just the grower end of the market. It had to negotiate this in difficult circumstances. Not only did the Council have an IC report which it could not live with&mdash;and members of the coalition could because they were committed to introducing it&mdash;but also it had to cope with the disciplines associated with our position in the GATT and a constituency that was arguing for the retention of the status quo. But against that background, I challenged it to come forward with a strategy for the future, one that would secure the industry and make it grow. The Council has responded. I sat down with it and we negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I want to make particular mention of the contribution of Mr Pat Rowley, the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council. The success of the `Kerin plan' is in no small measure due to Mr Rowley's determination to see the Australian dairy industry adjust and prosper in the face of difficult market conditions. He was a very forceful advocate on behalf of the industry in the recent negotiations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance to the export sector will remain at the 1991-92 level of 22 per cent of average export prices throughout 1992-93. This is in recognition of the difficult circumstances currently facing many dairy farmers and will provide some time for the industry to re-group. Thereafter, the rate of assistance will be reduced in equal steps each year to 10 per cent in 1999-2000. This 10 per cent market support rate is consistent with the 5 per cent tariff target for manufacturing industry because of the manner in which dairy market support applies and reasonably reflects the Government's industry objectives as announced in recent policy statements. The new arrangements will `sunset' on 30 June 2000. The industry's leadership accepts that the dairy industry should expect no further legislative support beyond the year 2000 and that it will be treated the same as other industries at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with current Government policy, government underwriting of dairy export returns will terminate on 30 June 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements will have no direct impact on the State market milk schemes. These are a State responsibility and continue to provide the major portion of the measured assistance to the dairy industry. Most States have in place, or are planning, significant deregulation post the farm gate. This is a commendable objective which may lead to significant changes. I welcome the current moves for a more uniform national approach to UHT milk pricing. The possible inclusion of enhanced farm gate pricing regulation, the so-called section 38 type provisions, will remain a controversial issue and my only comment on this aspect is that States may find it prudent not to be locked into any new farm gate pricing regulation which does not offer scope for flexibility to deal with changing market conditions. I propose to keep developments in State market milk arrangements under review in the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an added discipline on the States, the Government has decided to terminate the so-called comfort clause from 30 June 1992. This provision has provided a connection between the Commonwealth arrangements and the State schemes. This enabled any State to seek suspension of the all milk levy and so discourage interstate milk trade. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kerin plan was aimed primarily at raising the farm gate return for manufacturing milk. It also involved the removal of the longstanding practice of equalising domestic and export product returns. The changes exposed dairy manufacturers more directly to market forces. Consequently, a more efficient manufacturing sector has evolved through technology transfer and infrastructure rationalisation. Nevertheless, dairy manufacturers are still some way from achieving their potential in both a well-developed marketing ethos and operating practices. The Government has therefore decided to add a second element to the new marketing arrangements to encourage further development in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impetus for change will come from a redirection of the operation of the Australian Dairy Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the Dairy Research and Development Corporation to further enhance the industry's export marketing and market development, particularly for profitable higher value products. I will be working closely with the Australian Dairy Industry Council and with the corporations in the coming months to put in place specific activity that will assist dairy manufacturers in the general area of market development. This Bill makes provision for more flexibility in the use of industry promotion funds and the Dairy Industry Fund in market development activity to provide additional funds to support and reinforce the industry's marketing efforts. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council has a legislated role under the current arrangements in respect of a range of policy issues. This is an unusual status for an industry based body and is different  from the current representational model based on statutory industry councils. Nevertheless, the Council has operated responsibly in its administration of the Kerin plan, and the Government has decided to continue that role in relation to the new arrangements. On the other hand, the Council is industry based and cannot avoid an agri-political role. This Bill provides for ministerial scrutiny of the funding of the Council to ensure that funds available for its policy role are not used for other purposes. This process will ensure that the contribution of the Council to industry policy development remains under review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cooperatives have historically been a feature of this industry, and a large part of the industry's rationalisation in recent years has been through co-operative mergers. Co-operatives are regulated by State legislation. I believe their effectiveness could be improved by consistent and uniform legislation throughout Australia. Progress to this end through Commonwealth and State ministerial councils has been slow. I am seeking to hasten change so that the cooperative sector of this and other industries can pursue commercial goals and benefits that are presently hindered due to inconsistent legislation between States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package I have just detailed will provide an industry arrangement that is transparent, predictable and progressive. It highlights the benefits of consulting with industry and it underscores the fact that this outcome for the industry could not have been achieved by the coalition, because of its blind locking into the Fightback package, which proposes the elimination of tariffs and the adoption of IC recommendations. There is no flexibility in the Opposition's position at all, and that is why the National Party, in particular, has found itself in such great difficulties within its own constituency. On the other hand, this Government has taken a reasonable approach given the industry's current situation and the desirability of further assistance reductions. It will take the industry to the end of the decade and leave it in good shape to face the future thereafter.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986 to complete the measures that will set the framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements that I have outlined in my second reading speech on the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. This Bill extends to 30 June 2000 the imposition of the market support levy which provides funds for the market support payments on manufactured dairy exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also repeals section 6 of the principal Act, which is known in the industry as the comfort clause. The provision allows for any State to seek suspension of the market support levy through the processes of the Australian Agricultural Council, which is now known as the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand. Its effect has been to enable any State to discourage interstate trade in market milk. The Government accepts the industry's view that this levy suspension provision has outlived its usefulness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Remuneration and Allowances Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 has three principal purposes. Firstly, it sets a new salary structure for the Industrial Relations Commission; secondly, it varies the Remuneration Tribunal decision on the salaries of vice-chancellors and; thirdly, it broadens the range of persons eligible to chair the Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular Bill invites the House to discuss the future of the Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;in particular, its role within the contemporary industrial relations system. It also asks us to look at the status of Industrial Relations commissioners and their appropriate salary levels. Given the recent controversy which has surrounded the resignation of Commissioner Turbet from the Commission, I think it also invites us to examine the proper relationship between the Commission and the government of the day. Finally, it invites us to discuss the Remuneration Tribunal and its role in setting salaries for the Commission and for others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commencing this debate, I would like to take issue with the remarks of the previous speaker, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who addressed the House on Monday night. He made what I could describe as an enlivened speech, although it was not a particularly new one. I think it was essentially the same speech that he delivered in the discussion of a matter of public importance the previous week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister based his case upon an examination of the resignation letter advanced by former Commissioner Turbet. The shadow Minister read a great deal into that. He said the letter demonstrated that the Government had no proper respect for the Commission, that the Commission was being stacked with appointments from the union movement and, really, that the whole authority of the Commission would now be so greatly damaged that confidence in it could never be restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I did take great interest in what the shadow Minister had to say, I could not particularly agree with many of the conclusions that he reached. Firstly, while the resignation of Commissioner Turbet is obviously a matter of some embarrassment to the Government&mdash;I would not try to pretend otherwise&mdash;to say that his resignation and the reasons he advanced in his resignation sound the death knell of the Industrial Relations Commission as we know it and mean that the Commission has no future role in the industrial scene of Australia is, I think, a gross exaggeration and is not borne out by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point Commissioner Turbet took great issue with was the failure of the Government to follow through on the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, which had recommended a substantial increase in the salaries of commissioners. This whole matter has some sort of history. It stems from an original decision of the Tribunal&mdash;of, I think, about 18 months ago&mdash;when a 14 per cent increase was recommended. This increase came against a background when the Government and the Commission were asking Australian wage and salary earners to exercise considerable constraint for economic outcomes. I imagine that it was a bit hard for ordinary workers to accept that they were being asked to limit their wage demands at that time to an overall level of 6 per cent, when the very people who were setting their wage rates were asking for an increase&mdash;and it was recommended that they receive an increase considerably above that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, as is its express right, did not agree with the decision of the Tribunal, and a subsequent decision was made to grant a 6 per cent rise with a second rise to follow after a review of the functions of the Commission. This review was carried out by a committee headed by Mr Gleeson, who was the former head of the Premier's Department in New South Wales. It was a very sound review and its recommendations about restructuring the Commission have been accepted by the Government and, indeed, have now been enacted into law by this Parliament. I believe the new structure was, at that time, supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter then went back to the Tribunal in order for it to determine what the new wage structure within the Commission should be. Quite simply, the Tribunal failed to resolve the matter. It set no salaries for the new structures and, against that quite extraordinary decision of the Tribunal, the Government decided to proceed with this particular course and bring this particular Bill to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commissioner Turbet has taken great exception to that, and he cites it as his principal reason for resigning from the Commission. That resignation is a matter of regret and certainly the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has said that quite openly and publicly. But to conclude from the disappointment of Commissioner Turbet that the Industrial Relations Commission is about to fall over, that it has no future role, or that its authority has been greatly diminished is to overstate the case completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission and its forebear, the Arbitration Commission, have been part of the industrial landscape of Australia since Federation. Indeed, there have been many times throughout its long and colourful history when the government of the day, particular commissioners, and the Commission as a whole have not always seen eye to eye. The Commission has lived long past the particular whims of those governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, in the letter of resignation submitted by Commissioner Turbet, he recounted the experience of the Bruce conservative Government in 1929 which, at that time, tried to eliminate the Arbitration Commission from the industrial landscape. That particular Government fell on the floor of the House and was subsequently soundly defeated at the general election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there might be a lesson in that for my colleagues opposite who now also go to the Australian people with essentially the same policy as the conservative Government of Mr Bruce of 60-odd years ago. Mr Bruce's Government was soundly defeated. I think the Opposition&mdash;which thinks that the Australian people do not have a deep respect for the Industrial Relations Commission, the role it has played, and the future that it has in our new industrial system&mdash;may also bring about the wrath of the Australian people when it proposes policies which essentially eliminate a future role for the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the role of the Commission has been greatly diminished. As I have said, there have been disputes with it before in the 1950s. Certainly the labour movement as a whole did not support the wage fixing principles and attitudes adopted by the Commission at that time and yet the Commission went on from strength to strength from those disputes of the 1950s. Certainly, the Fraser Government did not achieve everything it wanted in terms of its submissions to the Commission and yet the Commission continued to play a role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this Government did not agree with the April 1991 wage fixing decision, with the refusal of the Commission at that time to endorse the move towards enterprise bargaining, to take from that the long bow that the honourable member for Bennelong did and to say, `Well, that is it; the game is up for the Commission; its authority has been destroyed or diminished' is to ignore the lessons of history. I would be a little more circumspect than was the honourable member for Bennelong in suggesting that the game is up; I do not think it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong then went on to attack the accord process and the Government's approach to industrial relations. I took great interest in this because I have been listening to the honourable member, certainly for the five years that I have been a member of this House, and maybe for a few years prior to that. During the life of this Government the accord has been a bit of a hobbyhorse for the Opposition. The Opposition has seen great fault in it throughout its entire history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong built himself up to a bit of a crescendo and said that the accord process had failed the most important test. I waited with bated breath to find out what this test was going to be. I remembered that a few years ago the test that the accord always failed, according to the Opposition, was the inflation test. It was always argued by those opposite that under the accord process inflation was built into the system; that the accord guaranteed a wage increase to Australian workers which built in inflation because prices would rise and so on. We now have a situation where the latest inflation result in Australia was a zero rate, with an annual inflation rate of 1.7 per cent and an underlying inflation rate of 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, the honourable member for Bennelong has moved the goalposts a bit in terms of this important test for the accord process. No longer is inflation the real evil of the accord. The real and the most important test now, according to the honourable member for Bennelong, is productivity. The Opposition says that the accord has failed because there have not been sufficient increases in productivity in Australia. I accept that Australia has not had a great productivity performance, probably going over many decades. But I was a bit bemused to hear the honourable member for Bennelong put this as the great test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member believes that the Government is failing in increasing productivity levels in Australia and that the accord is failing to deliver better productivity, one would assume that the Opposition's own Fightback proposals, its blueprint for Australia, would project better productivity outcomes than are occurring under the accord, which is failing the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go to page 16 of the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document, we see the figures by which the Government is supposedly damned by the Opposition. Page 16 tells us that on the OECD figures the rate of Australian productivity increase per annum from 1983 to 1990 was 0.9 per cent. The Opposition says that is a pretty dismal result, that it is fairly poor and that we have to do a lot better in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same document we will look at the three scenarios which the Opposition says are possible outcomes from the implementation of its Fightback proposals. Scenario 1, which is the low result, if you like, predicts a productivity outcome for Australia of 0.4 per cent. That is less than one-half of what the Opposition says was a dismal record flowing from the accord. Anyway, that is the low road. Obviously those opposite do not expect that to happen; they expect much better outcomes than 0.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go now to the middle road, the middle of the range estimates of what would be the productivity outcome under the Fightback proposals. Lo and behold, the productivity outcome in that scenario is 4.3 per cent&mdash;just marginally above what the low road outcome would be. Anyway, those opposite are eternal optimists and no doubt will go to the Australian people and say, `Well, we will not get the low road proposal; we will not get the middle road proposal; our policy will deliver the best possible outcome, the highest possible outcome, according to our projections'. So let us look at what the best possible outcome, the high road outcome, would be for productivity under the Opposition's proposal. Lo and behold, it would be an 0.8 per cent increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government has been attacked for producing a result on OECD figures of 0.9 per cent&mdash;but it is higher than the Opposition's best possible case. So this is the important test that the shadow Minister says the Government has failed, the accord has failed&mdash;the test of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policies completely reject the accord and would scrap the whole process. It sees next to no role for the Industrial Relations Commission. Yet the best scenario under its policies has a productivity performance for Australia which is actually less than that which it is criticising the Government for producing under the accord process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the goalposts have been moved concerning the accord and the Government's industrial approach. The Opposition would hardly make the important test one relating to industrial disputes. Industrial disputes are never mentioned by our friends opposite because they know that the industrial dispute record under the accord has been absolutely streets ahead of anything that they achieved in their period of government or would be likely to achieve through the so-called new big bang approach to industrial relations&mdash;the old `troops on the wharves if it is necessary' line that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong now promote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not talk about the important test being industrial disputation because their record was dismal and the accord has cut it by about 60 per cent. In fact, the most recent figures for January 1992 show that days lost through industrial disputation in Australia are at a 30-year low. I do not know whether that is too bad a test for the accord to be judged against or for the Opposition's policies to be judged against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already outlined, the other test for the accord used to be inflation. Under the accord, we have managed to control the rate of inflation through the very strong boom of the mid- and late 1980s. At that stage unions and employees in many sectors of the economy could have gone out and grabbed much larger wage increases than they did. But through the accord process, through the concept of a social wage, a social contract, we were able to restrain wage demands, which enabled us to come through the boom and into this period of recession&mdash;not with double-digit inflation which was the hallmark of the last recession presided over by the Opposition parties, but with a declining inflation rate and one which is now considerably below the OECD average and below those of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that is also a fairly important test of what the accord has delivered and a fairly important test against which the industrial and other policies of the Opposition should be judged. We know what would happen to inflation under the policies of those opposite. With the introduction of a tax on food and clothing, there must be an inbuilt increase in inflation; the debate would be only about how much inflation would go up. There is no doubt that inflation would go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the third test of productivity, the productivity outcome under the accord process has been higher than would be the case under the three scenarios in the Opposition's proposals. So, if productivity is no longer the great test for the accord to pass, I wonder what the next test will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Commission does have a role in an enterprise bargaining situation. The Opposition cannot see how it can. It sees it as a vehicle of a central system and that the whole essence of industrial enterprise bargaining is to move to the coalface, the workplace, negotiations between employers and employees. Those opposite argue that in that system there is no role for a central umpire. The Government rejects that for a very important reason: unlike the Opposition we do not see the cost of labour simply as a cost that can be reduced. We do not see labour in there simply with raw materials and the whole rest of it and an attempt being made to minimise the costs, to get them down to the lowest possible total cost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be many examples of industrial parties equal enough in power for there to be fair enterprise bargaining and fair collective bargaining.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of the Australian work force works in medium and small businesses. In fact, the vast majority of these particular businesses are not covered by unions. The industrial relations system and the Industrial Relations Commission provide a safety net. They provide a test of public interest so that we know when we test our enterprise bargaining and our agreements that they maintain basic conditions which all Australians, regardless of where they work or what their occupations are, should be entitled to enjoy. That is why there is a role for the Industrial Relations Commission. It is an institution which I have great affection for. I have no doubt that it has a future and that its future will be assured under a Labor government. </PARA>

Only one Government representative was scheduled to discuss this important Government initiative and he spent his 20 minutes attacking, first, the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard); second, Commissioner Turbet, of the Industrial Relations Commission; and, third, the Opposition's Fightback proposal to rejuvenate this sick nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talked at some length in the latter part of his speech about the accord and how it has brought us to a low level of inflation and industrial disputes. That, of course, is not the point of this Bill. Let me point out to the honourable member for Fisher that this country has a staggering unemployment level and that we have been at record levels for a record period of time. If there ain't no jobs, there ain't no pay increases and there ain't no reason for disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is about changes to the structure and salary mechanisms of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, brought down by the Remuneration Tribunal. This Bill is all about destroying the independence and, therefore, the integrity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think perhaps it might be useful for us today if we had a bit of a history lesson with respect to this Bill. In May 1990, the Remuneration Tribunal brought down a finding recommending a 14 per cent pay increase for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The Government then countered through Senator Cook with a proposal for a 6 per cent increase on 1 July 1990 and a 6 per cent increase in January 1991. The Government then changed its mind and dumped the 1 January 1991 proposal, so essentially the Remuneration Tribunal recommendation of 14 per cent was revised by the Government to 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1990, following `robust' discussions, Senator Cook set up the Gleeson Committee which would report into the structure of the Industrial Relations Commission. On 1 March 1990, the Gleeson Committee report was handed down, adding a vice-president and a senior deputy president. The Gleeson Committee's brief, as I understand it, was to examine the structure of the AIRC and its internal workings. Other issues raised directly or as a necessary consequence of the Committee's terms of reference were the conditions of service and the conditions of status of the AIRC members. The future role of the AIRC and its relationship with other tribunals and the courts was also discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a preface to the Committee's report, the Committee said that the new structure may:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . also facilitate development of a judicial jurisdiction dealing with industrial matters, for example, a Labour Court or an Industrial Division of the Federal Court, constituted by appropriately qualified AIRC members.</PARA>
<PARA>That meant that Senator Cook then had his opportunity to give us his and the ACTU's long awaited, long desired Federal industrial relations court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 March, the Gleeson report made a lot of recommendations. In relation to remuneration, the Committee recommended: first, that there be no legislative nexus with any other group such as Federal judges&mdash;so it recommended that we break the Federal judge nexus; second, that there be a salary linkage between the office of the President of the AIRC and the Chief Justice of the Federal Court; third, that there be a salary linkage between the proposed positions of Senior Deputy President and the judges of the Federal Court and that that salary be a benchmark for internal relativities in the new structure; fourth, that the linkage between the Federal Court judges and senior deputy presidents be reviewed at least every five years by the Remuneration Tribunal and also in the case of major changes in judicial remuneration; fifth, that the Government should seek to disallow a Remuneration Tribunal determination only where extraordinary&mdash;and I repeat extraordinary&mdash;circumstances arise. Today obviously is an extraordinary circumstance because we are here discussing this Bill which is at variance with the Remuneration Tribunal report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 March 1991, Senator Cook accepted the review. On 28 March, Senator Cook made a submission to the Remuneration  Tribunal, and on 16 April the AIRC brought down a national wage case decision with respect to accord mark VI. It substantially rejected mark VI and all holy hell broke loose. The Commission had the audacity to say that the parties, in its view, were not yet mature enough to handle enterprise bargaining. So it brought down its decision with respect to the national wage case at variance with accord mark VI between the ACTU and the Federal Government, represented by the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook. From that date literally millions of words have appeared in print, been heard over the airways and been expressed in speeches in this House and elsewhere regarding the appropriateness of the Commission's decision and its role or non-role in the fixing of wages and conditions of employment affecting many millions of employees across the width and breadth of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue regarding the role of the Industrial Relations Commission is just one more example of the arrogance of this Government, its lack of response to the will of the people and the denigration of the role of parliament and the judiciary in our democratic society. Last year the Australian Bar Association drew attention to the fact that the independence of the judicial and quasi-judicial bodies in our country was under threat. The Chairman of the Bar Council, Mr D.L. Harper, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recent action by members of the Federal Government has served to emphasise the immediacy of that threat.</PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, the then Treasurer, now our Prime Minister, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> of 5 May 1991 as saying that the Industrial Relations Commission would have to rethink its position or it would not have a position. Secondly, the Minister for Industrial Relations, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 May 1991 indicated that any determination of the Remuneration Tribunal which sought to pass on benefits of the national wage case to Australia's Federal judiciary would not be implemented. Thirdly, Mr Wally Curran, the Victorian Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 12 May 1991 as having accused the Industrial Relations Commission and the commissioners of lacking ability, obvious bias, hypocrisy, impropriety and incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, Mr Bill Kelty, Secretary of the ACTU, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 2 May 1991 as having said in relation to the decision of the AIRC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sickening decision, but there is no reason for the trade union movement to eat the vomit.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harper, in his statement on behalf of the Victorian Bar Council, went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These examples are but the latest in a series. They demonstrate an attempt to downgrade the status and role of the Commonwealth judiciary and of the Industrial Relations Commission. They herald an attack, no doubt unintended, on democracy itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is not one of benefits for individual members of the judiciary or quasi-judicial bodies. The issue is whether the judiciary can be independent if its pay and conditions are subject to government whim; and whether the Industrial Relations Commission should exercise independence of judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its actions, the Federal Government has attacked the institutions best positioned to protect democracy against the encroachments of executive power. It has placed the rule of law and the freedoms of a civilised society in jeopardy. It deserves condemnation in the strongest terms.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Harper has rather eloquently stated the major case of concern by all those practising law in Australia. But I remind honourable members that the Industrial Relations Commission is not a court of law; it is in fact a statutory body, a commission, given legitimacy by an Act of Parliament. I have no doubt that the executive members of the Commission, including the President and the Deputy President, consider that the Commission is a court and, as such, is entitled to total independence from both parliament and the executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 May 1991 Senator Cook made a supplementary submission with respect to the national wage case. On 15 May 1991 he amended the Industrial Relations Act. It was the second amendment to the Act in 1991. Its purpose was to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to give effect to the recommendations of this Gleeson Committee's review of the structure of the Industrial Relations Commission, including the creation of new positions of Vice-President and Senior Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong, in his speech to that Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not lament the breaking of the nexus between the salary and remuneration of presidential members of the Commission and judges of the Federal Court because I do not regard&mdash;and nor does the Opposition&mdash;the Industrial Relations Commission as being a court.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is because Amendment Bill (No. 2) in part anticipates the establishment of a labour court that the Opposition will oppose the Bill in this House and it will be opposed in the other place</PARA>
<PARA>And with good cause. This side of the House has always been opposed to a labour court. I return to the history. On 30 November 1991, six months after royal assent, the amendment came into effect. On 24 December 1991 the Remuneration Tribunal reported, and, once again, all holy hell broke loose. That resulted, I might say, in the now famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;letter  from Mr Ken Turbet, Commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission.

I know of his great knowledge on this subject and his concern about the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. Whilst it is quite clear on this side of the House that the Industrial Relations Commission will have a lesser role when we are in government, it is a remarkable feat by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and this Government to chop down the Industrial Relations Commission by stealth and the sort of antics that the previous speaker has alluded to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has said, we have been quite clear and up-front about what will be the role of the Commission when we are in government. Yet this Government, by the very actions that other speakers have alluded to, is removing the Australian umpire for industrial relations, as the Government sees it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration and Allowances Legislation Amendment Bill allegedly seeks to create a new salary structure for members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by initiating a different nexus between the salaries of the Commission appointees and the Federal Court judges. In doing so, if the Bill is passed, it will effectively overturn the Remuneration Tribunal's determination No. 21 of 1991. The Bill will also end the necessity for the Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal to be a judge, either active or retired, or to be qualified to be a judge in a State court. The Bill was introduced under the auspices of the Minister for Industrial Relations, who has been referred to by other speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 March in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Paddy McGuinness gave what I thought was a rather apt new title to the Minister when he described him as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minister assisting the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Secretary of the ACTU (Mr Kelty).</PARA>
<PARA>Paddy McGuinness sees where the allegiances of the Minister really lie. This is a very serious charge to make, but it is supportable. I suggest that the Minister, a former office bearer with the Building Workers Industrial Union, has produced measures time after time that seek to place a large gap between those who have powers bestowed on them by the industrial relations club and those outside this historical anachronism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Government, those in the IR club are those who are unionised, the militant, those in the public sector, and those who refuse to adapt to the 1990s by sticking with outdated Luddite approaches, such as needing a highly paid umpire to always mediate between employers and employees. Those outside the inner circle include the non-unionised, the subcontractors, the unemployed and those who work for small firms in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What ideas does one of the men the Minister is accused of serving, the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, have for the future of the Australian industrial relations system, the Commission based in Nauru House and the union movement in Australia? In a very revealing piece of evidence in the AIRC hearing on 13 September 1990, Mr Kelty spelt out his view rather succinctly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(We must) create a new wages system. . .involving . . . a diminution of the authority of bodies such as the ACTU; bodies such as the conciliation and arbitration commission of Australia, as more and more is done where more and more has to be done, and that is in the workplaces of this country. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is debatable whether more is in fact being achieved in the workplaces of this country, for only about 90 new workplace deals under what the Government laughingly calls a corrupted enterprise bargaining system have been actually concluded. There is no provision for groups of workers, other than the 40 per cent of Australians who are union members, to conclude the agreements. It is very important for members of this House and the electors of Australia to understand that only union members, under the auspices of the so-called enterprise agreements that the Government has drawn up, are entitled to conclude these enterprise agreements. This is a classic case of restrictive trade practices; only unionists can draw up these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to concern myself largely with the provisions of the Bill that seek to alter the pay alternatives for Industrial Relations Commission members. The Industrial Relations Commission is a body that has grown in recent years, despite the savage recession that has seen the number in full time employment drop from 4.2 million in December 1990 to just on four million today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look at the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's last two annual reports indicates that the number of office bearers, be they commissioners, deputy commissioners or others, has gone from 47 on 1 June 1990 to 53 on 1 June 1991. A similar number of disputes was notified under section 99 of the Act in each year&mdash;that is, 3,600 disputes. So we needed more commissioners to handle the same number of disputes. One can only conclude that the complexity of individual disputes has increased, which is logical as the atmosphere of compromise, so valiantly proclaimed by the Hawke-Keating Government since the adoption of the accord, has begun to dissipate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last Industrial Relations Commission annual report, some 98 possible areas of dispute were listed, of which the vast majority had entries during that year. Let me list some of these strange entries. They include leading-hand allowances, allowances for reimbursement of expenses, allowances for tools, travel and clothing, as well as trade union membership. Many of these matters are trivial and should hardly take up the time of a government body. Little wonder that many commentators are suggesting that Australia needs a new broom to sweep through the morass of industrial relations provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this Bill is controversial, very largely because of the recent resignation of Commissioner Ken Turbet, a longstanding member of the industrial relations club and the Labor Party. Other members of the coalition have referred to this. I, like other members on this side of the House, would like to quote from Commissioner Turbet's letter of resignation, because it sets on the public record a remarkable attitude of mind by the commissioner towards the Government and his concern about the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in 1992. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government cannot be relied upon to keep its word. A classic example. . . is your about face on the Gleeson Committee's recommendation in regard to recognition of the Remuneration Tribunal. . . The Government accepts that it should only seek to disallow determinations in exceptional circumstances. . . There are 15 pages (supporting the decision). . . The actions of the Government have damaged the public's perception of the Industrial Relations Commission. . . (It) can only work effectively when it has the respect of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment of the Government that is by a man who is almost an ex-commissioner of the Industrial Relations Commission, which the Government is so clearly undermining. That is from a man with 14 years as a commissioner, another 16 years as a trade union official and, to add insult to injury, another 20 years as a member of the ALP. What more authority could we have for the sorts of comments that he makes about the Government and its attitude towards the Industrial Relations Commission?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration Tribunal has been given a Government mandate to make decisions with regard to the fixing of those salaries at the IRC. One would have thought that the normal procedure would not be varied unless absolutely extraordinary circumstances arose, as Mr Turbet pointed out. The Remuneration Tribunal noted on page 5 of its 1992 review:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government was invited to submit reasons why such a distinction (between fixing the level of remuneration of a presidential member of the Industrial Relations Commission at 95 per cent rather than 100 per cent of that given to a relevant judge of the Federal Court) should be made. . . No acceptable reasons were provided for such a change.</PARA>
<PARA>Has there been the necessary extraordinary alteration in circumstances that would warrant government intervention? There has been none, and nothing has been proven to date. Discord has certainly emerged from the Industrial Relations Commission, based in Nauru House. The resignation of Mr Turbet is just the tip of the iceberg, as I understand it, because of the Government's attitude to the Commission and to the commissioners at a personal level. The honourable member for La Trobe demonstrated that by quoting some remarks of Mr Wally Curran, the Secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there has been much disquiet amongst the office-bearers who are left. The lawyers, who have given the Commission a balance and enabled it to determine very complex issues, are leaving and are being replaced by appointees from the ACTU. Previous governments tried very hard to make appointments that kept a balance between the employers and the unions. It is obvious&mdash;and it was defended here by the Minister in the House&mdash;that the Government is going to `even it up', so-called. When one of the union appointees resigns, the Government will `even up' the numbers by appointing a further union person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill really conceals a much wider issue of industrial relations. The question of remuneration for these senior personnel in the Industrial Relations Commission has to be looked at as a small part of the overall industrial relations strategy of this Government. In Australia we now have a corporate style of government where big unions, big government and big business seem to act in unison. Anyone outside these groups is hardly listened to. That is exactly what the retired Commissioner suggested:  nobody would listen and nobody had respect for the arrangements that the Government was imposing upon the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that in the private sector, union coverage is down to 31 per cent, and still falling. The figure is much worse because, typically, 15 per cent of those union members are unfinancial. I repeat: private sector union coverage is down to 31 per cent. People around Australia should be very aware of that fact. The Industrial Relations Commission is based on unions being registered and members of the work force being paid-up members of various unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the three groups, big business fares worst. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 19 March headed, `When Kelty speaks, Keating listens', the industrial editor, Brad Norrington, in part, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Shortly before Christmas 1989, Keating and Kelty agreed that a reworking of the accord would see unions bargaining at industry or workplace level according to some vague notion of improved productivity and profitability . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Norrington went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . deals . . . are routinely tied up ahead of official negotiations by Paul Keating and Bill Kelty with little outside input . . . The problem for the political process of the accord is that it no longer has any proper checks and balances.</PARA>
<PARA>Most of the award restructuring presently under way is being driven by the needs of the peak union body, the ACTU. Little attention is being paid by this Government to whether alternative models of workplace bargaining are possible or, in fact, what the Industrial Relations Commission might think about it. Why cannot common law contracts be encouraged, as we on this side of the House are advocating? At least, unlike many determinations of a centralised and rather rigid Industrial Relations Commission, these outcomes are market derived. Depending on the profitability of various industries, voluntary contracts could be entered into. Australians have to remember that they cannot live in lotus land any longer, and the one million unemployed would give testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government regards the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and its members as an integral part of the domestic institutional set-up;  at least, it did until the recent conflict between the Government and the Commission, which in part created the controversy over this Bill. Mr Kelty has now decided to let the Commission down by any means possible and destroy the role of the Commission in industrial relations arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accord is a direct relationship between the ACTU and the Government, rather than individual unions. To give the accord political legitimacy, the Industrial Relations Commission has had to agree to the methods employed by the ACTU to broaden its influence amongst the Ministers of this corporatist government. A very important factor is that inevitably the Industrial Relations Commission had to agree to the provisions of the accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How has the ACTU done this?  It has adopted a policy of strategic unionism which, as the ACTU explained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>, means:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . A high level of (union), resources. . . supplemented by contributions from the general community through government expenditure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Some of these contributions from the Government, such as the funding of artists in residence at the Victorian Trades Hall Council, would be well beyond the imagination of many of the office-bearers of the Industrial Relations Commission or the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU, which seems to be determining the payments that will be made to members of the Industrial Relations Commission, often makes strident claims about the success of the so-called accord which commenced in 1983. The Australian community is repeatedly told that the accord has created hundreds of thousands of jobs, led to a stable industrial relations environment and allowed for low inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence, at best, is contradictory. The period from 1979 to 1987 is a good period to consider some facts, as the first mentioned year was midway through the Fraser period and the end year was midway through the accord period of so-called compromise, when the bosses were called names if they even lifted a finger against anyone taking a sickie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial factor is not whether Australia's performance improved compared with the previous period, but whether Australia could hold its head up against other industrialised nations. Certainly between 1979 and 1987 there was a 71 per cent fall in industrial disputes, measured in strike days lost per 1,000 employees, but the average fall amongst Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, the UK and the USA was 78 per cent per thousand employees. Other factors were at work around the world and in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More alarmingly, Australia's labour productivity has grown more slowly than that of OECD nations. Between 1973 and 1979, prior to the accord, Australia's average increase was 1.6 per cent against an OECD average of 1.8 per cent. After the accord commenced, the figure for Australia was 1.1 per cent and that for the OECD, 1.8 per cent. In other words, Australia's ratio of productivity improvement against that of the OECD declined from 89 points to 61 points&mdash;a disastrous performance. No wonder Australia has been slipping down the totem pole of international competitiveness!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the Remuneration Tribunal, the Keating Government, as well as all its allies in the trade union movement, enter the 1990s with the Kelty-Keating relationship riding high. Why should this Parliament be spending valuable time debating matters such as whether judges of the IRC should have their salaries cut by 5 per cent or 6 per cent when our performance is not keeping pace with that of the rest of the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has been looking very closely at the changed industrial relations system in New Zealand. Only this morning, the dramatic nature of what those changes could do to the profitability of companies and the country in general was demonstrated. I refer to a press clipping from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of this morning entitled `Smelter rejoices in labour reform'. In that article Mr Stewart, the Managing Director of the Comalco company, pointed out the dramatic changes that had taken place under the new industrial relations arrangements introduced by that Government. He pointed out some quite remarkable changes in the Comalco works when the industrial relations climate and background was changed by statute. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few remarks on the Remuneration and Allowances Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. I am not sure that there will be anything new in them, as the debate so far has probably canvassed the issues that are involved. However, as previous speakers have said, industrial relations is assuming increasing importance on this side of the House. We see the need for change in the industrial relations system as being absolutely vital if this country is to be turned around. For my part, at least, I take quite an interest in that subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I participated in a debate on the reform of the construction industry, and in that particular speech I catalogued in some detail the concerns that the Opposition has about the Government's handling of industrial relations. This legislation highlights those concerns. In many respects the Bill is not of itself momentous, but it is the background to this Bill which casts a considerable shadow over it and, indeed, over the Government's handling of industrial relations as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unique relationship between the Labor Government and the union movement, particularly the ACTU, is self-evident. The current President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, has said that he sees the ACTU as a partner in government with the ALP. There is great concern in the community about this particular relationship. A number of speakers have alluded to the so-called Keating-Kelty relationship which, in many respects, is a very suspicious one indeed, particularly the extent of that relationship evidenced in the overthrow of the former Prime Minister. The whole process of that coup started at Kirribilli House in Sydney. Mr Kelty was present as Mr Keating's ally in the arrangement that was to be made for the supposed orderly hand-over of power. We now know that that did not eventuate in any shape or form. The overthrow did come, but there was much blood on the floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our suspicions about the role of the ACTU in industrial relations in this country have been confirmed consistently. They have been proven to be well and truly on the nose. A number of speakers in this debate, including the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who led for the Opposition, spoke about the fact that it has recently come to a head with the resignations of a number of members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Some of those members, including the President, publicly expressed grave doubts about the independence of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Opposition, in pointing to these circumstances, is in any way grasping at straws. The embarrassment that the Government has suffered over the resignation of Ken Turbet in particular must be extreme. The Government has been able to refute very little of the criticism that Mr Turbet heaped upon it. He comprehensively tipped a bucket on the Government from a great height. In the debate honourable members have spoken of the qualifications Mr Turbet had. They referred to his experience, the background and the context in which he was able to make his remarks. There was no doubt that all of us were astounded by what he had to say from his perspective, in the way that he quit his job and attacked the Government on the way out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to cast any aspersions on current serving members of the Commission, but when we pick up one of Ken Turbet's criticisms it is interesting to note the composition of the Commission as it is today. There are 13 deputy presidents who have been appointed since the election of the Labor Government in March 1983. Five of them have union backgrounds, five more practised as industrial lawyers, one is a former Labor politician and one is a leading academic. So there has been a very strong connection. The role of the Commission has in many respects been influenced, and to some extent usurped, by the ACTU. In that sense it is no wonder that Ken Turbet had that parting shot at the Government as evidence of his and, indeed, Deputy President Russell Peterson's growing disenchantment with the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look back a short time to see how this disenchantment grew. We go back to the April 1991 national wage decision. For Ken Turbet and others that was really a watershed. It exposed the full extent of Government and ACTU interference in, and to an extent, I suspect, intimidation of, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In that decision the Commission, to its credit, and acting responsibly, refused to endorse the key elements of the accord mark VI, as it was then. It attempted to exercise some independence, as it was bound to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know what the results of that were. The claims for a $12 increase, 3 per cent superannuation improvements and variation of the no extra claims commitment to provide for additional enterprise claims were knocked on the head by the Commission. With some consternation we observed the reaction of the ACTU. The decision had not been rubber-stamped on this occasion. This particular Keating-Kelty deal was not the subject of immediate compliance or acquiescence by the AIRC. We saw some distinctly colourful language flowing from Mr Kelty's mouth as he described the decision as a rotten egg that would not be eaten, and various other abusive terminology  was subsequently used. The ACTU wages committee then decided to reject that particular decision. At the time the Confederation of Australian Industry in its newsletter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACTU appears to be caught up in its own invective: what the ACTU decides should occur, must occur, or it will take all action open to it to cause damage.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we saw that, if the ACTU did not like it, it would turn around and lump the AIRC. The Confederation of Australian Industry also described it as extraordinary that the Government was taking the drastic course of encouraging the ACTU in its rejection of that particular decision. It was not only encouraging but aiding and abetting, I would suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the ACTU was committed only to the principle of self-determination. The union movement, in conjunction with the ALP, was determined that it would decide the outcome of the national wage proceedings. The role of the Commission was to be a rubber stamp. If it was not prepared to be a rubber stamp and implement what the ACTU and the Government put to it without too much delay, it would incur the wrath and invective of the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contempt for the processes of the Commission was also associated with a concerted attack on the independence of the Commission. The ACTU apparently induced the Government to introduce legislation which broke the statutory link which had existed between the salaries of deputy presidents of the Commission and Federal Court judges. It replaced that link with a separate process of assessment by the Remuneration Tribunal. That separate assessment process would, of course, be influenced by submissions put to it by the Commonwealth and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the history of this also. The outcry from the Commission and employers led the Government to rush off and form a committee to try to extricate itself from the embarrassing situation it found itself in, and the Gleeson inquiry resulted. The AIRC's new structure was adopted consequently in opposition to the AIRC's views. The Federal coalition opposed those changes at that time because of the ACTU's blatant intervention in the Remuneration Tribunal's determination process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From all of this, and from what other speakers have said, we see that the ACTU continues to be a law unto itself. It holds itself out in so many respects to be above the law that every other Australian individual and entity is subject to. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper in its editorial on 24 April summed up the situation pretty well. It did so after Ken Turbet tipped the bucket on the Government. The heading for that particular editorial was `Cook's industrial mixed relations'. That seems to be pretty descriptive of what industrial relations is all about from the Government's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The editorial goes on to outline very clearly the duplicity of the Government's and the Minister's approach to industrial relations. The Government is caught in suspended animation in respect of industrial relations. It realises that change is in the wind. In fact, it has become more than a wind; it has almost become a hurricane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government realises belatedly that we as a country have been left behind the rest of the world in respect of wage fixing practices. However, instead of biting the bullet and doing something about it, the Government is paralysed by its relationship with its union mates. It has chosen, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> also points out on this occasion, to subvert the Commission and `bully it into accepting its anomalous form of accordian enterprise bargaining'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be making a very short speech to indicate to the House that the Opposition will not be opposing the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, consistent with the constructive approach that the Opposition always takes to legislation in this House. In other words, we will be taking an approach of agreeing with something that is sensible and along the lines of the path of true reform which is advocated by the Opposition. It is our intention not to oppose this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no exaggeration to say that one of the reasons why this piece of legislation has come forward is a consequence of the urging by the coalition, especially in another place, that the Government progressively implement the recommendations of the Brown committee of inquiry into the Comcare system. The House may recall that, at the time of the last debate on amendments to this particular piece of legislation, the Government was somewhat castigated by the Senate for not having implemented the amendments that were recommended&mdash;or all of the amendments, or sufficient of the amendments&mdash;by the Brown committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very pleased to see that, in this particular situation, the Government has decided to remedy that. We are especially pleased to see that the Government has decided to license Telecom and Australia Post to perform the functions of Comcare. We also support the greater movement towards the adoption of a user-pays principle in relation to the services of Comcare. In our view, that is a very welcome development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his news release titled `Comcare Australia Heading for Competition' of 29 April 1992, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new business plan to take the Federal Government's Workers' Compensation Authority . . . from its position as a government monopoly to a more commercially competitive enterprise will be launched at 10am, Thursday April 30, in the Grand Ballroom, National Convention Centre, in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>I share all of the aspirations contained in those words. We certainly have no argument with attempts to make the Comcare organisation more competitive. Most of the moves that are contained in this legislation are along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will be aware that, on many occasions when legislation in my portfolio area comes before this Parliament, I spend all of my allotted time castigating the incredibly inadequate industrial relations policy of the Government and its insensitive attitude towards high levels of unemployment. On this occasion I do not intend to use my allotted 30 minutes, because the amendments proposed by the Government are sensible. There is not much point spending 30 minutes saying that the Government is sensible. In fact, it is almost anti the interests of the Opposition for me to spend 30 minutes saying that the Government is sensible. I am content to say in a few minutes that the Government is sensible on this Bill and leave it to others, who may have a variety of views on whether the Government is sensible, to participate in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too support the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which makes a number of important reforms. They are not highly significant, other than in respect of the fact that we need to take some of the directions that have been outlined by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is good that there has been a vast improvement in efficiency and in arrangements for workers compensation and its payments through Comcare. There have been a great number of improvements, but there is still a need, for instance, for a system of licensing for self-insurance and in-house claims management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation meets with flexibility and more efficiency some of the needs that have been found in the workers compensation area. Under the Bill Commonwealth authorities can have three types of licences. They can have a class 1 licence, under which they operate as self-insurers and compensate their employees; they can have a class 2 licence, under which they can determine their own claims; or they can have a class 3 licence, under which they can self-insure and also determine the claims of employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Bennelong said, we see here the adoption of the user-pays principle. We also see that guidelines are laid down by the Commission for the Safety,    Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees. There have been some extremely important changes in safety attitudes within the workplace. I recall that when I became the member for Eden-Monaro nearly 10 years ago, I went to a sawmill and presented a number of safety awards to people at that sawmill. Most of the people who received the safety awards had one or two fingers missing and one had his arm missing from the elbow. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays, when one goes to a sawmill, one sees that the younger people are in much better order. No longer do they have that pride factor that seemed to stop people taking the important safety precautions that they are now taking. When I recently went to the Nimmitabel sawmill, there were men and women observing safety precautions in the proper way. The legislation is an important component as we work towards both safety and rehabilitation, and it implements a number of both minor and fairly important measures. I am pleased to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to support the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill and the remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Comcare, which is another mechanism for workers compensation, is an issue of some importance throughout the Australian community. It is, of course, a very important industrial relations issue. We have used traditionally a number of mechanisms to financially support those workers who, through no fault of their own, have been injured at work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally, Australian industry has not taken well its obligations to its work force or its responsibilities in training its work force to prevent injuries at work. It seems to me that one of the most important aspects of modern management, in terms of this whole industrial relations debate, is its being able to get the maximum cooperation and the maximum productivity from the individuals who work for an enterprise. So whatever it is that the company produces&mdash;whether it is meals for a restaurant, mouse-traps or automobiles&mdash;or whatever it might be engaged in in the training sector, the people who work together in the enterprise do so to produce some useful product or service that people in the community want. In producing that product or service, the enterprise is allowed to generate an income in a manner competitive with like enterprises, both here and overseas, and some portion of it is distributed to the people who make up the enterprise itself and have produced the useful work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the centralisation of our industrial relations system and because of the concept of conciliation and arbitration in a semi-legalistic sort of system, we have set up artificial boundaries. We have tended to create an atmosphere, an ethos, in which management sits on one side, as Labor sits on one side of the table in this chamber, and the work force sits on the other side, as the Opposition sits on the other side of table in this place. That concept of division and divisiveness surely must come to an end. And it must come to an end quickly because our foreign debt, which is now over $145 billion, is not slowing. Our current account is still in deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we consider the need to create a more productive Australian economy. In order to produce it, we need cooperation from one side of the table to the other. We do not get cooperation with confrontation; we get it by talking together and working together. It seems to me that management's attitude that if management supplied the workplace, it was the workers' responsibility to work safely, and if workers did not, it was their problem if they got hurt, is as archaic as the centralisation of our industrial relations system itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this day and age, it behoves those who own the business or the enterprise to work with the people doing any physical or other work in the enterprise and to come together to arrive at mechanisms for preventing injury at work. The mechanism that we use to pay individuals who cannot work because they have been injured creates great divisiveness across our nation. There is no question about that. Many of the State systems have created tremendous angst in the unions and among employers. In my State of Victoria, there is an ongoing debate over WorkCare. On one side, the system is seen to be full of rorts and, on the other side, it is seen to be not sensitive enough to compensate those individuals who might be hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety in the workplace is an attitudinal problem as well as a cooperative problem. We need to work towards a solution. If we attempt to prescribe safety as we are attempting to prescribe training and superannuation, and as we have prescribed compulsory union membership, then we will of course fail. We will not reach new plateaus of safety records because, by prescribing, we will not gain the hearts and minds of those who are doing the work and who need to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to develop a cooperative approach. Any company with modern management knows that its most important asset is its people. If it can protect its people, if it can enthuse its people and if it can bring its people to become involved in the ethos of that enterprise, the enterprise has a much greater chance of success than it ever would with any system of confrontation or prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the issue of safety, it is my view that we need a training mechanism. We need to address the issue of literacy&mdash;which I have spoken about a number of times in this place&mdash;with respect to workplace safety. Australians and migrants who, as yet, are without Australian citizenship but who have come to live in Australia and accept the benefits of our society, want work. If they have not accepted the benefits and taken advantage of English as second language programs in order to develop English language skills, they will find themselves severely disadvantaged in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, of course, their chances of finding a job if they do not have one are probably quite remote. But we need to make sure that our new Australians and our migrants gain the English language skills that they need in order to do their job, to give them a satisfactory understanding of the society in which they live, and to understand the requirements of their workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the safety issue, it is important that they be able to read safety signs and notices, that they be able to read rule books with respect to safety practices in the workplace, and that these rule books be developed in a cooperative manner in consultative committees by the work force and those who own the enterprise. A number of issues are critical to Australia's gaining a new ethos: one of work in a safe environment to prevent injury and to keep our valuable asset&mdash;the work force&mdash;employed in a productive manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other issue that I would like to address very briefly before I give way to the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford), who I know has some very important messages in relation to this particular Bill, is the business of Commonwealth Government bureaucratic organisations having preference clauses for union membership and, in some cases, prescribing compulsory union membership. I have spoken in this House on a number of occasions about voluntary membership of organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems clear to me that it is only the Government&mdash;the public sector in this country&mdash;that props up union membership to the level it is at today. Whereas union membership is now 30 per cent or less as a percentage of the private work force, the government sector of the work force is highly unionised. The Government helps to promote that mechanism by automatically deducting union dues from employees' wages. This makes it all so easy for employees to belong to a union, whether or not they receive any benefits from the union or whether or not they wish to be members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of compulsory union membership concerns one of our most basic freedoms: the freedom of membership of an association. Just as we have freedom of speech, freedom to write, and freedom to breathe the air, we should also have the freedom to associate with those with whom we wish to associate. Compulsory union membership is an abhorrent system which is imposed on many of those in the work force in this country, and nowhere in greater numbers than in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In attempting to lift productivity in the public sector while we talk about raising productivity levels in the private sector, in my view it is critical to our approach that we abolish any compulsory union membership, that we abolish preference clauses, and that we abolish automatic deduction of union dues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill, which will not be opposed by the Opposition, introduces three distinct amendments to the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Even though this Bill will not be opposed, I want to point out some basic problems and offer some basic criticisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment will allow the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees to licence other government authorities and other government departments. Here we have what I believe is the ridiculous situation of one bureaucracy actually licensing another bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth authority will be granted by the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees. This new bureaucracy will be able to grants three types of licences: firstly, the whole, or part, of Comcare's obligations to compensate employees; secondly, the whole, or part, of Comcare's function in determining its employees' claims; and, thirdly, a combination of the above. The licensing system will allow particular authority to cover all, or part, of Comcare's obligations to compensate its employees. Needless to say, in practical terms, this process is basically another job creation scheme for Labor's new constituency: the new class trendies with their degrees from the Dawkins's universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will the taxpayers have at the end of the day? They will have more bureaucrats and another expensive and unaccountable group of quangos&mdash;mostly secure in their Canberra bunker and far removed from the problems of real Australia. The employees of the Commission and all involved in the supervision will, of course, enjoy the perks so essential to oil the wheels of bureaucracy and ensure the nation's continued prosperity: security of tenure, regular salaries, travel, flexitime, training programs, study leave and so on. Yet what expertise will they have had in this type of insurance&mdash;surely it is an insurance problem? Does the Commission plan to employ actuaries and others with expertise in the insurance field? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each existing bureaucracy will, therefore, be expanded to include its own employee compensation department&mdash;or what might be called SICOs: sinecures in Commonwealth offices. Once established, these SICOs will take on a life of their own. They will multiply and proliferate and they will cost millions of taxpayers' dollars. Every department will have one, all staffed by highly qualified permanent graduates whose work basically duplicates what is already available in the private marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government departments operate with privately built motors cars; why can they not use private insurers? How many SICOs will be established, I ask? If one goes through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Government Directory</EMPHASIS> one finds that there are literally hundreds of departments spread throughout Australia. I question whether each one of these will have its own little Comcare type section. Will these apply to each location? For instance, the Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Department of Administrative Services operate in each State and offer a wide variety of services in each State. At what level will these licences be issued? If each one of these departments gets a licence to operate, surely there will be hundreds of licences spread throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second range of amendments proposed by this Bill relates to finance. Comcare will receive premiums to cover its liabilities and administration costs. But this is really what Comcare's role is at the moment. It does have expertise in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had several constituents in Dunkley who have needed assistance with various Comcare claims. In my opinion, Comcare has always been an efficient organisation, considering the legislative framework in which it has to work. My constituents have mainly had problems where Comcare has said, `Well, this is all we can do under the Act'. Clearly in certain circumstances its hands are tied. I have made a number of appearances before the Comcare appeals tribunal, endeavouring to have some matters clarified and settled. But in this new utopia of government control and regulation, each department will have its own little SICO unit. No doubt each one will operate under the same rules as Comcare or be licensed under the same rules as Comcare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People employed before the CERC Act of 1988 commenced work under one set of rules. As one would expect from a government unable to stop meddling in things it should never even be involved in, these rules were changed in 1988 with the consequence that Comcare's ability to perform its task successfully has been limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a claim is prior to 1988, what would happen? I suppose a Comcare unit would still run the case. But what if the department itself decided on a class 3 licence? A whole new number of staff would have to become familiar with aspects of cases which can be very complicated indeed. But no doubt we will see a massive recruitment of new class legal people who will be employed to administer an unnecessarily complicated set of rules. It is an ideal scenario for the Canberra mandarins and another disaster for the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment will allow for the recovery of costs from Commonwealth departments and authorities. The Commission will be able to enter into commercial arrangements under which it provides services related to its function on a fee for service basis. Why then as a logical extension cannot a department or authority make its own identical arrangements with private insurance companies? Why must government departments be restricted to using their own or other government bodies for services? At a guess, my answer would be that such a practice would limit employment opportunities here in Canberra&mdash;and, as we know, this would constitute the end of civilisation as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in his second reading speech, stressed that the licences are to be subject to a system of conditions that one government department imposes upon another, the cost of which will inevitably be passed on to the unfortunate taxpayer. The Minister stated that each department or authority must comply with strict conditions. If these conditions applied to private industry, there would be strict penalties for non-compliance. The concept of bureaucrats subjecting other bureaucrats to penalties is incredible. As we all know, bureaucrats are completely immune from the discipline of the market and market forces. Any penalties they might incur for wrongdoing will simply be passed on to the taxpayer and paid for out of public money. It is, of course, a very different story when the Canberra mandarins are making rules for the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister also offered departments or authorities the possibility of bank guarantees&mdash;no doubt in lieu of early payments&mdash;so that the banks could be asked to guarantee tax collections. This surely is a new approach to funding government. However, I cannot see anything in this Bill which makes this insurance scheme fully funded. It appears that costs only have to be recovered. What has become the scandal of WorkCare in Victoria commenced on this basis, without proper calculations. It is virtually inevitable that the largest employer in the nation will soon run up huge debts or unfunded liabilities. If these unfunded liabilities are added to other government unfunded liabilities such as long service leave, termination and redundancies, pension entitlements and superannuation entitlements, the burden on the taxpayer of funding the Public Service cocoon will become even more horrendous than it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these liabilities worth billions of dollars are added to the nation's other liabilities such as our overseas loans, the country will be in an even bigger mess. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today at Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) admitted that the country is in a mess. The mess revolves around one million unemployed, a recession that he made us have, an horrendous overseas debt, declining productivity and a prehistoric industrial relations system which continues to disemploy our youth and to pay homage to nineteenth century traditions of class struggle and craft unionism that are singularly inappropriate for Australia in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will not do anything for the unemployed. It will not lessen the burden of overseas debt by 1c. If anything, it will slow economic growth and impede business while various government departments and authorities become more inward looking. This myopia would not matter so much except for the fact that many major projects and private sector initiatives are held up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems facing Australia in the 1990s is the uncontrolled growth of the government and public sector. As the example of eastern Europe so vividly demonstrates, government is incredibly bad at doing many things. It is very bad at running transport systems, factories, labour market programs, social services, universities, mines, car plants, restaurants, insurance schemes and so on. Government fix-it schemes, subsidies to exporters and the mania for bureaucratic or expert picking of winners are precisely the wrong directions in which this country should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of government is to have sound finance. A major priority must be to keep down public expenditure and borrowing. Otherwise, government is simply stealing the very resources that industry needs in order to grow and invest. It is scandalous that this country has such a low rate of domestic savings. Americans, and more recently the Japanese, have built their great industries on a high savings ratio. Australians must be encouraged rather than punished&mdash;as they currently are&mdash;for saving. Prosperity will return to this country only when it is recognised that competition and markets with properly defined property rights are the vehicles for economic success and individual freedom. The absence of legal rights is a crucial factor in explaining the poverty of socialist regimes and the poor performance of corporate states when government and business do deals and when government establishes itself in a monopoly position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One need look only at the experience of the last 20 years to see that government has virtually never managed to secure a competitive advantage in the production of goods and services. The results of the Commonwealth establishing yet another government authority would simply add weight to my argument. Indeed, the Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1992 is yet another example of what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) referred to the other day as the scandal that has become government in Canberra and the scandal that has become government in Australia. This is an example of a government out of control and an example of a squandering of taxpayers' resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are not opposing this Bill, there are really a number of questions and problems that arise, particularly from the Minister's second reading speech to which I will refer. On page 1 he states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main focus of the Bill is to continue the reform of Commonwealth employees' compensation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, my experience indicates that the problems are with the Act, not with Comcare itself. Further on, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers was emphasised.</PARA>
<PARA>Comcare is centralised in each State and its influence at the workplaces spread all over the country certainly is limited. I question whether licensing is the answer or just making each location responsible for its safety. On page 2 of the Minister's second reading speech he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission was restructured as a regulatory body. . . This includes determining compensation premiums.</PARA>
<PARA>Now a licence will allow self-insurance quite freely. On page 3 the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the CERC Act in 1988, provision was made for both Australia Post and Telecom to become self-administrators of the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation Scheme. This was for a two year trial period. Under these arrangements the two organisations were responsible for all aspects of the administration of the CERC Act for their employees.</PARA>
<PARA>This new Act appears to cover not just Telecom and Australia Post but other authorities with no commercial application. He states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the implementation . . . It does so in a way that is consistent with preserving flexibility and increasing efficiency in the operation of the Commonwealth's Employee Compensation arrangements. But, at the same time, it will ensure that the licensed authorities operate under an appropriate system of regulation by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>I question whether the Commonwealth or its authorities should be in the employee compensation arrangements anyway. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth authorities will be able to apply to the Commission for licences under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It would be hard to imagine a situation where a licence would be declined. I think it would be automatic. On page 4 of the Minister's speech he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A class 1 licence will allow an authority to operate as a self-insurer.</PARA>
<PARA>This may be satisfactory, as I mentioned earlier, for Australia Post or Telecom, but is it satisfactory for a non-commercial type enterprise, of which there are literally hundreds in the Government directory? The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conditions able to be set by the Commission will include conditions limiting the maximum liability for which a licensed authority may self-insure, or in respect of which it may make a determination . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">liability . . . will revert to Comcare depending on the class of licence.</PARA>
<PARA>Comcare in this instance has been an underwriter and an insurance broker. Is it capable of that particular function, I ask? Page 5 of the Minister's second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because a licensed authority will be bound, as a condition of its licence, to comply with the Act, a failure to comply with the guidelines or directions of the Commission will involve a breach of that condition. The Commission will be able to suspend a class 2 or class 3 licence or revoke a licence of any class for breach of any condition. It will also be able to direct a licensed authority to comply with the conditions of the licence. The provisions of the Bill also detail the effects of a suspension or revocation.</PARA>
<PARA>If this were a Bill applicable to private industry, penalties would be involved. Why not in this particular case? On page 6 the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill aims at simplifying the operation of the CERC Act by including a special or standing appropriation. There will be payable to Comcare the moneys necessary to meet undischarged liabilities for claims under the previous compensation arrangements. In addition, Comcare will be paid amounts equal to the administrative costs attributable to these claims.</PARA>
<PARA>How is this possible without detailed actuarial calculations and conflicts with the financial impact statement later in the Minister's statement? Page 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Finance may determine the opening balances for the special appropriations and the rate of notional interest to be applied to the balance from time to time in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA>These could be quite large sums of money. I trust this will be clearly shown in the Budget papers. The Minister continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will also be able to estimate contributions that are payable by all departments and authorities covered by the OH&amp;S Act. In this way each department and authority will contribute to the cost of administering the Act based on its own occupational health and safety record, and having regard to other specified matters.</PARA>
<PARA>I anticipate that these would be compiled by actuaries and compiled accurately. I come to the final aspect of this Bill, the financial impact statement on page 8 of the Minister's second reading speech. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in the Bill are not expected to have a significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about tens of thousands of jobs&mdash;all the jobs in the Commonwealth Employment Service. We are talking big sums of money in premiums which may not have a Budget allocation and may have liabilities for future claims of billions of dollars. It could have a very significant financial impact. Although the Opposition is not opposing this Bill, I hope that my criticisms and comments will be taken into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill 1992 brings on an important debate which has ramifications for the whole aviation industry in Australia. In August 1990 the Government announced its intention to transfer the remaining Commonwealth-owned aerodromes to full local ownership. Those local owners&mdash;and most of them are local councils&mdash;would then become responsible for the operation and maintenance of these aerodromes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airport local ownership plan, commonly referred to as the ALOP, was to be phased out by 1994. However, the One Nation statement provided an additional $25m for the phasing out of the ALOP by June 1993. That program has been accelerated and that is causing quite a bit of concern amongst the local councils and local owners under the aerodrome local ownership plan. The ALOP has been funded by a loading of 3.010c per litre on aviation gasoline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the handing over of local aerodromes is now well under way, this Bill has been introduced to allow a reduction in the rate of excise to correspond with the reduction of government outlays for the ALOP. Initially the reduction will be just 1c per litre, applicable immediately. A further 1c reduction will apply when the number of Commonwealth airports is reduced to 100&mdash;the Government expects that to be later this year&mdash;with the full sum being reduced with the termination of the scheme in June 1993. The amendments proposed in this Bill will not result in any net revenue loss to the Civil Aviation Authority or the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the Bill, but I will highlight a number of issues, particularly the problems that are being experienced by local owners and local councils in the operation and maintenance of these aerodromes under the ALOP. I have a very important aerodrome in my electorate which services a lot of aviation traffic. The management committee of that aerodrome would want an assurance from the Government before the phasing out of the ALOP in June 1993 that the aerodrome is brought up to the standards that are acceptable by the Civil Aviation Authority. It would also want to ensure that all of the navigation directional beacon is relocated from Maiden Gully to the airport, and also that the flight paths for that airport are exactly defined and are appropriate to the operation and the continued efficient operation of the Bendigo airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of reasons why that airport needs to be kept open, and one of the most important is the emergency services including air ambulance, the regional fire services and the State Emergency Service as well as a number of commercial operators who use the Bendigo airport on regular occasions and who provide a very valuable service. That airport is quite capable of handling some quite large aeroplanes. In fact, Prince Charles and Princess Diana visited Bendigo in an RAAF aircraft, which was equivalent to about a 707 size aircraft. It was quite capable of landing on that strip and taking off from that strip. So it is an important part of the aviation world. It also forms a link with other local ownership aerodromes throughout Australia and forms a very important part of the transport network in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition has given a commitment to maintenance support for rural, remote and regional aerodromes under its Fightback package. It has made a commitment to the local councils and local owners of those strips. We believe there is a community service obligation which entails the maintenance and ongoing support for those airstrips throughout rural, remote and regional areas. We have heard a lot of talk from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about improving transport infrastructure in this country. He made some attempt at it in the One Nation statement, but most of what was talked about included rail and not much was mentioned of this particular plan. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, $26m but that is revenue neutral. The Government is going to rip it off them from avgas anyway. That is what this Bill is all about. The Government is not putting any more money into it. It should not try to kid the local ownership and the councils that it is. The Government is just taking some of the money which it already collects from avgas and putting it back into that $25m; that is all. The Government knows that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To bring all of those airports up to standard and to keep the maintenance up, the coalition has made a commitment based on the community service obligation to ensure that those airports keep up to standard and meet the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority. We believe that is very important for the total transport network throughout Australia. As well as the need to maintain and upgrade rail services, we need to get our shipping in place as well as our aviation. That is an issue that the Government is not addressing. But I will not continue that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are benefits also in the general area of Fightback which help the aviation industry. Bearing in mind that the Government collects a lot of excise revenue from aviation fuel, we believe that it should be putting more back into the aviation industry and also into the promotion of tourism. Tourism, in particular, is an area where the coalition has given a commitment to introduce a number of taxation policy initiatives, including reducing the overall tax burden and increasing disposable income by the lowering of personal income tax. That means that people will have more money in their pockets to go on holidays&mdash;to use our aviation industry to go to the wonderful tourist resorts that we have throughout Australia. Everyone in this chamber would recognise the impact that the airline pilots dispute had on the tourism industry, particularly with the reduced flights and the drop in tourist numbers flying throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package also makes some major concessions to the tourism industry and the aviation industry by way of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and the proposed abolition of the petrol excise and payroll tax. The aviation industry is subjected to all of those taxes. That is an added cost to the industry and it increases the fares. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT4">Mr REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Burke just interjected. What he does not recognise is the massive amount of wholesale sales tax that is involved in the aviation industry. All of its spare parts and all of its servicing attract wholesale sales tax. That will all be abolished under the Fightback package&mdash;the petrol excise and the payroll tax. All those companies in the aviation industry have huge payroll tax bills. That payroll tax will be abolished, and that will be reflected in lower fares for tourists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a faster phasing down of import duties on spare parts that might come in for airlines and the aviation industry. Under the Fightback package, there will also be an abolition of the training guarantee levy&mdash;which is an imposition of cost on the whole industry. There will be no further increases in the superannuation guarantee levy. There will be reduced capital gains tax, especially for small business and tourism operators who are dependent on the aviation industry to bring their clients to some of our better known tourist facilities throughout Australia. What an important role the aviation industry plays in that service! There will also be a review of depreciation allowances, and we will abolish the automatic indexation of excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of infrastructure initiatives, under Fightback we are going to accelerate and facilitate airport construction and improvements. We know that this Government has shied away from the third runway for what seems to be years. It is like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS> on the ABC: it just goes on and on. Every week there is another episode. I note that the honourable member for Burke is not interjecting on that one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your guidance. The coalition is prepared to have a go at these things, and we will right the aviation industry. As a very important adjunct of aviation, we will reorganise the Australian railways to increase their efficiency. I am pleased to see that at long last the Government has recognised that the national railways are a very important link in the transport system. I see the honourable member for Burke nodding his head to show that he agrees with that comment. It is important that we maintain the rail service, because of its links with the aviation industry and its ability to carry tourists to their destinations after having arrived in this country from overseas, and also for domestic travel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecommunications, a very important part of the aviation industry as well, will be opened up to full market competition. That is important in this country, because our aviation industry is dependent upon improved communications. We will also be pursuing an open skies aviation policy. We will ensure that terminal space is available on a competitive basis. I reflect on the demise of Compass Airlines and its resurrection under another name, and on the sad state of our country's aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has made a particular commitment to the full privatisation of Qantas. We would encourage the participation of the new airline which has taken over the running of Compass to provide some competition in that area, because the main benefit of the introduction of Compass into the aviation world in Australia was the substantial lowering of fares throughout Australia. More people than ever in this country decided to use air travel as their main source of transport during the introduction of Compass, with its competitive prices in the fare structure. The other two airlines, Ansett and Australian Airlines, were able to compete and meet those prices, and to provide, for the first time in many years in Australia, some competition in domestic air travel in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other benefit of the Fightback package that I want to mention is the benefit that would go to general aviation, especially the abolition of excise on avgas, which is a commitment which will allow a redirection of 27c per litre on business and 19c per litre on private aviation gasoline. We have had a very good response from pilots and operators of private airlines, and private owners of aeroplanes, who are thrilled that the coalition has given a commitment to that, because they believe that will be of substantial assistance to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition does not oppose the Bill, but we do have a number of concerns about it, which I have spelt out, particularly in the changeover, the phasing out completely of the ALOP and the bringing up of local aerodromes to the standard required by the Civil Aviation Authority, before those aerodromes are transferred from government ownership to local councils and local owners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On many occasions on the other side of this House today we have had a lot of grandstanding about how accountable this Government is. Very briefly in this debate I would like to point out the other side of the coin in so far as aged care is concerned. I draw the attention of the House to a newsletter which many of us would have received from the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd earlier this week. It is headed, in very bold letters, `SNAFU'. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HHCS continues in its pathetic bumbling tradition and creates yet further problems for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>It asks the basic question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why does Minister Staples tolerate his Department's continuing mess in residents' rights?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It then gives a very strong sign to its members, by saying very categorically:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do not sign the resident's agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal President of that Association, Victor Hawkins, in a letter in the newsletter said that the Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has followed a policy and practice since 1973 (when the then Minister, Bill Hayden, as a result of our agitations set up the first proper consultative structure for Commonwealth and Nursing Home Industry working relationships) of careful analysis of industry issues, and commenting and working through differences in a sound, constructive and objective manner at both technical and policy levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that, as you will see from this special edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian Nursing Home</EMPHASIS>, the . . . Department . . . has acted in advance of the completion of the industry's discussions on Resident's Agreement matters about a range of administrative and legal problems. No doubt the consumers and trade unions have been similarly side stepped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have become increasingly aware, over this past year or so, of a growing inability on HHCS's part to handle the many complexities of the aged care policies of the Government. The Resident's Agreement fiasco, dealt with in detail in this issue, is yet another example of how HHCS's Central Office in Canberra has lost its grip on so much of the Government's `reform' package.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that the Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regrets having to take the stand it has taken in this issue but until such time as Minister Staples can pull his bureaucrats into line and get some good old-fashioned common sense into the matter, ANHECA has no option.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to outline the Association's, it seems to me very reasonable, position in that it has no fundamental philosophical problem with the concept of the resident's agreement, although it does not consider it necessary. Mr Hawkins says that, since it is the law of the land and it is incumbent upon all of us to obey the law, we are compelled to go along with it, but only so far as the law compels us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then mentioned one or two other points of disagreement. In particular, he said that there are remaining concerns surrounding duty of care common law issues which must be resolved satisfactorily with the Association before it can accept the proposals and recommend that its members sign the agreement. He concluded by saying, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does Minister Staples continue to allow the bureaucrats to bubble along like this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When will the Minister take personal control over this continuing (and expanding) mess his red tape experts by their costly mistakes are perpetuating?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, Mr Staples, as the Minister responsible, are you allowing the mess to get worse and worse every time your so-called departmental experts touch the Resident's Agreement file?</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the 17 establishments for aged persons in my electorate I draw the Minister's attention to these criticisms and say to him that, until the matters that have been raised in that December 1990 legislation are satisfactorily completed, criticism will continue in this very important industry. </PARA>

I will be inviting him in particular to give thought to the future of Tullamarine Airport. As he knows, Tullamarine Airport is in the bottom corner of my electorate, and I take a pretty proprietorial interest in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Dubois)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The honourable member cannot revive the debate and refer to what has just happened in the House. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will restructure my remarks to make my point. I will now centre my contribution on the Opposition's Fightback proposals to privatise airports in Australia. I make particular note of this as it relates to Tullamarine Airport. Some of those on the other side of the House, some of my near neighbours&mdash;that may include, for instance, the honourable member for Bendigo&mdash;will be aware that I will be flagging my intention to tackle the privatisation issue as it relates to Tullamarine Airport very heatedly at the local level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is that at the moment Tullamarine Airport is undergoing a $250m expansion of the international terminal and other works at the airport and there are very major projects under way under the auspices of the FAC. People living around the region not only have their work but also their living and educational arrangements now centred around long term opportunities at that airport. Those people are entitled to know that social policy will take account of long term prospects and that there will be some consistency in those long term prospects. The last thing anybody will be happy to see is the airport being handed over to the John Elliotts of the world. I mention Mr Elliott because, as Chairman of the Committee for Melbourne, he has been spearheading the campaign for Tullamarine Airport to be handed over to private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say about Mr Elliott is that he not only rattled the Liberal Party, managed to rattle Elders and got the brewery into strife, but also rendered pretty irrelevant the football club that I support. I can tell honourable members that I would not want to take too much of political or economic advice from Mr Elliott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point: a very major change that has taken place in aviation policy&mdash;the decision of the Government to allow the domestic and international arms of aviation in Australia to merge&mdash;has very important ramifications and prospects for Tullamarine. As my colleague the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear) will know&mdash;he comes from Western Australia and, therefore, knows Perth airport intimately&mdash;people have to take about a 10-minute taxi ride from the international terminal to the domestic terminal at other airports around Australia. A decision to enable the coordination of the operations is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike in all the other cities except Melbourne. In Melbourne both the domestic and the international operations are located in the one terminal. It represents a very strong marketing opportunity for Victoria to present itself as the one airport where all these activities are integrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am just putting it on the record now that I am very happy about the developments that are taking place at Tullamarine Airport. I am very comfortable about taking on my political opponents in a debate about flogging off the airport. I am actually rather looking forward to the debate from those who would purport to sell it. </PARA>

At the most, she obtained one week in three respite. He cannot get into Minda. No-one will take Daniel full time. Because of the new awards, the Anglican welfare cannot take him. What is this person to do? This is what is happening to the carers of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recall something that happened in the last two weeks in my electorate. I had a visit from a mother who had come to me before and who has a son with intellectual disabilities&mdash;Nick. Nick is 17 years of age and 6 feet 4 inches in height. His mother is about my height, and she is about my age. He has got to the stage where he has started to push her around, and now she is terrified for her own physical safety. Recently she took him to the deli. When she refused to buy him the lolly he wanted, he kicked her and pushed her and she was thrown flat on her face in the deli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She has come to me on a number of occasions in tears and said, `I cannot go on. What am I to do? Will I kill him? Will I kill myself?'. Finally, in the last week before the sittings she came to me and said, `This is it. I cannot take it any longer. I am going to leave my son at Minda', where he is at the moment. I agreed to act as a go-between for this woman because she said she could not face the pressure that was put on her each time to take back her son. She refused to answer her phone, and everyone who wanted to speak to her had to go through my office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the problem of the people at Minda; it is a private organisation. I might say it is an organisation that is decried by the current philosophy, which is very anti-institution. Yet when it comes to a problem, the Government goes running to this institution and says, `Can you help? Can you find a place?'. It cannot. It was absolutely full up and it was trying to get Nick's mother to take him back. She refused, and refused to talk to anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is now that he is in another temporary place. There is still no solution to be found to the problem of what is going to happen to Nick.

It will be my responsibility to make sure that this woman is not forced back into a situation that she cannot cope with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to conclude with a summing-up that one of my constituents made; however, I cannot find it.

So my advice to the honourable member is to go to the shadow Minister who has responsibility for that matters that she drew to the attention of the House and see if she can get a commitment from him that, should the Opposition become the Government, it will do something about them. She should do that before coming in here and criticising this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to speak very briefly on the impact of the GST. The Women's Electoral Lobby put out a document yesterday which has come into my possession. I think every member of Caucus received one. Thank goodness for that! It makes very interesting reading. The women of Brisbane went out and actually had a look at the impact that a tax of this kind will have on them and their families. I have not picked out any page in particular, but there are a number of them. For instance, I have opened it up at page 10. Under `Bathroom fittings', an acrylic bath Alpha, 1,500 millimetres, goes from $158 to $269 under the GST. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister for small business, housing and Customs interjects with that familiar Liberal line, `But of course, we will take the wholesale tax off'. It has already been taken off. These calculations have been passed by the University of Queensland. Just about everything mentioned in this paper which is commonly bought by women will cost more under the goods and services tax. For instance, as to bedspreads, the budget type, which only costs $59 now, will cost $63.76. A Sunbeam single electric blanket goes from $69 to $74. There are a few decreases, and let me just read some of them out. There is a 30-centimetre plastic ruler, which goes from 42c to 41c under the Opposition's proposal. That is a big saving! That is a big one for the punters out there in voter land.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Brisbane City Council bus fares go up 20c under GST. The paper that is thrown on the lawn goes up 15 per cent. With regard to women's clothing, I think a previous speaker mentioned a bra. Obviously she expanded that a bit. She said that the impact of the GST would be far less, but what was found in Brisbane was that it went from $8 to $9.20. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that absolutely amazes me about the whole debate is the National Party. It says that it represents people in the country. It knows that the GST goes on the retail price of the article. Everybody knows that the retail price of any article or service in the country is more than it is in the city. So the question we have to pose to the National Party is: why would it support a tax like this when it knows that, for the same article, people in the country will be paying a higher tax on it than people in the city? We really have to wonder if the National Party does have the interests of country people at heart when, with this tax, it will subject them to paying higher taxes than city people pay. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The submission goes on to say that the travelling time from Gippsland to an ATO office is 4 1/2 hours, whereas the maximum travelling time from any other Victorian centre to an existing office is three hours. On the grounds of equity and efficiency, a very simple but eloquent submission was put to the Taxation Office. But, surprise, surprise, the reply we got back on 21 April this year states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you may be aware, the ATO is currently undertaking a major program of decentralisation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is to be congratulated for that. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This program, which is now well advanced, involves establishing new "branch offices" in suburban locations in capital cities or in major regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no argument so far. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current round of new decentralised offices has been in the planning stages since 1988 or earlier and some of the new offices will not be established for three or four years yet.</PARA>
<PARA>It is fine so far. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last six months the ATO has established a presence at Box Hill, Moonee Ponds and Geelong . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It also states that soon it will establish another one in Moorabbin. Is that not terrific?  It is decentralisation to place three new offices in Melbourne, all in the 03 area code. What sort of nonsense is it when the ATO calls that decentralisation?  The letter then goes on further to give the justification for this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons for the establishment of the new Moorabbin Office is to allow the ATO at Dandenong, which currently services your region, to redirect its activities and responsibilities. This will provide a wider range of taxpayer services to the residents of Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA>How silly can one get? The ATO office is there. That report quite clearly states that it is not servicing the people. Yet the ATO goes on and puts one down at Moorabbin. That is not decentralisation; that is total bureaucratic nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who signed this letter, ought to be ashamed of himself for accepting such nonsense. I put it to him quite simply: we have a population of over 200,000 people; in the interests of decentralisation and fairness, I ask him to look once again at the situation and put a tax office in Gippsland. This would obviously create employment in regional areas, which is so important for women, who are quite often disadvantaged in these areas. I implore the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Parliamentary Secretary to disregard the gobbledegook that was placed before them and get on to genuine decentralisation and equity for my region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I give the House the benefit of my intended discourse, I want to say a few words about the contribution made by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus). She raised an issue which I think is very important to the quality of life for very many people; that is, how we treat the disabled, and particularly the intellectually disabled, in the community. The answer to the problem is not, as suggested, just through the taxation system; it is a philosophical problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem arises because many of the people in the welfare industry, the social workers, have decided&mdash;arbitrarily, I might add&mdash;that we should do away with institutionalisation and people should be returned to their homes. This is a very nice, tidy arrangement for governments, I have no doubt. But the reality is that there are some people for whom institutionalisation is the only solution. It is the only sane solution other than simply murdering them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we need to have a complete rethink in this area and that we need to re-fund some of the institutions which used to cater for these people. I have come across people who were previously institutionalised. These people are not particularly dangerous to the community but they are dangerous to themselves; they are incapable of looking after themselves properly. They now live fairly tortured lives in all sorts of cheap accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the cases that the honourable member for Hawker brought forward, clearly the quality of life for the parents who are looking after these children is abysmal. They are very often in a situation of terror and certainly one in which they could have no expectations of what we would normally accept as reasonable conditions in life. I believe we need to have a complete rethink of this welfare industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a government we have to stand up to the nonsense that is preached by many of these social workers and opt for re-funding some of the institutions which took these pressures off the community. In some cases, there is simply no humane or compassionate alternative to institutionalisation. Institutional facilities should be in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to talk about seriously head-injured people because here we have another case where I think governments act without a full understanding and knowledge of the situation. Many people who have suffered head injuries, mainly as a result of motor car accidents, are intellectually quite sound, but, in a sense, they are prisoners in their own bodies. They are locked in; they often have no motor functions; and we treat them as vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have them in C-class hospitals, which are fairly expensive, with no attempt made at rehabilitation. The rehabilitation is often handled by doctors who simply have no neurosurgical experience. They may ask a patient a question and if they get no apparent response, they then conclude that the patient is a vegetable. The patient is then put into an institution and virtually forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are entombed in their bodies for the rest of their lives. This is a tremendous cost to society, apart from the humanitarian angle. We ought to be looking at much more serious attempts at rehabilitation. Dr Newman, who has written a book on the subject, is one of the world's leading experts. His work has been recognised overseas but it is not recognised in Australia to anything like the same degree. I know that he approached the Government some time ago for a grant of $50,000 to codify the systems of treating these people and the rehabilitation processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have come to me asking what they are to do when they cannot afford to keep their child, relation, son, father or whoever at a facility where that person has made tremendous progress. We must look at this area from pure compassion. We must be prepared to look at giving these people a chance to lead some sort of normal life. In doing so, we will have a very big effect on the cost that is incurred by the state. If we can rehabilitate half of these people, we will save a lot of money, although I do not think it is the money that we should be looking at. I urge the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) to quickly assess the work of Dr Newman and fund the work on these brain-injured people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Travel contracts for each of the nine `Blocks' were negotiated by the APS Travel Review Team through the Department of Administrative Services.  Under the `Block' arrangements all contracts were for the provision of travel services as a travel agent and not as a carrier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(b)-(d) The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect data on the number of retrenchments from the Textile, Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industries.  However, as part of the overall TCF Plan introduced in 1988, the Department of Employment, Education and Training provides special assistance to displaced TCF employees.  Part of this program involves the notification of retrenchments to the CES.  The Office of Labour Market adjustment has provided the following information on notified retrenchments for the period 1989 to 1991.  Footwear had a total of 2,296, clothing 7,697 and textiles industries 3,909.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Information is not available to the Government that would allow data on the cause of retrenchments to be disaggregated in the manner proposed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 imported cars held 24.3% of the Australian new car sales.  The market share of imports rose to 31% in 1991.  In the first quarter of 1992, imports took 39% of the new car market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the TCF industries the appropriate Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for 1990/91 are not yet available.  Nevertheless, imports as a percentage of the total Australian TCF market went from 33.0% in 1988/89 to 34.2% in 1989/90.  In the individual industries, textile imports decreased their share from 52.1% in 1988/89 to 48.8% in 1989/90 while clothing and footwear imports increased from 18.2% to 22.7% over the same period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The NRC is currently developing its first Corporate Plan, which will address, among other things, productivity improvements.  However, the </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">productivity improvement benchmarks used in financial modelling to test the commercial viability of the National Rail Corporation (NRC) are set out in the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force Report of 21 March 1991. They are:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) - (d)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A definite answer to this question can only be made by each of the systems which have the detailed information on current, and prospective, performance.  However, it would seem reasonable to expect that productivity improvements would vary between systems.  As indicated by the Industry Commission in its recent report on the Rail Industry, not all systems are currently performing to the same efficiency standard.  (This is referred to in Chapter 2 of the Industry Commission Report, and in Appendices C, D and E.) Furthermore, State systems may not be able to achieve the same degree of productivity gains available to a national system operator because they are artificially constrained in their operations by State borders.  To illustrate by one example, this factor may prevent full advantage to be taken of crew rostering improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The NRC is presently discussing an enterprise agreement with the ACTU and the rail unions.  These discussions are not yet finalised.  However, I am advised by the NRC that its selection and employment will be on the basis of requirement, suitability and merit and, all other things being equal, preference will be given to the employment of existing rail system employees. The implementation of the enterprise agreement remains entirely a matter for the NRC.</PARA>
