<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those honourable members present or watching the telecast of proceedings can see the extent of the documentation I have laid before the House today. The report's submission to the Senate by the Chairman on Tuesday predated the presentation in the House today. There were 1,031 submissions received by the Committee. The publication of these submissions, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reports in regard to the deliberations on them at public hearings and the report itself, containing 120 recommendations, are now before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my long period in this Parliament, nearly 27 years, I have not served on many parliamentary committees. I am not one who has the same high regard for parliamentary committees as the overwhelming majority of senators and members of the House have. I allow myself the luxury of dissenting from the general opinion on the worth of committees. At the time that this Committee was formed I was shadow Attorney-General and I felt that perhaps it was proper that I serve on this Committee. I have to say that it has changed my attitude to the work of parliamentary committees to some extent; not totally but to some extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Committee can be seen in the wide ranging recommendations that are contained in the report. There are, as I said, 120 recommendations covering areas such as&mdash;I am relying on recall here rather than reading from the report&mdash;the role and the effectiveness of the Family Court Counselling Service, Marriage Guidance and Family Mediation, disputes in relation to children, enforcement of Family Court orders, matrimonial property, the consideration of superannuation, the cost of proceedings, the adversarial nature of those proceedings, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Committee in the short period of time that it functioned was, quite frankly, prodigious. In an area such as this, where different people may be thought to bring different views to bear on the institution of marriage, it has produced a report that is endorsed by all members of the Committee, with only three elements dissented to by one senator, namely, Senator Spindler. It became apparent to me that all members of the Committee approached their work with great diligence and with a very heavy presumption in favour of the institution of marriage, and with the aim to see that those who go through the tragedy of marriage breakdown are given consideration. Some of the Committee members have experienced that, whereas others have had the tragedies played out before them in their electorate offices, because there are very few areas of government jurisdiction on which members of parliament, certainly members of the House of Representatives, receive more representations alleging unfair or inequitable treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was extremely impressed with the way in which Committee members approached their tasks. I was more impressed, if I may say so to members of the Government, with the work of the Chairman, Senator McKiernan. Prior to this Committee inquiry, I knew of Senator McKiernan and his well honed leftist views. I knew of him also because of the slightly different order of clothing that he tends to wear, in terms of its colour and design. But I have to say that I have not been more impressed with the diligence, the fairness and the objectivity of any member of parliament in approaching a task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my colleagues practised in the field of family law prior to entering this Parliament, and halfway through the deliberations of this Committee he remarked to me that even by that stage Senator McKiernan was so on top of matters relating to the Family Law Act that his knowledge would have exceeded that of most practitioners in the field. I would affirm that. That knowledge, together with the fairness and the objectivity with which the Committee's hearings were conducted, meant that it was a distinct pleasure to work with Senator McKiernan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it unlikely that the Government will be returned at the next election. I am probably not doing Senator McKiernan any service by saying this, but I think if the Opposition were to lose the next election and Senator McKiernan were not a member of the Ministry then the Government would be flawed as a consequence. That probably means the end of Senator McKiernan's chances!</PARA>

I took a leaf out of the book of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who was speculating the other day on the woes that would befall Australia&mdash;babies would be bitten and the plague would descend upon us&mdash;if the Opposition were elected to government. It is quite clear that it is possible to propagate the hypothetical in this arena. My own confidence in the election of the Opposition is not diminished by anything I have said about Senator McKiernan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Committee too have worked assiduously. We would not have had this report had it not been for Senator Brownhill. He pressed for the establishment of a committee and, as a result of his efforts, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act was established. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) brought faith and diligence to his work, and my fellow practitioner in the law, Senator Reid, contributed so much from our side. They all made up a very effective committee, along with members of the Labor Party who, as I said, brought their own views to the Committee, irrespective of political philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the Committee were aided by a hardworking staff who dealt with over a thousand recommendations, with a number of changes in personnel. That staff assisted us greatly. I do not want to cover all the areas that Senator McKiernan has. His speech in presenting the report and the report itself should aptly stand on their own. However, there are a couple of matters that I wish to mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated the breadth of the recommendations that have been made and the matters that have been covered by the Committee. For example, the family law at the moment covers de facto property disputes where children are not involved. We have recommended no change in that area. But in other circumstances, where the Family Court does not have jurisdiction and the law is covered by the law of the State in which the couple resides, a number of inequities are apparent and there is confusion of the law throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended a reference of powers from the States to allow the Family Court to hear these disputes, but we believe that separate legislation should be drafted for these matters to be settled, and that they not be covered by the Family Law Act. We did that quite deliberately, because all members of the Committee believed that the section in the Act that affirmed the principle of marriage should remain, as an aspiration for marriage as an institution. We felt that matters involving de facto situations should be covered by separate legislation. All members of the Committee were in favour of separate legislation, rather than these matters being covered by the Family Law Act itself. We were cognisant of wishing to settle inequities by the reference of power from the States and of having separate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking as a lawyer, I was shattered by some of the submissions that came before the Committee with claims of outrageous charging by some law firms. We heard about some shocking examples of overcharging. However, I was satisfied at the end of the day that the majority of legal practitioners did not engage in such misuse of their position. We have recommended a new costing system and the greater use of costs orders, particularly where it is apparent that one party has unnecessarily prolonged proceedings. There are a whole range of matters on which I could speak, but I must allow time for other honourable members to speak this morning, so I will be brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to property disputes, we have made recommendations for special consideration to be given to farming properties, where we heard evidence of some frightful injustices. We have recommended that pre-nuptial contracts be taken into consideration by the courts in considering the division of property. There are many more points I would like to make. I enjoyed making, or seeking to make, a contribution from time to time on this Committee and I commend the Committee and the Chairman. I believe that the community, if the law is amended in accord with the recommendations that are down here, will have a better system of family law in a tragic area, which is made even more tragic in the midst of unemployment in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) for his remarks about the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. I would like to congratulate the Chairman, Senator Jim McKiernan, and the honourable member for Kooyong for their contribution to the Committee. Irrespective of the remarks by the honourable member for Kooyong about Senator McKiernan's aspirations, or deserved position in the Ministry, I believe he was a fantastic Chair of this Committee, and without him we would have been hard put to come up with the results that we have achieved. It also behoves me to thank the members of the Committee who worked with Senator McKiernan and the honourable member for Kooyong on this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a Committee of disparate views. I think anybody who has an understanding of the complexities of family law and the importance placed on the institution of marriage, and of the concern that exists in the community and in the Parliament about the rate and result of dissolution of marriage in Australia, would understand that it was not an easy committee to chair or even to be on. But the members of the Committee, despite their differences, brought to the report and to the consideration of the matter their very sincere and genuine attempts to resolve these sorts of problems in a most equitable and just fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report will allow access to affordable, just and similar law by Australians who are unfortunate enough to be experiencing the dissolution of a relationship or a marriage. As a Committee member, I wanted to be sure that the result of the Committee's deliberations would allow Australians to be treated equally when they happen to be in the unfortunate circumstance of dissolving their marriage or relationship. The children of the marriage are the prime factor and the Family Law Act recognises that at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee took great pains to look into the question of de facto relationships, where children were not involved, because these relationships and the property settlements of these relationships are not able to be covered, under present law, by the Family Court. We had long discussions, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Kooyong, about whether the matter should be put to the Family Court or whether it should remain as it currently is&mdash;with access to a separate court, the Supreme Court. The Committee decided in its wisdom&mdash;I think, quite rightly&mdash;that such matters should be considered by the Family Court, as it has the expertise to deal with them. In that way, people who have not been married, but who have had a relationship similar to marriage, will have their property settled in the same way as people who were married. I believe this enhances the institution of marriage, not detracts from it. I think it is a wise decision of the Committee and I certainly hope that the Government picks up that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some initial disagreement in getting to that point. However, I think we were all very happy with the decision that we would have a separate piece of legislation which would cover the property settlement of people who were in de facto relationships, as opposed to having that covered by the Family Law Act and altering or amending it to achieve that end. The situation of people in a de facto relationship is problematical, and we received very strong submissions on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in the matter of marriage dissolution is very limited. Fortunately, I have not experienced it; however, I am the product of a family that has had that sort of dispute. There are many people in Australia who have an interest in the outcome of this Committee's deliberations. I believe that we have brought our best endeavours to the report and that the report should be commended. It is a report of which we, as a Committee, and as a Parliament, can be proud; especially given that there was little dissent in the final recommendations and that those areas of dissent were fairly specialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern of the Committee was that there be a reduction in litigation. A group of people other than the marital partners being involved, especially where there might be monetary gain to be made by extending the proceedings, does not always assist the niceness of the result for the two parties and their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mediation counselling was canvassed considerably by the Committee and, indeed, by the submissions that were made to it. We have come down with good recommendations in that area. Most Australians will be pleased to have enhanced access to mediation counselling before making final agreements or settlements on property and even in relation to children. We have taken seriously the concerns of a large group of people in the community, including the male members of families who feel that they are not getting just access to their children. We have also considered the question of females quite properly. This is a good report. I hope and trust that the Government will accept its recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues in commending to the Parliament the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Family Law Act 1975: aspects of its operation and interpretation</EMPHASIS>. The Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act was faced with a very daunting task. I can only echo the sentiments expressed by other members of the Committee, the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock); and Senator McKiernan, in his tabling speech to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this Committee operated extremely well. Given the task, it operated certainly beyond my expectations. I did not think that it would operate this well or that the outcome would be so positive. The fact that there is only one dissenting report on relatively minor matters which do not take away from where the Committee was going&mdash;there was simply a view that some stronger wording should have been used&mdash;is quite remarkable. We had people from very different viewpoints, both social and philosophical. To draw all this together and to come up essentially with a unanimous set of recommendations speaks volumes for the Committee Chairman, its Deputy and all the members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to my election to parliament I was a solicitor, practising to a certain extent in family law. I cannot say I ever particularly enjoyed that area because, at the end of the day, I knew that the clients in a number of the cases would walk out from the proceedings extremely unhappy. That had a certain amount to do with the system and the law but, at the end of the day, we were talking about people at the low point of their lives, where the major relationship of their life had failed. They were in dispute, in many instances, about the custody of their children or about property that had been acquired over some years through joint effort. Inevitably, in those circumstances, people were going to find the whole process extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should bear in mind a couple of things and these are borne out by the report. Fortunately, most people, even through these difficult circumstances, do manage to resolve the matters fairly amicably. Very few end up darkening the doors of solicitors or the court in absolute terms and that is a very good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In as much as this report continues to emphasise that legal proceedings should, in the end, be a last resort, and that we should be concentrating on the concept of alternate dispute resolution, that is a very positive development. Ironically enough, it was really one of the founding principles of the Act. It was always meant to remove this conflict from the formal court system. That is why a special court was set up in the first place. Over time, I think that has been lost sight of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In as much as we have refocussed the attention on alternate disputes resolution, and canvassed the idea of including in the education system some better understanding of what is meant by a marriage, and given emphasis to the concept of marriage guidance, all these things are very positive. Inevitably, where disputes cannot be resolved, some matters will end up with an arbiter or judge having to make the final decision. We have looked at the issues that attract the most criticism and controversy regarding the operation of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of property, what the Committee has essentially done is return the law to the position prior to the High Court decision in Mallet's case: in practice, there should be a starting point of a fifty-fifty division of property, which can be modified, given the particular circumstances of a marriage, by means of a limited discretion on the part of the court. I think that people accept the principle that marriage is a joint partnership; that property is generally acquired through joint effort; and that a fair starting point is a fifty-fifty division, with the individual circumstances of each relationship then being taken into account. That is a very useful restatement of what I think should have been the principle which has become a bit clouded through some judicial decisions. That is a positive change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area about which I, as both a practitioner and a member of parliament, receive constant complaint is the enforcement of some court awards, particularly in the area of access. We have tackled how to make them work better, and I think the recommendations are workable and should be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of custody, we have again emphasised as paramount the interests of the children. We have made some changes in the way that should work, particularly by spelling out what guardianship means and what one can expect in being awarded guardianship, as opposed to custody, of a child. They are very important issues. I could talk for a great deal of time, but I do not want to take other members' time. I commend the members and secretariat of the Committee for a job well done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really cannot rise to speak this morning with any real sense of pleasure or pride or feeling of satisfaction. Having said that, I hasten to add that this has nothing to do with the work of the members or the secretariat of the Joint Select Committee. Both groups worked tirelessly to produce the report being tabled in this House this morning entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Family Law Act 1975: aspects of its operation and interpretation</EMPHASIS>. I commend Senator Brownhill; Senator McKiernan, the very able leader of the Committee; and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who also made an extremely valuable contribution. I also commend the other members of the Committee; the Secretary of the Committee, Robina Mills; David Wallace, the consultant; Fiona Taylor, who assisted ably in the running of the Committee; and, not least, Lesley Cowan, who very capably and ably assisted with the administration of the Committee, with the help of another lady in the secretariat by the name of Donna.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My deep regret is that we had to conduct the inquiry at all. The sad fact is that, every year, more than one-third of&mdash;or well over 40,000&mdash;Australian marriages end in divorce. That is not a very happy situation to be confronting this country. Many marriages which began with tender love and rich expectation now lie in ruins. Marital breakdown is always a tragedy: it contradicts God's will and frustrates his purpose; it brings husband and wife the acute pains of alienation, disillusionment, recrimination and guilt; and it precipitates in any children of the marriage a crisis of bewilderment, insecurity and often anger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am making a few comments about the sociological reasons for the growth in the divorce rate because of the very grave problem confronting us and some of the matters touched on in the recommendations of the report. The sociological reasons for the growth in the divorce rate are many and varied. They include the emancipation of women&mdash;a term I use very advisedly&mdash;and changes in the pattern of employment with both parents working. There is the pressure on family life exerted by unemployment&mdash;an aspect which is being seen to a great degree at present&mdash;and by financial anxiety. Of course, a prime factor is the provision of easier divorce brought about by the current Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, undoubtedly the greatest single reason is the decline in Christian faith in the West, together with the loss of commitment to a Christian understanding of the sanctity and permanence of marriage&mdash;I say that in terms of the petition in the prayer that the Speaker read this morning that asks for divine guidance&mdash;and the growing non-Christian assault on the traditional concept of sex, marriage and family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, I am very happy that the Committee exercised a considerable amount of wisdom in its evaluation of the whole concept of marriage. In section 43, the Family Law Act says one of the main responsibilities of the Act and of the court is to promote the good health and the well-being of marriage. That is why we elected to exclude de facto relationships in terms of property disputes from the Family Law Act and instead recommended that there be a separate Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very strong recommendations are made in the report for an increase in counselling and marriage education. Recommendation 25 is that the Commonwealth Government substantially increase funding for community education in relation to the rights and responsibility of marriage and parenthood, effective parenting, communications and dispute resolution skills, and anger management. These are all things that contribute unnecessarily to the huge number of marriages dissolved in this country every year. Research indicates very clearly that three-quarters of marriages that fail in Australia today do so because of benign neglect, not because of malicious intent, so the essence of recommendation 25 is very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Recommendation 26 says that particular attention should be given to the further development of schools based education programs which provide basic education in the areas set out in recommendation 24. The reason for that recommendation is that we know a lot of valuable instruction is given in the weeks and months prior to a marriage. However, the Committee felt&mdash;as many people feel&mdash;that at that time the couple believe the marriage is going to last forever; they are starry eyed and there is not a real understanding of the complex difficulties and situations that can develop in a marriage. The Committee is overwhelmingly supportive of the need for a lot more community education and for a lot more understanding of the difficulties and the problems that face people in a marriage. It believes not only that there should there be skills training in schools and a substantial increase in marriage education and marriage counselling but also that post-marriage enrichment courses should be available readily in our communities, not here and there spasmodically in different parts of the country but on an organised basis. That would give strong emphasis to the need to support the whole concept of marriage as a very rich union of two people. We hope that over the years such support will help bring a greater commitment to marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my deep wish and concern that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) take on board the recommendations of the Committee which refer to the funding of marriage counselling and marriage education courses. I hope that he will take special note of that and will not wait until the next Budget, and that there will be a substantial contribution made to take into account the dreadful effects of the high divorce rate in this country today. </PARA>

That is $3 billion; it is just astonishing.

Some parliamentary delegations every now and again experience hiccups due to the pressure of overseas travel but in this instance that did not happen. It was a great pleasure to have worked with my colleagues and with Bertha Williamson from the Speaker's Office and John Dyer, who both helped to ensure the visit was a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the momentous changes that are taking place following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the visit was really a great opportunity for us to learn about the history which is being made in both Russia and the Ukraine at the moment. During our short visit it was not possible for us to gain a complete understanding of the momentous changes that are taking place, but we were able to have many informative discussions with people who were very high up in municipal, regional and national governments, as well as industry representatives, in those two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention in particular a number of meetings which the delegation had with people such as the chairman of the St Petersburg Council of People's Deputies, the Chamber of Commerce in St Petersburg, and the manager of the Kirov engineering plant. At the Committee's request our hosts agreed to reorganise the program so that members of the delegation could lay a wreath at the war cemetery in St Petersburg. That was a very moving experience for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Moscow we had the opportunity to meet two deputy chairpersons of the Russian Supreme Soviet, including Deputy Chairman Yarov, who led the delegation from Russia to Australia a little over 12 months ago. It was a great opportunity for us to see the Congress of People's Deputies in session. Honourable members would be aware that it is due to meet again next week, when momentous events might again take place and determine perhaps a different direction for the Independent Federation of Russia. Given the momentous changes that are taking place in that country it was a great opportunity for us to see the Congress in action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an opportunity to see free speech in operation in Russia, with some of the deputies being quite critical of the Government and the operation of the Congress. There is no doubt at all that there was quite a deal of free speech in that chamber while we were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our visit to the Ukraine we had the honour of meeting President Kravchuk, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence of that country, and the Chairman of the Kiev Council of People's Deputies. We also visited an agricultural complex that the honourable member for Lyons might like to expand on in his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were in the Ukraine we had the opportunity to discuss a very important issue: the whole question of nuclear disarmament. At the very time the delegation was in the Ukraine, events were unfolding which allowed us to obtain quite important information about the future of the Ukraine's tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. We were in those countries at a very important time and I think those of us who had the honour to be part of that delegation learnt a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank in particular the Australian Ambassador to Russia and the Ukraine, Mr Cavan Hogue, his wife, and the staff at Australia's post in Moscow for their great help and assistance.

All the members of the delegation would like me to thank them for their assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the delegation would like to thank the Presiding Officers of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, Mr Nikolai Ryabov and Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov. We express our appreciation to them for their generosity and kindness.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to thank also the Chairman of the Supreme Rada of the Ukraine, Mr Ivan Pliusch.

I fully support his comments and wish to make a couple of comments of my own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was actually my first trip to what is known as the Russian Federation, but I had visited the Soviet Union some 18 months earlier. It was quite fascinating to see the changes that had occurred in that time. The great thing that we had the opportunity to see was the enormous drama of democracy establishing itself in a country as diverse as Russia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dobell mentioned that we visited the Congress of Deputies, which was something in itself. If you want to get a lesson in how to be a Speaker of parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker, I advise you to go there and watch the person in the chair. There are 1,000 members, only four microphones, and the Speaker has to decide who gets the call, as the members queue up at the microphones. The debate that we witnessed was the one on the naming of this new country, as to whether it was to be the Russian Federation or Russia. In true committee style they went for both: Russian Federation-Russia. They will, of course, forever be referred to as Russia outside their country, just as the Soviet Union was always referred to as Russia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch very briefly on a couple of items that the honourable member for Dobell did not have time for. The Russians were very kind to us. In fact, if anything, they killed us with kindness, and did not altogether understand that members of parliament want some opportunities for down to earth experiences when they travel. We were extremely well looked after. We were kept in a dacha which was in the complex of dachas where Gorbachev had once stayed and which included a dacha for Stalin, although he never stayed there. I was very pleased to know that, because it was an eerie feeling to know that there was a dacha for Stalin in the same complex. We travelled in the limousines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little bit of a nuisance because I kept asking to visit Arbeat Street. That is a very famous tourism street, but it is more than that. I went there more than once on the previous occasion that I visited Moscow and found it extremely fascinating and engrossing. It is a stretch of road for pedestrians only, with the artists and artisans of Russia, a very large number of whom are very young, selling their wares. The experience of walking along Arbeat Street gives an insight into the present temperament of Russia, particularly that of the young people, and into Russia's potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one member of the delegation who did something quite different. At a time when the delegation was fulfilling a very important engagement, I was given the opportunity of meeting the only woman Minister in the Government, the Minister for family affairs. A meeting was arranged, although she was extremely busy in the Congress at the time, and a number of women deputies also joined in. I was accompanied on that visit by Ros Burr, the wife of the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), and by Maureen Walsh, the wife of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). Both those ladies, who are very politically alert and intelligent, contributed a great deal to a discussion which consisted of very rapid-fire and very intense exchanges of information. Certain undertakings were made by me, on behalf of the delegation, to follow up the discussion in a number of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Russia needs a great deal of help in establishing itself, a great deal of advice, and a great deal of guidance, because it has been such a closed society for so long. It has not been open to outside ideas, and it is trying very hard to catch up with, despite enormous problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our visit to the Ukraine was highly significant. We were the first parliamentary delegation to visit the Parliament of the Ukraine. It was quite fascinating, particularly after Russia. We were treated extremely kindly and looked after very well. It was unfortunate that our visit was so brief. One feels that there is a great deal one could see in the Ukraine which would tell an Australian a lot about history and a lot about the pitfalls of the human condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank John Dyer, the Secretary, who worked hard, as he always does; our Russian hosts; and the staff of the Australian Embassy in Moscow, who gave excellent support and looked after us very well. I hope that our visit gave them some opportunities to make contacts and learn things for which embassy officials often do not have the opportunity unless they are with a parliamentary delegation. I would also like to thank the interpreters, who were excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank the honourable member for Dobell. This was as happy a delegation as I have ever travelled on overseas. It was a very happy delegation, despite its being a very strenuous trip. We had had 10 days at an IPU comference in Cameroon, under fairly difficult conditions, prior to the delegation going to Russia and the Ukraine. It was a long visit, and in many ways a very stressful one physically, but it was an extremely happy one. I pay tribute entirely to the leader of the delegation for that. I welcome the opportunity to say these few words on the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the previous speakers in thanking John Dyer, Bertha Williamson and the Australian Embassy staff overseas. In the latter case it was very reassuring to see their relationship with authorities in both Russia and the Ukraine at a time when the issue of Australia's relationships with the Ukraine are causing some tension in this country amongst the Ukranian community. It was worth while seeing that they had certainly embedded themselves in those societies, were recognised as knowledgable, and were respected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly thankful for the opportunity to go to the Ukraine. In the last census there were 4,000 people in Reid who defined themselves as coming from countries otherwise not defined, and 1,028 who described themselves as coming from the USSR. That description obviously includes a significant number of Ukrainians. The seat of Reid in Sydney encapsulates a lot of the institutions of the Ukranian community: St Andrews Church, the Ukranian Youth Organisation, the club, the women's hall, the Orthodox church in the electorate of Granville and another one on the boundary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That trip to the Ukraine and Russia presented me with the opportunity of raising with Ukranian authorities and the Australian Embassy some concerns of the community in Sydney, most particularly postal delays and difficulties in getting access to visas and fulfilling immigration requirements because of the need to visit Moscow. In the interim, Australia has established closer ties with the Ukraine. On the Australian front, Zina Botte has been appointed as the consul. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we visited Russia and the Ukraine it was a period of great tension, particularly&mdash;as the leader of the delegation mentioned&mdash;over the question of nuclear weapons and strategic weapons in general. In retrospect, probably things have not improved except on those fronts. We see a tremendous outbreak of racial and ethnic difficulties within the former Soviet Union. Some of the people the delegation met no longer hold the positions they did at those times. The Prime Minister of the the Ukraine and a number of the Ministers in the Yeltsin Government have been displaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is typical of the problems that we saw when we were there: the great difficulty of moving from the previous fairly tight economic restrictions to the market economy; the feeling that inflation is becoming a major difficulty for the people; and the question of distribution. The Soviet Union directed certain industries to particular republics, and now those republics that do not have those particular industries are dependent on others or the outside world. They do not have anything in that field. That is typified by the Ukraine's dependence on the Soviet Union's attempt to establish ties with Iran and Iraq in regard to oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters that we did raise were of concern in the international press. In the Ukraine there have been reports of a growth of anti-semitism and a concern about the future of the Crimea, and it was worth while having a meeting with the Human Rights Commission, which allayed a lot of concerns. It certainly conveyed to us the experience of the Ukrainians themselves within the Ukraine under the Soviet Union's rule, where there was not access to schools, there were no newspapers and there was a lack of language facilities. I think we were reassured that, despite problems, the Ukrainian administration was endeavouring to allay fears of the Russian population in the Crimea. Similarly, there were very real steps forward in regards to human rights, such as the question of religious freedom in the Ukraine and the possibility of people who had objections avoiding military service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that we discussed at length was Chernobyl, not only the question of the Soviet authorities covering up the dimensions of the problem but the very grave physical problems that people are suffering. We have recently had the advantage of both a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation and a business delegation coming to Australia, and it was interesting that the person who chaired the commission on Chernobyl stressed to Australian parliamentarians on his visit here their experience and their concerns with the whole question of nuclear development. We acknowledge that their operations are probably fairly backward by international standards, but it is a comment on the massive problems they are suffering as a result of this disaster that he did drive that point home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The experience of Russia, as I have said, was typified by the growth of inflation and the distribution problems it has. On a personal level, we were given examples of this by our hosts, people who were public servants, interpreters, et cetera, actually looking askance at the fact that we could spend so much, in their terms, on artefacts. To us, these were piddling amounts, very minor amounts, but they just could not appreciate that so much money could be spent on this sort of thing. This typifies the problems they have at the moment. As the price of petrol and the prices of a number of other commodities that have been controlled until now increase, there is a situation where their wages just cannot keep up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that struck me, particularly in the case of the Ukraine but also in Russia, was the desperate need to get foreign investment, to the point where I think we must have some long term concerns at the penetration and possible domination of their economy by other European powers, most particularly Germany. We have seen in Czechoslovakia the absolute domination of its economy over the last few years by German investment. But there was this sense in the Ukraine that, having abandoned the previous restrictions, needing to strike out and to be genuinely independent, it was, in my mind, perhaps going overboard. The people there had a view that the need for capital was so desperate, it was so necessary to get things moving, that in the short term they were not concerned about who was running the show, and that in the long term poses some difficulties for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to talk to Russian authorities about their interest in Australia's participation in projects in the Russian far east. I think it is fair to say that that was accompanied by great concern by them at Japanese possibilities there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thought that the delegation acquitted itself very well. Whether it be on the question of municipal politics in Kiev, discussions about armaments or ethnic problems, I think the delegation was very balanced. It certainly had the measure to cover all of those policy areas and represented the country well. </PARA>

From my observations, the economies of both Russia and the Ukraine have been desperately starved of resources over a long period of time.

We are conscious of President Yeltsin's program to establish Russia as a market economy. In my view, a whole new way of thinking by the entire Russian population will be required in order to accommodate a market economy. It will take at least a generation for that process to take place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I have pleasure in addressing the Committee's interim report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Counting the vote on election night</EMPHASIS>. The report addresses part of the Committee's current inquiry into the conduct of the 1990 elections, part 2, and the preparations for the next Federal election. The issues covered in the interim report are expected to come before the Parliament in the near future. Accordingly, the Committee decided to provide the Parliament with its views before the proposed changes came before the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reporting on the conduct of the 1990 Federal election, the Committee was critical of the time taken to finalise the House of Representatives result, which was not known until four days after the election. The Committee made several recommendations aimed at speeding up the House of Representatives result, including better access for scrutineers to monitor the preferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In responding to this recommendation, the Australian Electoral Commission has proposed a provisional two-candidate preferred distribution to be conducted by polling officials in each polling place on election night. Honourable members will recall that a Bill for an Act to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918 was introduced in the Senate on 15 October this year. Clause 22 of the Bill deals with the scrutiny of votes in the House of Representatives elections. An addition to section 274 of the principal Act is proposed to provide for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a scrutiny of such preferences (other than first preferences), on such of the ballot-papers, as are required by the direction . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This allows for the provisional two-candidate preferred distribution if so directed by the Australian Electoral Officer for the State or Territory. No details are provided in the Bill regarding how this is to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the new election night procedure were provided in three submissions from the Australian Electoral Commission. Certain aspects of the procedures caused some concern, including proposals for transmitting the result, the process of identifying the candidates to receive provisional preferences, and access for scrutineers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to transmitting the House of Representatives results, the AEC's original preferred position was to hold the results of the primary count until the two-candidate preferred result was available. The two results were to be transmitted at the same time to the national tally room, thereby providing a final and more accurate result than could be achieved using the previous procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While welcoming the promise of a more accurate result on polling night, the Committee could see no reason for creating a nexus between the primary vote result and the two-candidate preferred result. This topic was explored at length in two public hearings, during which the Committee took evidence from AEC officials regarding the arguments for creating the nexus. The Committee was not convinced that there was any good reason for holding back the results of the primary count. In fact, there is an expectation, reasonably held, by the public and candidates that results will be broadcast as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Committee has set out in some detail its recommendations for counting the vote and transmitting the results. The procedures described involve transmitting the primary vote results on a booth by booth basis as soon as they are available, and sending the two-candidate preferred results in three batches, also identifying booths. We recommend that, while the two-candidate preferred distribution is being conducted, other polling officials will conduct a Senate count which should be transmitted to the national tally room on completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedures which we have outlined in this report accord with the AEC's submission No. 26, which is a letter from the AEC dated 12 November. I also add that the net result of these arrangements will ensure a very speedy dispatch of the primary vote, followed by the two-party preferred or two-candidate preferred vote being transmitted when the tally in each division reaches approximately 10 per cent, then 40 per cent, and the final or nearly final figures for the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the recommended procedures, together with the advances made in computerised divisional offices, will provide a more accurate result on election night than has ever been possible. Not only will there be a more accurate decision by the end of counting on the night, but the advances should also facilitate the earliest possible transmission of a primary vote; so that, in 1993, Australian electors will have quicker advice of the primary vote than was the case in 1990 or, for that matter, in any previous election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has visited the Australian Electoral Commission and inspected the computer screens that will be available in the national tally room on polling night. The program prepared by the AEC provides a great deal of information. Commentators on the night will have available a most powerful inquiry tool, if they take the time to study the program devised by the AEC. On another matter, because the Australian Electoral Commission is to conduct an actual, albeit provisional, distribution of preferences on a two-candidate preferred basis on polling night, it will be necessary for two candidates to be identified before this exercise can commence. This is a departure from previous elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements raise the question of how the two preferred candidates are to be selected, and what the political consequences of such a selection process might be. The Committee was concerned about an apparent imprimatur being bestowed on these two candidates by the AEC. Such a situation is incompatible with the AEC's need to not only be impartial but to be seen to be impartial. In addition, an apparent nod from the AEC might be open to political abuse and could, in an extreme situation, affect the outcome. The Committee has addressed these problems by recommending that the selection be based on all relevant objective data, and that the identities of the two candidates for each division be kept confidential until the close of voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim report also deals with access for scrutineers in polling places. This is a topic which will interest all honourable members in this place. In the Committee's view, scrutineers should be recognised by polling officials as having an important part in the democratic process, and we have recommended that all officials be made aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee wishes to thank the Australian Electoral Commission officers for their advice on the technicalities of the election night system, and for their willingness to consider the Committee's concerns in relation to the planned procedures. I am pleased that a number of those officers are present with us today in the gallery. We believe that the recommendations in the report will provide a more accurate result than in previous years, on election night, and will satisfy the needs of the public and candidates in the most timely and efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, as part of its ongoing review of the 1990 election report, will consider a range of issues which no doubt will touch on some of the matters raised by the High Court decision yesterday. Whilst that is not the subject of the interim report before the Parliament today, in the minute or two available to me, I will make a couple of brief comments. It is no doubt a question which the Committee will want to consider in some good detail and with some good advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are two aspects of the High Court decision. One deals directly with the question of office of profit under the Crown, and the other deals with the question of dual citizenship. I must say that, having had an initial reading of the judgment, the decisions concerning office of profit under the Crown come as no great surprise. Many people involved in perusing this area of the law, or involved directly in its application, would not have been too startled by the findings of the High Court in that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is fair to say that the decisions of the majority in respect of the dual citizenship question have raised a number of questions and concerns. On reading the judgments, I must say that I was attracted to the views of Justices Deane and Gaudran and to their comments with respect to what constitutes a reasonable act of relinquishing a citizenship in circumstances where that is not able to be done. It is an important issue which is obviously very current. It will be given very careful consideration by the Joint Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I sincerely thank the members of the Committee for their cooperation in speedily putting together this interim report. The assistance of the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), and other members of the Committee in providing such a speedy report is appreciated. Finally, I give a special thanks to the Secretary of the Committee, Judy Middlebrook, without whose assistance it would not have been possible to compile this report. It certainly would not have been possible to have it presented in the Parliament in such a timely manner for the House to consider its contents in relation to the Bill currently before the Senate. I commend the report. </PARA>

It is very important for us, as a parliament, to realise the significance of the processes which we already have in place in this country to provide for the election of people to the Parliament, without too much rancour or debate. Of course, yesterday's decision by the High Court does put the focus on the importance of that process so that we can have good government, so that we can be confident that the people running this country have been elected by a very open process, and so that people are aware of the procedures necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I look forward to having a look at&mdash;as the Chairman has indicated&mdash;some of the implications, and at how those issues raised by the decision yesterday can be resolved in the future. It is important that there be certainty that any person in Australia with the right credentials can stand for election to this Parliament, knowing that there will be no backtracking in the future, as has occurred with the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary). If we can do that well&mdash;and I do believe it will be possible for us as a country to find a way through that, as we have with other problems in regard to electoral matters in the past&mdash;it will only enhance our standing as a free, democratic country which has officers that run the elections with objectivity and with a professionalism which is unparalleled anywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has a goal to ensure, to the best of its ability, that there is an outcome on the night of the election; that the job is done efficiently and effectively; that the Australian public is able to obtain voting results on the night; and that it is able to get that information as quickly as possible. It is important for members of this Parliament and interested people in the community to look at the proposals which we are recommending in this report, to carefully scrutinise them and to understand the implications of the comments which are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In putting together the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Counting the vote on election night</EMPHASIS>, I certainly appreciated the help from the Australian Electoral Commission officers. There are a few difficult issues to be resolved, partly because members of parliament are not necessarily technical experts in some of these fields. In a committee where members of the Parliament are seeking the advice of senior people in the administration of a particular department, it is important that there be a trusting and good relationship so that the information can come out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly appreciated the willingness of the Electoral Commission to work with us over some of those difficulties. There is no doubt that the outcome is a good one. It is a mark of the way in which committees should operate and senior people within the bureaucracy should respond and be positive about the questioning. I appreciate that and I think it bodes well for any future discussions we might have about yesterday's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report will give us a more accurate picture on the night. That, of course, comes from two things which are operating: one is the extra technology which we can now apply to the electoral process and the speed at which things can happen; the other is the change in the way the Electoral Commission plans to operate on the night. That will benefit those members of the Australian public interested in the polling results. They will get a quicker and more accurate picture by the end of the night than they would have got at previous elections. Also, those people standing as candidates and wishing to be members of this Parliament will get a much clearer indication as to whether they will be elected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that people look through this report. I raise one area where there is still some concern&mdash;that is, the two-party preferred candidates selected and so on. There is a need to be conscious that in some electorates there are three major parties&mdash;in some instances there are four major candidates. It will be difficult on the night to determine where the two-party preferred votes will go. I recognise that and I think many members of the Committee do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though this report has put forward proposals which will be beneficial in the counting of votes and which will give everybody a much clearer view on the night, we have to recognise that, in any close election, even these procedures will not necessarily tell us on the night of the election who the government will be; there are postal votes and other votes which come in after polling day. If it is a very close election, we will not necessarily get a result on the night. We all desire a result on the night, but that is not always possible. We ought to be clear that that is not the fault of the administration of the Australian Electoral Commission. We need to appreciate that. I do not want to take all the time remaining. I understand that the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) would like to speak for a couple of minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to commend to the House the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am a member of the Committee, but I know the Chairman of the Committee and other speakers will adequately cover matters in the interim report so I want to concentrate on the judgment of the High Court yesterday in the case of Sykes v. Cleary and others. I want to defend the High Court. Despite some criticisms from parliamentarians, the High Court got it right; anyone who reads the judgment of the Court will see that it got it right on both counts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regarding the definition of the term `office of profit', as far back as December 1990 the Committee produced a report after hearing evidence of opinions, dating back to 1909, that the Attorney-General had received relating to the matter of `office of profit'. Members of parliament were warned then of the minefield that lay in the definition of the term. Sad as it is, all the opinions really go to the conclusion the High Court reached that Mr Cleary did hold an office of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument really is whether the relevant period is the time of nomination or the time of declaration of the poll, and the High Court has decided, six to one, that the relevant period is the time of nomination. I agree with that and I believe the High Court judgment speaks for itself. It means that senators cannot remain in the Senate and run for the House of Representatives and then resign from the Senate prior to the declaration of the poll. It means that members of the House of Representatives cannot run for the Senate unless they resign prior to nominating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give a warning to public servants that their resignation needs to be accepted by the Governor-General in Council, or the Governor in Council as far as States are concerned, because their resignation is not effective until it has been accepted by the Governor in Council or the Governor-General in Council. I warn them that they need to dispose of their office of profit prior to nominating; that is indisputable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of citizenship, which appears to have raised the ire of a number of members of parliament. Again I defend the High Court. I can see the reasoning behind the majority judgment of Justices Mason, Toohey and McHugh, supported by Justices Brennan and Dawson, whereas Justices Deane and Gaudron come down in favour of Mr Delacretaz and Mr Kardamitsis and say that they took reasonable steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to bear in mind that we appoint judges to the High Court to interpret the Constitution. I am not on my feet to defend the Constitution: if people have got any criticism of the Constitution that is fine; I have got some. But it is unreal to criticise the High Court, the members of which have been appointed to interpret the Constitution, when there is no doubt that the majority judgment is interpreting what is in the Constitution. The majority decision has some difficulty on the question of citizenship. At page 17 the justices say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the critical words in s.44(i) do not permit this Court to adopt the approach which has been taken by international law. Here the question is different: is the candidate a subject or citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power? And, as already stated, at common law, as in international law, that question is to be determined according to the law of the foreign State concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, there is no reason why s.44(i) should be read as if it were intended to give unqualified effect to that rule of international law. To do so might well result in the disqualification of Australian citizens on whom there was imposed involuntarily by operation of foreign law a continuing foreign nationality, notwithstanding that they had taken reasonable steps to renounce that foreign nationality. It would be wrong to interpret the constitutional provision in such a way as to disbar an Australian citizen who had taken all reasonable steps to divest himself or herself of any conflicting allegiance.</PARA>
<PARA>What the High Court has basically said is that unfortunately in this case Mr Delacretaz and Mr Kardamitsis did not do enough. True it was that they took oaths of allegiance to Australia; and, indeed, at the time they took those oaths of allegiance during citizenship ceremonies they renounced their previous allegiance to Switzerland and to Greece. The unfortunate position is that the majority judgment of the High Court points out that in both Switzerland and in Greece there are procedures under which citizens of those countries can take steps to relinquish that citizenship. What they are saying is that people need to go that next step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is wrong to criticise the High Court in terms of this judgment in the way that some of my colleagues have. Some might not agree with it, but it is a pretty overwhelming judgment. What I say to members of parliament&mdash;and, indeed, to the members of public&mdash;is that I think the High Court decision is right. If people have got any gripes, it is with the Constitution. I want to state on the record that I regard this High Court as probably the best constituted High Court since Federation, but it is bound by the law. </PARA>

I note that it is an interim report, and I have had a conversation with the Deputy Chairman of the Committee about it. My fear is that in some electorates in Australia the recommendation of choosing two candidates will cause more problems than it solves. I hope that the Electoral Commission might take some advice on how it proceeds on this. Reading between the lines, while the Electoral Commission clearly was helpful to the Committee, it was a bit rigid on a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I instance my own seat of Moncrieff. There are certain parts of Australia that are genuine three-party electorates. When I stood for Moncrieff in 1984 it was believed that the National Party of Australia would win Moncrieff. My own private assessment of it&mdash;one that I did not discuss at the time&mdash;was that it would come down to Democrat preferences. In the event, on election day we discovered that the Democrats had given their preferences to the National Party&mdash;a subject about which I shall say more on another occasion, when I have the chance. That would have seemed to have confirmed that the seat would be won by the National Party. The early returns supported that. There were booths in my electorate that had as few as 100 voters and there were other booths that had more than 5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the first 20 or so results that came in were from the small country booths, and they favoured the National Party. It was when the results from the 5,000 plus booths came in that the Liberal Party won Moncrieff, and won it clearly. Those results did not come in until between 8.30 and 9 o'clock at night. I think it would have taken a fairly brave Electoral Commissioner to have said, `This seat will be won by either the Liberal Party or the National Party', given the state of the opinion polls at the time. They did not indicate that the Labor Party was in decline. There was, in fact, a 2 per cent swing against the Labor Party in Moncrieff when the results were counted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have risen briefly to say that I understand why this is an interim report, and I hope that a further report will come out and that some proper attention will be paid to those three-party electorates. They are not few in number. There are several in Queensland and several in New South Wales in the coming election. We could have a quite disastrous miscasting of results in cases where the preferences of parties such as the Democrats do not do what on paper they appear they would do, and it may be a close election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Government take action to ensure that all Australians have access to the Industrial Relations Commission to protect their award wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and I were driven to putting this motion before the House today by the scenes of mass protests by the working men and women of Victoria against the most oppressive anti-worker legislation that has been introduced anywhere in this country for many years. The Kennett Government, in abolishing award conditions, such as leave loading, and in destroying the award system has demonstrated a contempt for Victorian workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queenslander, it is disturbing to hear the Premier of Victoria embrace Joh Bjelke-Petersen as his role model in industrial relations. Like Jeff Kennett, Joh Bjelke-Petersen proposed the abolition of leave loading in 1987. Thankfully, he was removed from office before he could deliver on this threat. Another source of a feeling of deja vu is the fact that the penalties on individual workers of $1,000 and trade unions of $50,000 are identical to those introduced by Bjelke-Petersen in his continuity of supply legislation in 1985. Like Bjelke-Petersen, Jeff Kennett is seeking to brand the working men and women of the State as criminals. He is allowing to develop a situation where these workers face the prospect of a criminal conviction, if they dare to take industrial action against their employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jeff Kennett's legislation and the industrial relations policies being advanced by those opposite go far beyond anything that even Bjelke-Petersen would have dreamed of. On the day of that strike in Victoria, this House debated the issue, and once again those opposite sought to blame all of Australia's problems on the ordinary workers and the trade union movement. If there is one group in Victoria that is above blame for the problems faced in Victoria, it is the average workers in that State. But how did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) describe the 100,000 Victorian citizens who took to the streets in outrage at what the Kennett Government had done? They branded people as militants, simply acting on the demands of some trade union leaders. Those opposite are not really interested in genuine work place reform; all they want to do is attempt to blame all of Australia's problems on Australian workers and the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian workers and their representatives in the trade union movement have shown admirable restraint over the past decade, as we all well know. This Government's industrial relations policies are based on a principle that, when workers make a contribution to increase productivity and efficiency, they should be rewarded for their contribution. Clearly, with such a bloody-minded government in power in Victoria, the Victorian industrial relations system no longer provides workers in that State with adequate protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers and their unions in Victoria need every assistance to transfer, where possible, to a Federal award, to ensure that their rights and conditions are protected. I welcome the news that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) is in the process of preparing some legislative framework for this to occur. The Federal industrial relations system allows flexibility in working arrangements for both workers and employers, without reducing hard fought for wages and conditions of those workers. Of course, Federal award coverage would offer little protection to Australian workers in the unfortunate event of the coalition gaining office in this country, which becomes less and less likely every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies of those opposite represent a throwback to the master-servant relationship of the early nineteenth century. Workers in traditionally strong trade union areas, such as Ipswich and my electorate of Oxley, will be hit hardest by the industrial relations policies of those members opposite&mdash;policies which would result in lower wages and the taking away of hard won conditions. The policy launched by the honourable member for Bennelong amounts to a full frontal attack on the Australian trade union movement and its members. It strikes at the very heart of everything that the Labor movement has fought for over the past 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Liberal-National Party government, under the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), would be the most extreme right wing government in Australia's history, surpassing even the worst excesses of the Bjelke-Petersen regime in Queensland. A century after the shearers strike of 1891, workers have the right to expect certain basic conditions of employment such as penalty rates, sick leave and overtime for the hours they work. One hundred years after their political ancestors sent troops out with gatling guns against the working men and women in western Queensland, the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Bennelong are seeking to take these hard won conditions away from those workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback and Jobsback do nothing to create employment. These policies would only mean lower wages, higher prices and higher taxes for the average Australian worker. It is good to see that two honourable members opposite who are going to speak on this motion are from Victoria. The workers of Victoria will show them what they think of them in the next election, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy positively encourages employers to force their workers out of awards and to make workers accept employment contracts and substantially cut wages and conditions of employment. The Industrial Relations Commission would face an uncertain future under the coalition. The Leader of the Opposition favours abolishing it while the honourable member for Bennelong is cynically prepared to accept its retention in the short term so that he is able to push through cuts in wages and conditions. What does seem certain, however, is that the demise of the IRC would only be a matter of time under the Leader of the Opposition. The Industrial Relations Commission provides to workers in weak bargaining positions protection from exploitation, and exploitation is what happens if you do not have a decent industrial relations commission to protect the average Australian worker. Average Australian workers know that and at the next election they will be making it known particularly to the two honourable members opposite I mentioned, who have small margins in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition will probably not abolish the Commission immediately, it would certainly attempt to limit the role of the Industrial Relations Commission, undermine the award system, abolish national wage cases and reduce unions' ability to represent their members, which is a democratic right. The replacement of the IRC with individual employment contracts would result in a return to the atmosphere of confrontation that characterised industrial relations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The only way that many disputes could be settled would be through taking action in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To their credit, though, several major employer groups have already recognised the industrial relations nightmare that would result from this policy. The Metal Trades Industry Association has made it quite clear that it is opposed to the Opposition's plan to encourage companies and employees to move outside the framework provided by the IRC, as it recognises that such a policy would result in an explosion of legal costs. Bob Herbert, the Victorian Director of the MTIA, was reported on page 5 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 24 June 1992 as saying this about the Opposition's industrial relations policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The worst thing they could do now is remove the tribunal. This would throw employers and employees to the legal wolves. The inevitable outcome of moving away from a system of making and endorsing awards and agreements by industrial tribunals to one where `common law' agreements apply is to provide a field day for litigation, with the costs being borne by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite say that their policy encourages workers and employers to negotiate directly with each other, so that they can bypass trade unions and the Industrial Relations Commission. But under the policy proposed by those opposite the odds in such negotiations would be firmly stacked in the employers' favour. There would be absolutely nothing to stop an employer offering a worker a simple choice&mdash;either accept reduced pay and conditions or take the sack. Under common law, which would operate in the absence of an industrial relations commission, a worker dismissed for refusing to accept a reduction in working conditions would have no redress as this would not constitute an unfair dismissal. We need only look at what has happened in New Zealand to see what happens to workers when a central industrial relations commission is taken out of the picture. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Employment Contracts Act, the Bolger National Party Government abolished all industrial awards and established a new system of individual employees bargaining employment contracts with their employers. While employees are free to nominate to bargain on their behalf agents whom employers have to recognise, under the legislation employers are under no compulsion to negotiate with them. What sort of set-up would that be? If he feels so disposed, an employer can insist on negotiating with each individual employee. Such a system clearly gives the employer all the advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should come as no surprise to anyone that an analysis of the first 260 contracts lodged with the New Zealand Department of Labour under the new system found that just over half of the employees have had their ordinary time real wages frozen or suffered pay reductions of up to 30 per cent because of the abolition of penalty rates. </PARA>

Deregulation is really what our side of politics has been talking about now for a number of years with  respect to the industrial relations debate.

It reminds me of an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> some months ago, which said that Australia has an unnatural obsession with industrial relations in terms of the international debate, and that our debate has been unusually vociferous and unhelpfully preoccupied with the centralised institutional structures of industrial relations, rather than with performance in the workplace. </PARA>

The rest of the world is not like that. I defy honourable members opposite to read any of the newspapers or journals of all the other OECD nations or of our trading partners and find comparable rhetoric with respect to this matter of industrial relations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the New Zealand experience, despite what the honourable member for Oxley had to say, we see one that has been very positive.

The rest of the world has found other mechanisms.

It was a telephone number that everybody around the nation could ring to tell the people at the Council of Trade Unions these horrible stories of exploitation.

It was because today modern management knows that in order to be productive, in order to be able to export, in order to be able to supply the demands of people in the community for products and services it has to find a cooperative way to go about it. It needs to find a mechanism for sharing the benefits from the enterprise. </PARA>

Then he talks at great length about Victoria.

Even honourable members opposite would agree that the philosophy of communism is well and truly dead and yet they want to retain the worst of the system which utilises centralised prescriptive formulae for working men and women rather than allowing them choice. </PARA>

We have to get beyond that. We must work together at an enterprise level to bring some productivity to this nation. We must give incentives to people to establish new industries, new businesses and productive enterprises which will allow us to export, and to replace more of those goods which are imported today.

We remember well in Queensland that it was not until 1906 that the slavery system in the sugar industry was abolished. I hate to think what would happen in my area with the fruit and vegetable industry if unemployment benefits were abolished after nine months and people were working for $3 an hour.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are eight million people working in this country today, almost two million more than when the Australian Labor Party came into power. We have seen a reduction in unit labour costs of some 10 per cent. We are now leading the world in growth. We have the lowest inflation rate of the OECD countries. We have achieved the lowest level of interest rates for 20 years through cooperation with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and through bringing people together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Opposition ever gets into government and institutes its policies it will divide this community as much as the people were divided in the 1920s and 1930s. If it is a case of those that have and those that have not, then the price we will pay as a country is one that will take many years to rectify. What demonstrates even better the viciousness of the Opposition's philosophy is that not only does it embrace the Reaganites and the Thatcherites, not only does it want to throw the unemployed off benefits after nine months, not only does it want to destroy award conditions, but it then wants to put a tax on food and clothes, it wants to tax the kids when they go to the tuckshop, it wants to tax their breakfast, it wants to tax funerals&mdash;all at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the nonsense about low income workers being better off, the Opposition intends to reduce the bottom rate of tax from 21 to 16 per cent, but then it wants to put a 15 per cent tax on all their consumption, which basically means they will pay 10 per cent more in tax, not less. Every time any retiree takes his money out of the bank he will pay 15 per cent on every dollar that he uses. Even a widow who has to pay someone to mow her lawn will have to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the philosophy embraced by the Opposition.

Already we have seen Hammonds gaoled on two occasions in south-west Queensland for breaking the law, and those opposite and the UGA have praised him for breaking the law of the land. Worse still, in closing I would like to quote from the shadow Minister for social security, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 19 October as saying that pensioners should not have to queue up with the riffraff when they go to social security offices. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The opportunity is there for employees to deal with their employer if they so choose. The opportunity the Labor Party is putting forward for enterprise bargaining is there under our policy.

It is also appropriate today that we should note&mdash;coincidentally, bearing in mind that this motion has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for some time&mdash;that we have Dr Vesna Bosanac visiting Canberra. She is a noted ex-prisoner of war and survivor of the siege of Vukovar. Dr Bosanac is here to promote the cause of peace in her homeland of Croatia and to inform Australians of her experience during and after the siege of Vukovar. Dr Bosanac has already had the opportunity to meet this morning with the members of the Australia-Croatia Parliamentary Group. My colleagues the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who is the chairman of that group, were with her earlier this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bosanac has, of course, an amazing story to tell in that she occupied a pivotal role as Director of the Vukovar Medical Centre from July 1991 until its capture by the so-called Yugoslav army and Serbian paramilitary forces on 19 November 1991. Dr Bosanac had the task of keeping the hospital functioning during the 86 days in which the town of Vukovar was levelled by bombings. She is also here to appeal&mdash;and my motion, in part, makes a similar appeal&mdash;to Australia and to the world community to increase its aid effort to that particular part of the world. We welcome her and we trust that her appeal will be successful. She is a paediatrician, and her particular interest is in children. It is the children of this part of the world who are being hurt so much by the fighting that is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the number of refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republic of Croatia is around 230,000. Two-thirds of them are children. The need there is great. Already the resources of the Croatian Government are stretched to the extreme to handle these particular refugees. The need at this time of the year is even greater because winter is upon them. There is a need for food, particularly for infant formulas and powdered milk. There is a need for medicine and hygiene supplies&mdash;particularly bearing in mind the medical necessities for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The break-up of the former Yugoslavia, which we have discussed in this place on a number of occasions, has been a great tragedy. It has brought terrible devastation and suffering to hundreds of thousands of people. There are those who have become refugees or displaced persons and those who have had their families shattered by the death of a loved one or, worse in many respects, the death of a child. Ironically, I suppose, many of these people that the honourable member for Moore and I saw over in that part of the world just a couple of months ago must now question whether the iron fist of communism was better than what they have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the motion that I have had the privilege of moving here this morning deserves the total support of this Parliament, and I am sure that it would have the total support of this Parliament. Although Australia is far removed geographically from the part of the world we are talking about, I believe that we do have a legitimate interest. Australia is active in world affairs and is, of course, an active and respected member of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have substantial ethnic communities from this part of the world&mdash;Croatian, Serbian and Macedonian communities as well as some from many of the surrounding countries. I must say that to their great credit these communities have maintained a peaceful coexistence here in Australia, but that is not to say that feelings do not run deeply between them. Unfortunately, they do. I have in my electorate of McPherson substantial Croatian and Serbian communities and unfortunately they do not talk to each other. Personally, I have been able to develop friendships within both groups, but the Serbian community was naturally very suspicious of my role as vice-chairman of the Australia-Croatia Parliamentary Group. I have had no hesitation all along in supporting Croatia, in its move for independence and in its early days and troubled days, such as they have been, as an independent nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of the war in the former Yugoslavia for some time has been on Bosnia and Herzegovina. The London conference on the former Yugoslavia focused attention on this particular area and sought solutions to the conflict. Unfortunately, as we look back three months or so to that conference at the end of August, very little seems to have resulted. If anything, the situation has deteriorated since the London conference. My colleague the honourable member for Moore and I were in London at the time and we noted that the Prime Minister of Great Britain, John Major, said, `In this room are the people who can stop the war', but they did not and they have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, things have been made worse at this particular time of the year. Not only is there the fighting but there is now the inclement weather which is an integral part of life in that part of the world. There is an estimate that as many as 750,000 people face starvation. This is not famine ravaged Somalia in the Horn of Africa; this is the heart of Europe that we are talking about here this morning. The prospect for the people in that part of the world is starvation. We must question why this is being allowed to happen. As the Minister says, we ought to question it. This motion calls upon this Parliament not only to recognise the extent of the problem but to fully support the United Nations in its efforts to do something about it. In fact, it calls upon the United Nations to do more to stop the fighting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must applaud the United Nations for what it has done. The United Nations is stretched across the world in peacekeeping operations and aid operations and its resources are stretched, yet in an area like the former Yugoslavia we saw the difficulties it has operating where there is a full scale war going on. We have the United Nations protection force there attempting to stop the fighting at the same time that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is attempting to help the people. It is a very difficult situation, almost an impossible one. There is fighting in Bosnia and, sadly, even between the Muslims and the Croatians. Serbian forces have seized two-thirds of Bosnia, and the apparent falling-out between Croatians and the Muslims must place some question mark over the position of Bosnian President Izetbegobic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an international outcry over the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. The motion we are discussing this morning makes particular reference to that cleansing and calls upon us to deplore that. Ethnic cleansing is clearly occurring, not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in Croatia. We note that the United Nations has appointed a special commission to investigate ethnic cleansing, and to investigate the atrocities which have been carried out. We support that particular move and this Parliament will support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for increased aid is obvious. In some respects, the timing of the presidential election in the United States could not have been worse. Fortunately, President-elect Clinton has made some very positive statements about his attitude to a solution in the former Yugoslavia. We may well expect him to do more than President Bush was moved to do in the heat of the election campaign.

I moved a motion earlier in this House on Bosnia-Herzegovina that referred to the recognition issue and also to some of the questions raised in this motion. In reflecting on the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I go back to my visit to Sarajevo at the beginning of December last year. I attended the first national conference of the ruling Muslim party, and had discussions with President Izetbegobic. At that time, I became somewhat alarmed about the potential for a huge bloodbath in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In fact, I issued a statement in Zagreb, and when I returned to Australia, warning of the potential crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I said in that statement that political action on the part of the international community was necessary to prevent bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, we saw very little political action. There was a total failure of the European Community's political dimension to do anything about the Croatian crisis and the clearly bad omens about what would happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of course those things happened. The European Community has virtually rendered itself incapable of any hopeful action in relation to the matter. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned the conference in London. There was lot of optimistic talk at that. Mr Major made various pronouncements and various agreements were reached. The reality is that nothing has happened. If ever there has been a dramatic illustration of the failure of European policy, it is in this whole question of the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, the sadness of Bosnia-Herzegovina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen Bosnian refugees throughout Europe; I have seen camps in Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia. When one sees, as I have seen, what these people have been through and hears the stories that they tell, one wonders how far humanity has progressed since the time of the Nazis. There are terrible stories of atrocities. There are stories of innocent people being butchered, of groups of people being lined up and shot, of people being decapitated and of gross tortures. These things should not be occurring at this point in the twentieth century, and especially not in Europe. I do not think the plight of these people has penetrated sufficiently into the international consciousness. We ought to be doing as much as we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that honourable members from both sides of this House raise these issues at every opportunity. I recently went with a delegation to the Middle East, where I asked a number of questions. What can be done about Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are the Muslim countries doing about Bosnia-Herzegovina? There is a lot of talk. The United Nations has made a number of resolutions and tried to do some things, but it is not enough. The sorts of atrocities that occurred in March, April, May and June are still going on. Something has to be done about this crisis. The United Nations says it has many other problems to deal with and that it does not know how to achieve a political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is true that the kinds of solutions that were possible last year, before the outbreak of the violence, before the outbreak of the war, are much more difficult to achieve now. Finding a political solution is more difficult now because it is hard to get people who have been involved in the slaughter of each other to live together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a solution must be found, and we need to exercise a lot more effort at the diplomatic level to force people to the negotiating table to discuss a real solution. It is not good enough to say that the people in that region just want to kill each other. That has not always been the case. It is not true, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which, until the recent outbreak, was a model of the three peoples living together in peace and in harmony. Intermarriage between Croatians, Muslims and Serbians was at a very high level for three different ethnic communities. Yet we have a situation where that harmony has been broken down and destroyed by the outside interference of the Government of Mr Milosevic in Serbia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that I do not condemn the Serbian people. However, I do condemn the Government of Serbia and especially Mr Milosevic. It is about time Mr Milosevic heard the voice of his own people, resigned and got out because of his disgraceful behaviour, not only in this case but in Croatia and elsewhere. There could have been a peaceful, sensible dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, in the interests of Serbia as well as in the interests of Croatia and of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Instead of that, there has been terrible ongoing war. There is no doubt that the prosecution of that war could not have taken place if it were not for the huge armed military presence of Serbia and the enormous amount of weaponry which the Serbian Government provided to one side in the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there are forces in Serbia that are in favour of peace. A lot of the Serbian people have been killed, a lot of them have suffered, and those voices for peace in Serbia need to be heard. We ought to encourage a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina, whatever it may be. Some ideas have been put forward, of which the formation of cantons is one. Certainly, some way forward needs to be found for these people to live together, and for the sovereignty and integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina to be respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing things about all this has been the perception throughout the Muslim world that, in fact, because the Bosnian people are Muslim, the rest of the world, especially western Europe, has not been prepared to help them. Let us hope that there is no truth in that allegation; let us hope that it has nothing to do with the fact that these people are Muslim.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow on from the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). He is one of a group of honourable members and senators in this Parliament who for a long time have been calling for more attention from Australia and other nations to solve the current conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) commented, we have a most bloody and bitter war with civilians being attacked mercilessly by troops. We visited Sarajevo at the end of August this year and they are in fact in the hills surrounding the city indiscriminately firing mortar shells and missiles into the city at civilian targets. Probably the most tragic part of our visit to Sarajevo at that time was the visit to the children's ward at the hospital. In the intensive care unit we were able to see some of the terrible injuries that have been suffered by young innocent children. They have been hit, maimed, injured and killed by this indiscriminate shelling and firing by those cowards in the hills surrounding the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I find that sometimes our attitude towards this is coloured by what we see on the television. Night after night on the television we see these images of horror and warfare and bloody, bitter fighting. After a while we become a little bit immune to it; after a while it becomes surreal in its effect on our consciousness. It just happens and we accept it as being part and parcel of our world and, because it is so far away from us, it has little consequence on the affairs of our own nation. But that is not the case. As the honourable member for McPherson has rightly said, in the middle of Europe in the 1990s, war, killing, torture and maiming of innocent people are going on right under the noses of the rest of the civilised world. To be frank, it is a disgrace that the rest of the world has given so little attention and has taken so little trouble to try to resolve this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Calwell looked back to the 1930s in European history and reflected on the connection between the behaviour in the 1930s and the behaviour we are witnessing in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the moment. Of course, one can well ask, with the benefit of hindsight, how during the 1930s the rest of the civilised world&mdash;those that paid attention to what was going on&mdash;allowed the killing, torturing, maiming, aggression, invasion and occupation to go on unchecked, until in the end the world forces launched a war against that aggression and that uncivilised behaviour and defeated and destroyed the dictators responsible for all of the things occurring during that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention the children's ward because that probably was the most poignant of the various incidents that occurred during our visit to Sarajevo. It is probably the strongest image I carry in my mind from that time because they were innocent children. One child we saw there had lost a leg, the other had been badly injured and there were substantial groin injuries, all caused by a mortar shell. The child was five years old&mdash;the same age as my young son. When it comes to this level of violence, then the lack of attention and the lack of action by the rest of the world becomes a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday in Perth we had a very large function to raise money to send wheat and flour to Croatia to help feed some of the refugees who have fled from Bosnia-Herzegovina into Croatia. At this time there are 630,000 displaced persons and refugees within Croatia, which is just one of the neighbouring countries that has had refugees come into it. I wish to commend the actions of those people in Perth on Saturday. In a small way I made my own contribution of a tonne of flour. I would like to see that sort of effort expanded so that we can take pride in the contribution Australia can make to relieve the suffering of the people who have been displaced or have had to flee Bosnia and Herzegovina. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), but first I want to refer to a parallel matter. In a similar debate I made some comments on allegations of the Greek Government's perceived efforts to break the embargo on Serbia. As a result, of course, I received a letter from the Greek diplomatic representatives in this country denying those allegations and I do accept their word. Similarly, I hope that they can give great reassurances on allegations, not from Skopje but from a significant number of Western journalists, that their country's current deep interest in stopping aid to Serbia through blocking Macedonian access to the port of Thessaloniki is in fact crucially related to the embargo on Serbia and is not part of the campaign to deny Macedonia recognition by the European Community in December. I accept their word that they are not being systematically part of a process to aid Serbia because they see it as an ally against Macedonia and for other reasons. As I say, I hope similar remarks can be made by them with regard to this latest action against Macedonia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earlier speakers have accented the failure of the United Nations. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) made a very important point that there is a great danger in the Arab world, the Middle East, thinking that the failure of the United Nations, when compared with other momentous activity, could be taken as an area of discrimination as there has not been the same intensity of interest in solving this problem as has been displayed in other events. At the same time, I disagree with the honourable member for Calwell when he says that the Arab world has only been talking and they should be doing more. What are people saying the Arab world should do? Certainly, if it took unilateral action to send in its own troops the rest of the world would condemn that and I do not think that would really assist the situation. I do not think that the Arab countries are any more guilty than the rest of the world or that they can be accused of only talking, as the honourable member for Calwell said. In this country, we have seen great efforts by the Muslim community, Muslim Aid Australia in particular, in raising money and produce for the beleaguered people in Bosnia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion has a number of points, one of which deals with the question of ethnic cleansing. We would not deny that the actions of the Serbian army and of Serbian rebels in Bosnia and parts of Croatia have been horrendous. But, despite the unpopularity of saying it, I think we have to make clear that the situation is now deteriorating with recent activities by both Croatian irregulars and elements of the Croatian army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a report on 8 November in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manchester Guardian</EMPHASIS> which speaks of the town of Prozor. Its population of 15,000 has been forcibly reduced; 5,000 Muslims have been forced out of the town. At the time of the report, they did not know where they were, whether they would be shipped up the road or forced to run to the mountains and so on. But it was a clear indication that both Croatia and Serbia are trying to exploit the situation for their own advantages. The report says that as a result of this activity by Croatians, every window in the Muslim quarter had been smashed or machine-gunned, the brickwork of Muslim houses was blackened, and the sickly smell of fresh fires was hanging in the damp air. It refers not only to Croatian regular forces but also to those who wore identification related to the Ustashi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us condemn Milosevic; let us condemn the Serbian armed forces for the way in which they are handing over their arms to irregulars, to local Serbians, as they depart from these areas. At the same time, I think we have got to be very vigilant about not having a one-sided dimension to this debate, and I do not think that any of the previous speakers have. We speak of the arms embargo; we speak of a series of failed conferences, and a series of failed activities by the European Community and the United Nations. The ending of the arms embargo is, of course, one matter that must trouble us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House congratulates the Government on the innovative and constructive policies it has implemented to assist the tourism industry, including (a) increased funding of $15 million to the Australian Tourist Commission, (b) increases in the amortisation and depreciation rates applying to tourism accommodation building and plant and equipment, respectively, (c) the aviation reforms which are improving the competitiveness of the aviation sector and (d) the higher policy focus given to the industry by the creation of the Department of Tourism and the elevation of tourism to Cabinet representation.</PARA>
<PARA>Tourism is one of this country's fastest growing export industries. In 1991-92, it earned $8.2 billion in foreign exchange, more than any other single commodity including wool, wheat and coal. It is also a vital domestic industry, worth about $17.9 billion. Together, the international and domestic tourism industries are responsible for about 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product and employ 449,000 people, or 5.9 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the policies this Government has put in place, tourism will generate another 200,000 jobs over the remainder of this decade, or more than one in six of the new jobs created during that time. While other industries have fully felt the impact of the worldwide economic downturn, tourism has remained a strong and growing contributor to the Australian economy. Foreign earnings from tourism actually increased during the 1991-92 financial year by over 13 per cent on the previous year, and they now account for 11 per cent of total export earnings. Total inbound tourism for the first eight months of this year was 11 per cent higher than for the same period last year, continental Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia all recording increases in excess of that 13 per cent growth rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of growth has not occurred by accident, but is attributable in some measure to the long term support which has been given to the industry from this Government&mdash;support which the industry has, of course, duly recognised. Not only has tourism been raised to Cabinet representation status, but a series of policy changes have been announced which demonstrate the commitment this Government has to the development of tourism. This was made very clear in the release in June of this year of the national tourism strategy called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism, Australia's passport to growth</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is the first attempt by any Australian government to detail the role and function of tourism within the Australian economy; to map out its growth prospects; to identify those government policies which impact on the growth potential of tourism; and to outline medium and long term policy objectives that help to fulfil the potential contribution of tourism to our national wealth. Since 1983, the level of funding provided for the promotion of Australia overseas by the Australian Tourist Commission has been increased from around $10m to $76m this financial year. This includes an extra $10m for 1991-92, announced in the One Nation statement earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in that statement the Government announced additional measures to assist the development of the tourism industry or, more appropriately, to put in place economic conditions within which the tourism industry could thrive. These measures included an increase in the amortisation rate for tourism accommodation buildings from 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. This level of write-off more accurately reflected the effective life of traveller accommodation in a 24 hours a day, seven days a week industry. Changes announced in the One Nation statement to aviation policy also had an impact, and other reforms by the Government of the aviation sector have combined to produce a more competitive fare structure, with resultant benefits for the travelling tourist public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 Federal Budget, tourism was also recognised with a provision of $1.9m over the next four years to develop eco-tourism in forested areas and $6.2m over two years for the construction of cultural centres at Uluru and Kakadu national parks. I am pleased to note the $12m which was allocated to refurbish the rolling stock of the Indian Pacific railway, which has its headquarters in my seat and over the next decade has the potential to provide one of the great tourism attractions of the world, competing with the great railway journeys, including the Trans-Siberian and the Paris-Istanbul. This would take the form of a railway trip around the coast from Cairns to Perth, going through Adelaide on to the Indian Pacific railway system, which would be an enormous attraction for international tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism has also been a major beneficiary of the $350m local capital works program announced in this year's Budget, which itemises tourism infrastructure projects as being eligible, and these are being carried out in regional centres throughout the country. In my own electorate of Adelaide, where councils have received about $10m, a considerable amount of tourism related infrastructure is presently being undertaken by local councils, and last week it was my great pleasure to visit a number of these councils in order to hand over the cheques for the initiation of these projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that by the year 2000 there will be 6.8 million international visitors to Australia annually, bringing approximately $18 billion in foreign earnings into this country, and anything which jeopardises the future projects and prospects in this exciting industry are to be avoided. So it is with some regret that I have to refer to the fact that the Opposition is vigorously pursuing a proposal which could have a devastating impact on the tourism industry. Under the Opposition policy, every single tourism product would be hit by goods and services tax, which would be imposed on hotels, motels, domestic air fares, bus fares, rail fares, restaurant meals, tourist guide charges and so on. It is no wonder that the tourism industry has been up in arms against the introduction of a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, it appears that the work that the industry itself commissioned through Ernst and Young is being ignored, just as the recommendations of the joint coalition-ATIA committee were committed to a circular file by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Not content to ignore the tourism industry, the Leader of the Opposition took the opportunity at the Australian tourism industry national conference in October to berate the tourism industry for the quality of its submission, and to accuse it of being little more than a `vested interest'. What did the Ernst and Young report say that the Leader of the Opposition chooses to ignore? It said among other things that accommodation prices would rise by up to 13 per cent, restaurant prices by 14 per cent, alcohol prices by 8 per cent and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are also other implications of a GST oriented policy which the Opposition needs to acknowledge. For example, it is obvious that the coalition had not realised that jet fuel used by large planes in the aviation industry is exempt from fuel excise, making the GST rebate worthless. As a result, the tourism industry finds itself facing a 10 per cent increase in domestic air fares. To take another example, it is pretty clear that the coalition had not grasped the fact that about 85 per cent of tourism businesses are already exempt from payroll tax and so get absolutely no benefit from its proposed abolition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These oversights are regrettable, but perhaps more regrettable is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and his treasury spokesman have not been prepared to redress them. This is unfortunate not just for the tourism industry but for the economy and the country as a whole. As I have said, we are expecting 200,000 new jobs in tourism by the end of the decade. These are jobs that are much needed, particularly in an export oriented and very efficient industry, and that job growth will be more difficult to achieve with a 15 per cent goods and services tax imposed upon the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is with some regret that we find the Leader of the Opposition saying with respect to the industry that we do not want Australia to be, as he calls it, a giant Japanese hotel. No wonder that one of the leading lights of the Victorian industry, Ron Eades, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest concern of the tourism industry is that the proposed GST would be a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>We find such criticisms being made across the board. For example, the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia criticised the Opposition's proposed GST when its managing director, Len Taylor, said that ITOA would continue to wage its campaign against the proposal and would be pressing for offshore sales to be zero rated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents has warned the industry that the GST would increase domestic travel costs by up to 12 per cent. The AFTA chief, John Dart, claimed the tax could make overseas holidays far more attractive to Australians than domestic holidays. Also, the Ernst and Young report found that the GST could raise accommodation costs by up to 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, the tourism industry is very critical of this proposal. It is regrettable to see that an industry that has been forging ahead so effectively, and under our policies will continue to do so during the coming decade, should be threatened by such unthinking policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), with his somewhat superior intellect, could fall into the trap of just regurgitating the information that has been put out as government propaganda. I have to pick up his point about what was alleged to have been said in the Ernst and Young report. It is clear he has no awareness at all of the actual report. In one section of it, Ernst and Young admitted:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report does no more than analyse the impact of the indirect tax component of the `Fightback!' package. It does not take into account many of the other parts of the package, notably, changes to the industrial system, the effects of an open skies policy and the impact of the income tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>These three key elements of Fightback were not even considered. At the same time there is a Treasury minute of 27 November 1991 which estimates that significant savings will be made in various industries as a result of the Fightback changes to indirect taxes. They include savings of $376m by air transport, $361m by the entertainment industry and $318m by restaurants, hotels and clubs. These reductions in cost will have a significant impact on the tourism industry but these facts were not even considered by Ernst and Young. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the much vaunted ATIA report is concerned, it was purportedly to be a joint report with the Federal coalition. In fact, at no time did the coalition or its spokesman endorse the contents of the report. Further, the report did not consider many of the reforms that it had been charged to cover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback package does indeed offer a great deal to tourism and I ought to know because my electorate is very much a tourism orientated electorate. I refer not only to that part of my electorate which is located on the Gold Coast, but also to the fact that Mount Tamborine and a very substantial part of the Lamington National Park and the Lamington Plateau are also in the electorate of Moncrieff. It also spreads out into the hinterland and includes the very beautiful country areas around Beaudesert and through nearly to Boonah. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, tourism is a major issue in my electorate and one with which I am familiar. I wholeheartedly endorse the Fightback package and all that if offers to the tourism industry, a growing industry. I note also in passing, although I have not the time to dwell on them, the comments that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide, made about the importance of tourism to the Australian economy. I endorse those comments, and the Gold Coast is very thankful indeed for the rise in international tourism. If it had not been for the rise in international tourism over the last 12 months, the Gold Coast would have had the backside out of its pants because domestic tourism has dropped alarmingly due to this Government's policies. As a consequence we have very dramatic rates of unemployment on the Gold Coast, not all of which can be ascribed to interstate migration. I welcome the Fightback package because the abolition of the seven specified taxes will have a very dramatic effect on the tourism sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the Federal Treasury has estimated savings through Fightback of more than $1 billion for key sectors of the tourism industry. That estimate is now 12 months old. Importantly, the abolition of petrol tax for private users will cut the cost of petrol by 19c a litre. As we have said many times, that is a saving of $11 each time the average family car is filled. That saving will bring domestic travel back within the reach of average families. The general lift to the economy that the Fightback package will give will also bring back domestic tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, one has to at least look at the abysmal failure of this Federal Labor Government to spend money on roads, which are a major part of the infrastructure of tourism. The Gold Coast now has a permanent population in excess of 300,000 people. At peak holiday time, that population is increased by between 250,000 and 300,000 people. Yet the Federal Government will not spend the proper amount on roads for the amount of road usage, both on highways and on major road systems, within this area which earns major amounts of overseas income. This lack of money spent on roads also affects domestic tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback, business users will save 26c or 27c a litre on their fuel. That will have great implications for tourism for a large country such as Australia and, in particular, for a large State such as Queensland. A major Queensland coach company, for example, would save $1.953m in fuel taxes alone, and added to that would be a $100,000 saving from the abolition of sales tax on tyres and a $125,000 saving for parts and maintenance. So, under the Fightback package, that one coach company would save $2.178m in costs. Further, a Whitsunday air charter company estimated that it would save $67,500 on its avgas bill of $217,500&mdash;a saving of 31 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those examples of savings make a nonsense of what has been said about the effect of the GST on tourism. The savings for both domestic and international tourists on their costs in Australia will be enormous. The impact of the GST will be very small indeed. There are very few countries in the world to which one can travel that do not have some sort of consumer tax. Those of us who have had the good fortune to travel overseas will be aware that those taxes exist, but they certainly do not stop overseas travel from Australia. They are not going to stop overseas travel to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that are being proposed here in Australia are exactly the same ones that were put forward in New Zealand when it introduced its GST. However, New Zealand did not abolish fuel taxes, payroll taxes and all those other taxes. All it did was a straight swap between GST and income tax, and it has not had any negative effect at all on New Zealand tourism. The tourism industry there now admits that it was wrong in asking for an exemption. It accepts that the GST should be applied across the board, and that compensatory measures such as extra expenditure on the promotion of tourism are necessary. That, of course, is promised in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the great hoo-ha about hotel and motel accommodation is concerned, those hotels and motels would be free from the 20 per cent tax that applies to many of the items that they buy now. I heard a very misguided and, I suspect, Labor Party inspired person on radio talkback in Queensland say recently, `Ah, but the restaurants are going to have to pay 20 per cent on their food, and all these other ingredients'. Everything is fully rebatable if it is a cost of industry. GST is added and paid effectively only at the end point on a much lower cost base. Ministers have talked in Question Time about the cost of toothpaste, but they omit to say that it has a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on it, as do so many things, including the items that are required to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is essentially a small business industry. The Government points out, properly, that a large number of entrepreneurs in the tourism industry do not pay payroll tax. That is because they own `mum and dad' motels. They are very small businesses. However, they will benefit very substantially from Fightback's $13 billion cut in income tax, and other encouragements that will be given through changes to the capital gains tax arrangements and the superannuation arrangement. They will benefit enormously. They are suffering terribly under the capital gains tax regime, for one, of this Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jobsback package has been welcomed by the tourism industry. The voluntary employment agreements will make it possible to recognise that tourism is a seven-day a week, 24-hour a day industry, particularly on the Gold Coast. It is no good people talking in terms of the old 9 to 5, five days a week system. Many of my constituents welcome the opportunity to work weekends and nights. They are married people who take turns to look after their children and keep the home fire burning. That applies to a lot of other industries as well. Under Jobsback, Australian tourism will become more competitive, and that will create jobs in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be international implications as well. Restrictions on international tourist charters for Australia will be lifted to assist the growth to regional destinations and to capitalise on bulk tourist traffic&mdash;something that this Government will not consider&mdash;and foreign carriers will be licensed to operate to Australian ports provided that Australian carriers have the opportunity to take up reciprocal rights. That will result in savings in the price of international airfares of up to 20 per cent. So this nonsense about our turning away international tourists is just that. It is a heap of garbage. It does not look at the whole picture, just as the Ernst and Young report did not look at the whole picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be reforms in the structure of the bureaucracy, and we will upgrade the industry. Fightback has many other important implications, both domestic and international&mdash;all of which are beneficial, all of which I welcome, and all of which the tourism operators in my electorate welcome when they know the truth and are not fed the lies the Labor Party is telling at the moment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the motion before the House today moved by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley). The member for Adelaide went through in some detail a number of important measures undertaken by this Government to promote and ensure a future for tourism. It is, as he outlined, one of the major growth industries available to Australia. I do not propose in the five minutes available to me in this short debate to try to canvass those same issues, but rather to talk more directly about the impact of Opposition proposals on tourism with particular reference to Queensland, my home State and the home State of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who has just spoken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me, having listened to the honourable member for Moncrieff, that she seems to think there are three offsets to the GST impost on tourism. One is the removal of payroll tax. Let me deal with that first. She would know, as would all members of this place, that very few tourist operators in Queensland are of a large enough size to pay any payroll tax at all. The truth of the matter is that most tourist operators in Queensland do not now pay payroll tax. Most people employed in the tourism industry in Australia are not in a position where payroll tax is levied on their employment, so we should dispense with that from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of these debates where the GST comes up there seems to be some weight given by Opposition members to their industrial relations policy. That is a matter which we will debate again and again between now and the Federal election, and time will not allow me to go into it now. When we try to add up the figures, the bottom line of their argument is that the companies and the consumers need not worry about the increased cost that a GST might otherwise impose, because employers will be able to cut their costs. They will be able to reduce their wages so they will have a lower wage overhead. That has got all sorts of social implications. It might even have a few implications for the number of Australians who can afford to have a holiday, if in fact their policies were to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be recognised is the difference between levying a tax on the wholesale price and levying a tax on the retail price. The effect of the mark-up between wholesale and retail is generally accepted to mean that a 15 per cent retail tax is about the same as a 20 per cent wholesale tax. So in those areas where a 20 per cent wholesale tax applies, the abolition of it and its replacement with a 15 per cent tax will not result in any direct benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of optimism in the views put forward by the honourable member for Moncrieff and others opposite is certainly not one shared by the tourist industry. There is ample evidence of that. In fact, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Travel Australia: the Australian Tourism Magazine</EMPHASIS>, which is the publication that is the voice of the tourist industry, in August of this year had a front page headline which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tourism leaders slam Hewson's tax proposals as studies show cost.</PARA>
<PARA>It opened that article by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia has slammed the Federal Opposition's proposed goods and services tax (GST) which will apply to Australian tour packages and other tourist services bought overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>There should be no misunderstanding about the view of the industry on this point. The industry does not support the Opposition's policy, and that is well documented. The Opposition's shadow spokesperson for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) knows it only too well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just something understood by people in Australia. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of November of this year there was a letter to the editor from Mr Geoffrey Lipman, who is the president of World Travel and Tourism Council in Brussels, Belgium. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxing tourism, like taxing any other export, will increase its costs and reduce its competitiveness. Tourism demand is sensitive to costs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an international authority, warning the Australian people in a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> only a couple of weeks ago that we should not adopt a goods and services tax that would be imposed on tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland, of course, relies heavily on tourism&mdash;and so it should.

There is very little existing sales tax that goes into that by any measure, under any of the various categories that we are talking about, under any of the seven taxes. The GST will cost an extra $60 to $100 just to pay for one week's accommodation. If I am going to save that money on cheaper petrol that the Liberals say they will give me&mdash;although I do not have time to talk about the road user charge&mdash;I would need to travel some 3,000 to 5,000 kilometres just to save enough money to cover the extra accommodation cost. That is before I pay for meals; that is before I take the kids out for a modest dinner at the Pizza Hut, which will cost me an extra $5 to $10; that is before I go to a theme park, which will cost me an extra $15. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But when we are in government and Fightback is in place, there will be an increase in confidence, people will not be scared about losing their job and many more people will be getting a job.

Day after day the Prime Minister comes into this House and goes out to the television cameras and spends his time dumping on Opposition policies and on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). This is a Prime Minister who spends his time trying to divert public attention from the hard core issues at hand to issues of irrelevance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the Prime Minister has dumped on our flag, he has dumped on the Queen and he has dumped on our system of parliamentary democracy. He has had a go at the Senate a few times. He constantly spends his time denigrating the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith). This is an unelected Prime Minister who wishes to divert our attention from the hard issues at hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that it is indeed a litany of failure that we address today in this House: one million unemployed, one million Australians who wish to work, who have no work, who cannot find a job; 1.8 million underemployed, 1.8 million Australians who have no job or who have minor part time work or wish to find work but who have not yet registered; 375,000 individuals classified as long term unemployed&mdash;that is, they have been seeking work for 12 months or more without success; 600,000 young people with no parent with a job; one-third of our 15-to 19-year-olds who want to work cannot find employment; and 250,000 youth across this nation are classified as underemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we have to go along with this litany of unemployment and hardship? We have an international debt of some $150 billion growing at a rate of $1.5 billion per month. It is not as though we are saving. It is not as though we are creating new industries. We are borrowing from the rest of the world to pay our debts and to pay the interest on our debts while Australians lack work and business lacks any incentive to proceed to develop new industry or new products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have static or falling retail sales, and car sales this month are down again. There is a 20 per cent increase in business bankruptcies on last year, and last year was a record. There is a 30 per cent increase in personal bankruptcies on last year, and last year was a record. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 19 November says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a bankrupt was declared in Australia almost every 30 minutes in 1991-92. There were 16,780 declared bankruptcies in Australia during the past financial year, compared with 13,000 in 1990-91.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a record. There are record numbers of company insolvencies and we have declining investment in new plant and equipment. We have static home building. This is hardly a picture of a healthy and vibrant economy. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social security, litigation, bureaucracies, and charities are the fastest growing industries in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an indictment, is it not? There are many parallels between this failed Labor Government federally and the failed Labor Government of the State of Victoria. Victoria was and is bankrupt. The former Victorian Premier and her Cabinet lacked the political will to address the problems, and they were also constrained by their ties to the trade union movement, preventing them from taking the kinds of decisions that were necessary to turn that State around and to create a climate in which investment would be nourished and could grow. Madam Deputy Speaker, I recently received from one of my constituents a letter, a part of which I would like to read to this House. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Charles,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My husband and I were surprised and confused to receive a letter from you as a politician, who is interested in the opinion of the people in his electorate. This has never happened to us in the 40 years of our lives as Australians, and we not only appreciate your action, but feel privileged to, perhaps in some small way, have a say in the future of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We now realise our mistake and long for the security and continuity a Liberal government had given us over 30 years, and hope to God that our choice in electing you will bring some sort of balance or order back to this country, if that is at all possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The damage Labor has caused is criminal and unforgivable.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on then to deal with some of the problems that Labor has caused them as individuals. They end their letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite obvious to us that you would have to be a magician to correct the mismanagement of Labor, but it is comforting to know that somebody sincerely tries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you sincerely for this opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interest of Australia, we wish you luck.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia needs more than a bit of luck; Australia needs a vision&mdash;a vision for the future. That is what Fightback is all about, and that is what the Leader of the Opposition has brought to this Parliament. He brings to the 17 million people of our nation, employed and unemployed, a vision for the future. He brings a hope for an Australia which can employ its people, which is fair, which treats people equally and with dignity, and which offers a helping hand to those who are unfortunate, but an Australia which is dynamic and outward looking, an Australia which does not spend its time navel gazing and looking at the past, an Australia which sees a hope for a positive future, a dynamic and growing economy and a nation that cares for all of its people in all of their circumstances. That is what Fightback is all about. It is 600 pages of detailed economic and social prescription for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Government, the Keating Labor Government, has no solutions, no answers, no hope for the future, no prescription and no policies. This Government, tied as it is to the union bureaucracy, will never find the political will to look for the solutions that might save us. Every time it is put to them that there is a proposition they might consider which might help stimulate our economy, as was the case with the goods and services tax in 1985, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet are vetoed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The ACTU has the power of veto over a government. This is a government in partnership with trade unions, as the Kirner socialist Government in Victoria was in partnership with the Trades Hall Council. That partnership failed Victorians as it is failing Australians. It offers no solutions, it offers no hope for the future, it offers no vision, and it offers no prescription for prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come back to the honourable member for Dundas in a moment; I have a few things to say as far as he is concerned. The key point to be made in all of this process is that throughout this year the Government has taken steps to stimulate economic activity. The honourable member for Dundas has been here for a long while. He was here when the Fraser Government was in power. Whilst there was a recession in 1982-83, we had the spectacle of inflation running at double digit figures under the administration of the Government of the honourable member for Dundas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this process of coming out of the recession we now have, for the first time in 30 years, a low inflationary setting and a low inflationary environment. This will ensure that we move into a real, sustained recovery, built on productive growth, with the fundamentals moving; with a fiscal stimulus in the economy; and with the sorts of needs that exist in regions like western Sydney finally being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to contrast the approach of the Government&mdash;we acknowledge the need to rebuild public infrastructure&mdash;with the approach that the Opposition would take on these sorts of issues. Those opposite want to cut $7 billion from outlays. The very people who get hurt in this process of cutbacks in public expenditure are people such as those who have come into the Parramatta electorate after the redistribution of the former seat of the honourable member for Dundas. It is interesting to note the sorts of complaints we are getting today from people who live in some of the public housing in areas such as Dundas and Ermington in New South Wales. Those people believe, quite rightly, that the State Government of New South Wales has basically wound down the maintenance of the public housing stock to deplorable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of attitude that the conservatives of this country have towards people's housing and accommodation needs. Those people are basically told, `We're not adding to the public housing stock; we're not going to provide proper maintenance of your properties'. When people complain to me&mdash;I had someone from the Dundas Valley area complain to me last week&mdash;about the lack of action from the State Government about these matters, they are basically told, `You don't have any rights'. Perhaps they fit into the category of Dr Hewson's renters: they are not regarded as people who have fundamental rights as far as housing and accommodation needs are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely what Fightback is all about&mdash;completely cutting out public expenditure on key parts of our infrastructure, be it public transportation, housing, health or the various forms of social security. We have to ask what the impact of that will be. Clearly, it goes much beyond just the fundamentals of what the Fightback package is all about; it goes very much to the core of providing a decent quality of life for ordinary Australians&mdash;and Fightback is not going to provide any quality of life for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback is not going to do anything. The suggestion that by adopting Fightback there will be adequate housing for the people faced with acute housing needs, crisis accommodation and so on is just a nonsense. Anyone in this place who seriously entertains that proposition is clearly wrong. The position that we have seen adopted by the governments of both Mr Griener and Mr Fahey in New South Wales has fundamentally cut away at the living standards of people in our area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas is quite excited today. That is understandable, considering the way the Opposition is going in the polls. The truth of the matter is that the Opposition's basic approach to all these issues is that we can just have a contraction of the economy. I will mention what occurs, in the circumstances we have today, when there is further and further contraction. The people who get squeezed really hard by that process are those who have the least means to cope with that sort of contraction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation applies pretty much across the board in terms of economic activity around the world at the moment. Because of the depth of the world recession, governments are acknowledging that there is a need for stimulus, that there is a need to extend. Indeed, it is economically efficient to be extending the public infrastructure at this time because of the difficulties of the world recession and the way it is occurring. That is the practical value. Look at the United States, look at Japan and even look at what is being done now to try to revitalise the British economy: the model that the honourable member for Dundas and others have always said we should follow. Clearly, it has proved to be a miserable failure and, 10 years after it has been proved to be a failure elsewhere, the Opposition still wants to develop and embark on such a strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a strategy that is most unsuitable for Australia. It does the very things that are counterproductive to getting going the industries we need in Australia; industries such as tourism are vital to Australia. They are industries which the Opposition never cared about in its time in government but which have grown dramatically in the time of the Labor Government and they will continue to grow. Even the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), basically acknowledges that Fightback is a real lemon as far as the tourism industry is concerned. If the Fightback proposals are adopted, all that will happen is that the people in a position to do things to contribute to economic growth will be just turned against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points important to the economic recovery in Australia is to ensure that our banking system contributes to the recovery opportunities that are developing. I am particularly concerned, when we see the reports of the ANZ and Westpac banks, that we do not reach the situation where those banks do not adopt a strategy that encourages small businesses in particular to get funding to enable them to embark on new projects. I have had a number of complaints in recent days in relation to the actions of some of the banks and their failure to lend for new initiatives that businesses are wanting to take. It is very important that the banks, despite the difficulties they have encountered both here and in some of their international developments, do not adopt an approach that leads them to be too introverted as far as their future and their part in Australia's future are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks need to adopt a view which encourages a situation where they conduct appropriate prudence in their lending activities but, at the same time, they should not deter people who come along with reasonable propositions so that those people find that effectively they are starved of funds to conduct new projects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The people of Brisbane have been particularly concerned at recent attacks launched by the Kennett Government and people on the Opposition benches on their conditions of employment and their opportunity to protect their future conditions of employment. Of course, what we are witnessing in Victoria is a social laboratory which is part of the Opposition's Fightback package. The Opposition, on many occasions, expressed its commitment to the industrial relations package and, in fact, just after the election of the Kennett Government the Opposition's shadow spokesperson pointed out at the National Press Club that the Federal Liberal industrial relations policy was, to quote his words, `identical but for a few commas' with the Victorian Liberal Government's policy. At the same time as the Opposition is saying that workers should have no right to go to an umpire to settle their disputes, to have their wages and conditions determined; at the same time as the Opposition says that right should be withdrawn from all Australian workers; at the same time as its counterparts in Victoria seek to legislate to take away holiday leave loading, take away the loading paid for work out of normal hours, this Opposition has supported a situation in which corporate Australia has been profiteering during a period of great restraint by workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a couple of examples where corporate Australia has clearly gone over the top. It is interesting to note that in some of these cases these same corporate giants are the very people who find some attraction in attacking the rights of workers to have holiday leave loading or to have recourse to an industrial commission. A couple of years ago, when Elders IXL was performing at the top of the charts, in 1988-89 the Elders IXL board decided that executive remuneration packages should be increased. The board increased them in that year&mdash;only three years ago now&mdash;by 23 per cent. Total director remuneration for the corporate giant, in fact, rose by 10 per cent. Shareholders were rewarded with a return that saw the operating profit of Elders IXL fall by 80 per cent during the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adsteam is another example in the same period where executive remunerations were totally out of kilter with performance and with what was going on generally in the economy. At a time when Adsteam's stock on the exchange fell to less than 8 per cent of what it had previously been worth, its highest executive fees rose by 57 per cent. So at the same time as it was virtually wiped off the share register there was an increase paid to its highest executives of some 57 per cent. Its top director took a 53 per cent rise in one single year, and that took the top director's salary from $790,000 to a meagre $1.2m. Adsteam's total executive remuneration package rose by 34 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this occurred in a climate in which Australian workers, as part of the accord, were limiting their wage claims in the interest of Australia, to ensure that costs were contained and that inflation was able to be maintained not just at a level comparable with our trading partners but in fact at a level now lower than any of our significant trading partners. That sort of event has, regrettably, continued into current times. According to the latest preliminary information published by Cullen Egan Dell, who undertake regular surveys of this matter, in the year to September 1992 total remunerations for senior management rose by 5 per cent. In the last year, senior executives in this country have picked up another 5 per cent for themselves&mdash;at a time in which the CPI has grown by less than 1 per cent, at a time in which average weekly earnings have grown by only 3.1 per cent, and at a time when most of their workers, those people paid under awards, have had an increase of only 2.7 per cent. So in the last year, on the latest figures to September, we have corporate Australia taking unto itself double the rate of increase that is provided to its workers and now, championed by the Opposition in this place and by the newly elected Liberal Government in Victoria, seeking to take away some of those pre-existing rights and conditions which workers in Australia had enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long term executive remuneration growth in Australia still remains well above average earnings. Since March 1983, male average weekly earnings have risen by 75.2 per cent, while the base salary earnings for senior management have grown by 135 per cent. Again, executive salaries nearly doubled those of employees over a period of some years. True to its ideology and its concern for the rich, the Kennett Government has followed the same policy in practice. At the same time as it was abolishing annual leave loadings for State awards and ending penalty rates for evening and weekend work, it sought to increase ministerial salaries and, of course, returned the Parliament House dining room to the silver service arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of duplicitous actions do not go unnoticed by ordinary workers in Australia, and they have not gone unnoticed by the people of Brisbane. Having shown tremendous and commendable restraint for nearly a decade now in their wages claims, to ensure that profitability was maintained and to ensure that inflation was kept at very low levels&mdash;historically low levels for Australia, and by international comparison&mdash;the people of Brisbane do not accept the situation where the workers have demonstrated such a commitment to our nation and such a degree of self-sacrifice but, at the same time, corporate Australia has had its nose in the trough as far it could bury it in. Some executives have taken so much out of companies, including ones that were going down the chute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate Australia had no qualms in taking 50 per cent increases in one year out of companies going down the chute. Opposition policy guarantees them the unfettered right to continue to do that at the expense of workers, so that future wage increases for the executives will be funded by reductions in salary and conditions for ordinary workers. That point was not lost on the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, which published an article in April this year under the heading `Recession-proof executives win 12.5% rise'&mdash;and that is about right: they think they are recession proof. The article opened by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pay packets of Australia's most highly paid executives appeared to defy economic gravity last year, rising an average 12.5 per cent as corporate profits plunged and ordinary employees made do with an average increase of 3.1.per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> understood it. At the same time as profits were going down, and workers' salaries were barely rising by 3 per cent, what did corporate Australia do? At the top end of town, in the Rolls and the BMW, the people who went off to celebrate the first anniversary of the GST&mdash;those people whom you rely upon for the fundamental basis of your support&mdash;were taking a 12 per cent increase. Of course, the Tandberg cartoon is not bad, either. It shows the executive addressing the office staff, and the executive says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will have to learn to cope with less.</PARA>
<PARA>As they walk off, heads bowed and forlorn, the executive, with a grin on his face and a little idea in his mind, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as I've learnt to cope with more.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of Australia that the Opposition would have permeating the country, as part of its Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was sad to hear on the news, in the last 24 hours, yet another example of what seems to me to be thoroughly disgraceful actions on the part of executives and boards. Yesterday, I understand, Fairfax shareholders&mdash;and it is the shareholders who approved it, so I guess that the methods are correct, although I fail to understand the logic&mdash;approved the granting of a $1m dollar, interest free loan to one of the directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to wonder what the average employee of Fairfax must think about a company that is in difficulty, with workers whose jobs are threatened; workers who are told that they have to change their work habits and become more productive and multi-skilled, and that they have got to do it tough and tighten their belts. At the same time as they have got to do all those things, the old shareholders of Fairfax have said yesterday that they will give a $1m dollar, interest free loan to one of the directors. I repeat, a $1m, interest free loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that if someone waltzed up to a person in the street and said, `Here is a million dollars, interest free.

But workers do not get that opportunity, and it is duplicitous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is high time this Parliament established an inquiry into the level of non-award remuneration in this country. It is time that we had a close look at the types of remuneration, the level of remuneration, and the extent to which productivity and performance are linked to those payments. The Parliament should establish that inquiry. It is about time we started to put an end to the snouts in the trough, ensure that shareholders get a fair return, and ensure that some equity is returned to this country so that the workers' pain is not in vain. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sixty years ago this nation faced its greatest crisis since the divisive conscription controversies of 1916 and 1917. As the ravages of the world depression engulfed Australia thousands were thrown out of work, evicted from their homes and driven from their farms. A small army of unemployed tramped the cities and the countryside in a humiliating quest for handouts and casual work. Many of the problems now facing Australia bear a striking resemblance to the dilemmas of the Great Depression. Yet, in contrast to the 1930s, there is no world depression. Australia's problems are the fault of the economic vandal, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). In particular, the entrenched structural barriers that have so hindered this nation for almost a century are now widely recognised as major impediments to the national development and a return to prosperity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians, in seeking to insulate themselves from the rest of the world, have created a costly cocoon from which it is proving very difficult to escape. The concept of protection all round coupled with a pathological reliance on governments to regulate our lives and make decisions for us is not only unworkable, but will ultimately endanger the nation's living standards and its democratic way of life. Our cocoon will ultimately suffocate us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that government can bring about economic growth is absolute nonsense, he knows that it is nonsense, and most members of the Government know it is nonsense. All the evidence of recent decades confirms that the best government is the least government. President Coolidge of the US asserted in the 1920s that the business of America was business. That is a philosophy that Australians could well learn from. Calvin Coolidge understood that it is individuals with ideas and energy who create the wealth which underpins a free and democratic society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there is no doubt that government has to act to remove the negatives in the business climate, the emphasis must be on allowing free enterprise to do what it does best: create employment opportunities and prosperity. In short, it is not the business of government to be in business. At the same time, however, business must be prepared to assume a much greater degree of moral responsibility for its corporate conduct. There is no doubt that the community is sickened by the appalling excesses of the 1980s, particularly the more blatant instances of individual greed and dishonesty. It is my belief that the unethical and on occasions criminal actions of a few have brought the legitimate business endeavours of many into considerable disrepute, much to the cost of the entire community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In highlighting the barriers that we have placed in the way of prosperity it is important to recognise that it is the Prime Minister who is directly responsible for the recession we had to have, which is really the depression we did not want. No amount of self-righteous protestation, media lies or attempts to shift the blame to others will prevent his inevitable consignment to the dustbin of history. The bovver boy from Blaxland, the unelected Prime Minister who has thrown a million Australians out of work, is too much of a coward to introduce the structural changes so desperately needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the economic vandal became Treasurer in 1983, Australia's economic problems were severe, and our debt was just $23 billion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the whole nation must pay for the outrageous excesses of WA Inc., the State Bank of South Australia, Tricontinental, the collapse of the Pyramid Building Society and Estate Mortgage, and the tragedy of the loss of the people's bank, the former State Bank of Victoria. This was the bank that survived wars and depressions. This was the bank that enabled ordinary families to buy a house and to finance a small business. This was the bank that encouraged thousands of school children to open accounts and begin saving. The State Bank of Victoria survived for well over a century, but it could not withstand the assault from the Prime Minister and the former Premier, Joan Kirner. What had been built up over a century was destroyed by the Labor barbarians in less than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The catastrophe of the State Bank, the slump in consumer confidence, the serious erosion of State revenue and the mass exodus of Victorians to other States are all problems that could have been easily avoided. They have become problems requiring such drastic solutions that more pain is being inflicted on the community. This is a dreadful situation. In their failure to govern in the interests of all Victorians, Cain and Kirner took the soft option of always borrowing more to cover bigger deficits, instead of reducing wasteful expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, throughout its entire period in office, Labor was quite unable to surmount its factional pressures, personal conflicts and domination by the Socialist Left unions&mdash;in particular by the Stalinist standover man, the de facto Premier, John Halfpenny.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this dreadful situation are being felt most severely in my electorate of Dunkley. In its laudable efforts to rescue basket-case Victoria from the hands of the receivers, spending cuts have been made in major areas of public spending. It is a tragedy that these cuts include Aspendale Technical School, a school which draws many of its students from my electorate.

All this has been forced on the community by the desperate financial catastrophe that has bankrupt Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely acknowledged that for many decades Victoria has been at the forefront of technical education. Its technical schools, and the dedicated professionals who work in them, have made a major contribution to the continued prosperity not simply of the State, but of the nation at large.

Yet what is the response from the Prime Minister?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">J.H. Scullin, following his election as Prime Minister in 1929, was quick to recognise the enormity of the problems then facing Australians. In an address to this House in early 1930 he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member opposite commented, a very good operation. Last weekend's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> detailed another stage in the remarkable career of Bob Whitehead and his company, RFW Truck Manufacturing. Bob, having learned engineering in the RAAF, came back to the Chester Hill-Granville area where he had grown up in a period when it was still possessed of dairy farms and other semi-rural industries. Today his firm is the only remaining company in the Southern Hemisphere that locally designs and manufactures all types of transport vehicles and equipment. At its Boundary Street site, it is Australia's lone integrated truck manufacturing operation. It is fair to say that Bob and I have many disagreements over politics, and we may have different analyses of some of his problems. However, we are in accord about the urgent need for a government purchasing policy that re-emphasises the encouragement of Australian firms in import replacement, the twin to export penetration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a period of 50 years RFW has provided its product to the mining industry, Qantas, varied railways, the electricity field, the Water Board and the armed forces. A central focus of the operation is a production of over 500,000 parts. These are often the salvation of Australian companies that have otherwise become entrapped in the vicious circle of inferior foreign products that are unable to handle Australia's peculiar conditions. This dependence on overseas suppliers often condemns local purchasers to high price&mdash;ransom&mdash;unsuitability, and notorious delays in obtaining replacement parts. A team of engineers, blacksmiths, fitters and turners and boilermakers fashion these parts on the site. In the interim they have witnessed the decay and disappearance of many firms that had acted as their own local suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those decades, RFW has engineered an amazing collection of products. These include special purpose vehicles, all-wheel drives for heavy-duty operation, bus and coach chassis, electricity and council vehicles and garbage compacters&mdash;once again, these are all-wheel drive&mdash;and railway road-rail vehicles to run on multigauge rails, to name but a few. They are indeed a novel institution in this country. They perhaps had competitors once, but they have been wiped out in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the specific instance of Mr Whitehead's problem, covered briefly in last weekend's paper. It noted that the Brisbane City Council was about to take delivery of the biggest sewerage suction truck in the world. This suction equipment had been built by the Swiss Kaiser Sewerage Cooperative, acknowledged as world leaders in its field. One would expect that as industry leaders it would recognise pre-eminence in others. Thus, it was on its advice that the Brisbane City Council chose the Sydney based RFW company to build a massive 14-wheel, $2m all-wheel drive truck necessary to carry the new equipment over all terrains. </PARA>

He is an encyclopaedia in the field, and has an enthusiasm and determination that are inspiring. Recently he had a Unimog in his yard. It had broken a front spring. Mercedes Benz's most hopeful prediction was for $800 to give delivery of this part within eight weeks. What is supposed to happen to the company in the interim? In contrast, Bob had a local spring manufacturer make a couple very quickly, and had the vehicle back on the road within a week for the NSW Railways. `The local springs will out-perform the imported rubbish', growls Bob, `and they only cost $300 each'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another instance, the Civil Aviation Authority recently bought American airport fire trucks. Predictably, the Department never invited RFW tender. There are already problems with the brakes, which are hopelessly inadequate, and with the front axles, which are breaking. The sad fact of life is that the design quality is not there. Bob Whitehead knows that, when costed on a through-life basis, his products are much cheaper and create jobs in Australia for Australians. Each unit has an Australian material content in excess of 82 per cent and involves 3,000 to 5,000 man-hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year RFW lost out to Volvo in a contract for trucks in the Hunter Valley coal mines. These are big trucks; per unit, construction costs in the vicinity of $350,000. That did not stop Volvo slicing the cost to $165,000 per unit and naturally cornering the market. Last year Volvo lost millions of dollars in its Australian operations; this style of market penetration must be a factor. The Australian companies simply cannot afford to buy business like this: technically it is not called dumping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that a mine, Nova Coal, in the Hunter Valley has had 10 hours of work out of its Volvo in five months. If the down time cost were capitalised it would make the Australian vehicle appreciably better value. When the overseas manufactured vehicle is operational it will not last because it is built for highways such as we have never seen and not for Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stewart and Stevens airport tugs imported from the United States of America by Qantas are another example. RFW has recently had to rebuild the axles on two of them, as wheels fell completely off. Mercedes-ZF axles and transmissions of German origin are being used. One had a universal fail and it was a non-replaceable item, worth $3,600 from Germany. RFW manufactured new axles with replaceable universals for $3,500 each. </PARA>

In the first month the vehicle broke its chassis. Since Kenworth would not honour any warranty and BHP would not pay for the repair, the Australian body builder had to cop the loss. From my own involvement in the Industry, Science and Technology Committee's inquiry into shipbuilding, this studied lack of interest in Australian manufacture is typified in BHP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, not all Australian companies are as narrow in their attitudes. ALCOA has always had difficulties with its ingot carriers at its Victorian refinery. The problem is that it uses German machines with hydraulic wheel motors and hydraulic motors do not like heat: the oil boils and they cease to operate. There was no mechanical drive available in the world able to stand up to the constant direction changing. ALCOA asked RFW to look at it and will shortly take delivery of Australian invented and built, mechanically driven equipment. I applaud ALCOA and wish that more Australian firms would follow its lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A drilling company in Australia that specialises in long rigs for deep reverse circulation drilling and other complicated and technically difficult wells is Walsh Drilling Brothers. It built its own equipment because it is seeking performance that is not commercially available. It purchased a secondhand six-by-six RFW as a support vehicle and was so impressed with it that when the company needed a carrier for its new large plant it had an eight-by-eight specially built by RFW. I understand the company has been very happy with the choice and I have had the opportunity to see correspondence between it and RFW with regard to its appreciation of the vehicle's performance. It drives like a car and it is earning its keep working in the sandhills around Oodnadatta where it often has to tow other vehicles as well as itself. There have been many offers to buy the rig for cash from envious Americans, but the Walshes say they are too busy to build another one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We probably still have the best metalwork skills in the world, but unless we re-establish our manufacturing industry, our tool makers, die makers, instrument fitters, machinery and lathe skills, the skills will die out. What we need is a buy Australian ethos and a direction from government that its purchases, both civil and military, must be based on the concept of real through-life cost. Once this commonsense decision is taken, we will quickly see a real growth in manufacturing industry and a basis from which we can export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, there has to be a greater focus by the Government in its purchasing policies on actually looking at the overall cost of the downtime, the replacement cost and the delays occasioned to Australian industry by the need to obtain these parts from overseas.

This company is typical of many others, particularly in the manufacturing sector, that have gone to the wall, that have been sacrificed for the short term solution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a person travels through life, he meets up with many people and he is impressed by the work and the activities of certain people. Today, I would like to pay a tribute to the late Robert John Alison, CMG, of Dungog. The town of Dungog and the district are situated within my electorate of Lyne. Over the years I have known Mr Alison particularly well. He was born in 1910 and went to Dungog Primary School, East Maitland Boys High School and the Trinity School at Strathfield in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After completing his education, he went on the farm as a grazier and a dairy farmer of Dungog. He later became a very great sportsman indeed, and he represented Australia at polo. He was also a prominent rugby union player. In his early days, he joined the Hunter River Lancers because he was interested in the defence of Australia and he was interested in horsemanship. He played a major role in the Lancers in those days, and I believe that they still exist today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1941, he joined the services and became a major in the 2/16 Infantry Battalion. He served in New Guinea at Shaggy Ridge and Markham Valley. After that, he was transferred to the 7th Division, serving in Borneo for quite a period of time in a major role. It was there that he met his wife, Mary Chandler, a member of the Medical Women's Army Service. After the war they returned to Dungog to follow agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is very prominently known as a man who served the community of Dungog, let alone the State and the Commonwealth. After returning from service, he was a founder of the Dungog RSL sub-branch. He always organised the Anzac Day commemorative services. He was a foundation member of Legacy and the President of Legacy. I believe he is the only patron of the Hunter Valley group of the Legacy organisation. At the time of his death late this year, Mr Alison was president of the Dungog Historical Society. I recently attended a function of the society to pay tribute to him. His widow and family were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose Mr Alison can be best remembered for his service to agriculture. He was a man who loved stock, he loved the land, he loved the breeding of stock, he loved the production of the product, both of the beast and the soil, and he was interested in the manufacturing and the marketing of the dairy and beef industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a chairman of the Dungog Agricultural Society and his son, Dougal, was the chairman to follow him. He was always the chief dairy cattle steward at the Dungog Show. He was a keen follower of the Royal Agricultural Society and he was a steward of the beef section there for a 20-year period, which is a very outstanding period indeed. In 1946, he followed his father, who was a pioneer of the Dungog district, as Director of the Dungog Cooperative Dairy Society. In 1959, he was elected the chairman of the board, a situation that he occupied until 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also a member of the Dairy Farmers Cooperative Ltd of New South Wales, which was a very large commercial group, representing and dealing with the products of most of the dairy farmers of New South Wales. He was elected a member of the board in 1946. In 1953 he was elected the deputy chairman and from 1962 to 1980 he was chairman of the company and the nine subsidiary companies associated with the Dairy Farmers Cooperative. This was a great responsibility because the cooperative was primarily responsible for the distribution of the liquid milk trade in Sydney and most of the State of New South Wales. He was also a member of the State and the Federal cooperative insurance boards and he occupied a position of chairman of each of those for quite a period of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall, as a member of the New South Wales Parliament back in the late 1960s, the problems of the dairy industry. The Minister of the time appointed an advisory board to look at the problems of the marketing of liquid milk and of the sale of the manufactured product. Mr Alison was appointed as a member of the council to investigate the industry. They certainly gave an excellent report in relation to the condition of the industry at that stage and also to the future of the dairy industry in New South Wales. In about 1977 he was recognised by the Queen for the services that he gave, for his contribution to the community and to primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides being survived by his wife, Mary, he is also survived by five boys; there were no daughters in the family. Robert, his son, is the Usher of the Black Rod in the Senate chamber. His son, James, occupied the position of chairman of the Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society after the retirement of the father. In fact, Mr Alison left in his family the legacy of a group of people who were very interested in the welfare of the community of Dungog and the district generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay a tribute to Mrs Alison and the five sons for the way that they supported the husband and father over such a very long period of time. The late John Alison was not only a man who served Australia in time of need but also a person who served the community of Dungog. He loved the town of Dungog. He loved the community, as he loved his soil and his stock. If you went to Dungog today, which is a small country town, and spoke to citizens in the main street or anywhere, they would all have a good word to say about the late John Alison. He was a modest man; he was a personal man; he was a man who set a fine example to the citizens around him. He encouraged people to actually produce from the soil or from manufacture or from anywhere else. He was that type of a man. I knew him well because he was involved with the old Country Party for over a 50-year period. Naturally, I respect him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew John Alison because of the advice that he gave to me on a number of occasions&mdash;sensible, practical advice that provided solutions to problems that we saw around the community that were difficult to find an answer to. John Alison was a person who could sum up the problems in a very few words; he could give you the answer and encourage you to go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that I shared with him a similarity so far as our past inheritance was concerned because he was fair of skin and I was fair of skin. I had to leave the farm because of the sun cancers on my skin. He always used to say to me, `Bruce, make sure that you wear a hat.' We always had a talk about a hat and he always asked me where my hat was. I fondly remember him because of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We pay a tribute in this chamber not only to those who have served here and who have now departed the scene but also to many others that we recognise within the community. There would not be a better person that we could pay a tribute to than the late Robert John Alison of Dungog. </PARA>

I was a student at Monash University at the time and I remember attending some marvellous performances by Gough at the Springvale Town Hall and Festival Hall in Melbourne. I had joined the Party a little earlier that year, so it is 20 years now that I have been active in the Labor Party. I also recall that on 29 August of that year I turned 20, my birth date was drawn out of a hat and I became eligible to do national service and to be sent to Vietnam. I did not vote Labor simply because one of Gough Whitlam's first acts was to be to stop national service for Vietnam, but I was most grateful that Labor was elected to power in December 1972 and that I could avoid the terrible trauma that other young Australians went through.</PARA></TALK.START>

I might say that more Bills were introduced and passed by the House of Representatives by Gough Whitlam's Government than by any other government in a similar period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of lessons that I take out of the Whitlam period. One is about the pace and the cost of reform. Reform needs to be introduced at a pace whereby people understand it, and one brings along the people. But that does not mean that one shirks that reform, and we certainly have not. It also means that one has to pay for those reforms. We are the only government since Federation to run surpluses of the Commonwealth Budget. We understand the need to spend at times on reform and at other times to save money. We should remember, of course, that Whitlam brought the Federal government into the mainstream of Australian life. It had been asleep for 23 years, it had not been used as a decent instrument of government, and what Gough did for us was to teach us the lesson of the importance of this chamber, this place, and the powers of the Commonwealth Government to make it a better nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second lesson which I take is the whole concept of the social wage, which Gough told us about. Wealth is not just the income which people derive from work but the things that governments can deliver like Medicare and decent schools and hospitals. The problem that Gough ran into, and he reminded us of it again last night on the program, was that the trade union movement had not learnt the lesson, along with the political arm of the Australian labour movement. They were still pushing for higher wages. The Whitlam Government was unable to stop that wage push and convince people at that time that there were decent substitutions or additions to people's income via Medicare and increased spending on education and hospitals and so on. But that is a lesson that we have learnt. We introduced an accord between the trade union movement and this Government way back in 1982, such that we could marry two things together. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element is that Gough first taught us the lesson about the importance of the rest of the world. Australia had been very narrow minded in the way that it approached the rest of the world; we had mainly been hiding behind the coat-tails of the United Kingdom. I guess it was Gough's diplomatic efforts which took us into the international arena which we now, in the last 10 years, have improved upon by taking us into the economic arena internationally. But I think we have really carried on a tradition that Gough Whitlam commenced. He opened us up really through the foreign affairs, through his ability as a diplomat and a national leader, and we followed on and improved that because we in the Labor Party have also learnt the very important lesson that we need to produce wealth as well as to learn how to distribute it. </PARA>

The interesting thing with the accession to power of Jeffrey Kennett is that it will now be much easier to draft players into Western Australia and South Australia to escape Jeffrey Kennett. The West Coast Eagles now are the dominant power of AFL football.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legal decision on the Wills by-election has exposed an unfair and archaic absurdity regarding the question of office of profit and when the person is `chosen' to enter parliament. This should be resolved by referendum at the next election and I believe it would attract bipartisan support. The High Court judgment, however, has exposed a more far-reaching constitutional problem. It seems that Australian citizenship is not by itself sufficient qualification to stand for parliament. This creates two classes of citizenship in Australia. It affects the rights of millions of Australians born overseas and many of their children born in Australia. It has major overtones for policy on multiculturalism. It creates a situation where the constitution was written to preclude non-British subjects from holding office but now has underlined that being a British subject means disqualification. In effect, the various citizenship Acts redefining `foreign' may be unconstitutional. The ejection of Robert Wood from parliament may also have been unconstitutional. Race Commissioner Irene Moss has also pointed out the incompatibility of permitting one million British subjects to vote under current laws. What has been exposed is a national legal and cultural identity crisis which can only be resolved by a referendum. This case, together with the Mabo and freedom of speech judgments, has redefined the role of the High Court and raises the question of methods of appointment to that Court.</PARA></TALK.START>

Here is a country with all the natural resources that a nation can have. Our people have the brains, we have the ability, and yet we are not value adding to many of the rural and the mineral resources that we have.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and I am happy to answer the various components of it. The position of the Government's labour market programs is that they fall into four broad groups: training to improve skill levels; wage subsidies to provide incentives to employers; work experience coupled with training; and focus programs to help people with disadvantages. We did a study in  my Department in the middle of 1991 and we discovered that people who had been unemployed for a period of some 12 months or more had a statistical chance of getting themselves into an unsubsidised job, from being in that situation in the work force, of about 3 per cent. If they were able to pick up one of these labour market programs, it improved their chances sevenfold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures have changed since then. The chances now are eight times greater for people who are long term unemployed who find themselves in this situation. If the long term unemployed pick up the Jobstart job subsidy, their chances improve to something like 16 per cent. Of course, it is very important to remember that all of these programs are operated through the CES.

In the Cleary case, the High Court has ruled on the operation of two of the provisions of the Constitution that you outlined concerning the eligibility of persons.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further ordering to which the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) just referred obviously raises a number of matters which in this instance I suspect are of substance as far as this Parliament is concerned. Mr Speaker, I put this question to you as the custodian of this place and as the person referred to in the Constitution: what is the position regarding salary, allowances, including travelling allowance, and other perquisites of office that were paid to Mr Cleary during that period he believed he was the elected honourable member for Wills; what is the status of those who have been employed in turn by him as staff; and what is the position regarding section 46 of the Constitution? As you will well recall, Mr Speaker, section 46 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any person declared by this Constitution to be incapable of sitting as a senator or as a member of the House of Representatives shall, for every day on which he so sits, be liable to pay the sum of one hundred pounds to any person who sues for it in any court of competent jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>These matters need to be answered in this place as we are shortly to rise for the summer adjournment and it is possible that we shall not return. There are a number of matters which have arisen and which have not, I would suggest, been adequately responded to with respect to dicta concerning the candidates for the by-election other than Mr Cleary. As a result of the interpretation placed on section 44(i.) there is obviously considerable uncertainty about this place as to the extent to which a number of members may or may not be subject to that provision. That subsection, of course, relates to a person who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, could you before the next day of sitting consider the matters that have been raised by the shadow  Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), and the honourable member for Kooyong, and the matters I have raised subsequently so that before the House adjourns for the summer break we can all be aware of the implications of what I think is one of the most serious constitutional issues that could possibly arise with respect to the status and continued incumbency of a number of members of this place?</PARA>

With relation to Mr Cleary's salary, which is paid for by the Department of the House of Representatives, we are seeking advice on that matter. We hope to have that advice today or tomorrow. With relation to the payment of staff salaries, that is a matter for the Minister for Administrative Services, not me. With relation to other arrangements which members and senators have, such as travel, office and accommodation expenses, that is a matter for the Minister for Administrative Services, not me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With relation to a person being able to lodge a claim of one hundred pounds a day against a member who is sitting here in contravention of the Constitution, that was changed somewhat in 1975 when the Common Informers (Parliamentary Disqualifications) Act, which is Act No. 28 of 1975, was passed. That limits the amount that can be claimed against such a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the question about nationality and the eligibility of members to sit in this place, that is a matter that the Court has not given a judgment on but on which it has given what one might say was a guide, as lawyers have said to me, on the way the Court may decide if a matter were brought before it. The House itself may be able to refer members but that, as I said in my answer twice to the honourable member for Higgins, is not a matter that I, as the Speaker, have anything to do with. It could be a matter for the House, but it is not a matter for me personally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I raise a matter that becomes associated with the situation that has occurred. I am wondering whether you are able to advise the House. The circumstances of Mr Cleary draw my attention to circumstances I was involved in in local government when, after a particular election, a candidate&mdash;I think one of four&mdash;who received a very small proportion of the vote, and certainly not enough votes to influence the outcome, was found to be ineligible to contest the election. Another candidate went before the Court of Disputed Returns and the election was declared invalid. That occurred at local government level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always raised with me the concern as to whether, were a Mr Cleary or some other ineligible person to be in an election for the Federal Parliament, this situation could arise. I have not been able to discover the answer, but I ask you, Mr Speaker, whether it is possible for you to advise the Parliament, through the Attorney-General or whatever, on that situation. It raises what is another very interesting situation with people taking the opportunity, in the case of a certain member, to ensure that they are not elected simply by running an ineligible candidate. Presumably we could go on having by-election after by-election. I think the matter is of some seriousness by the mere fact that somebody has been found ineligible to stand in this place. Had that position been established and Mr Cleary not won, would the circumstances that confronted me on that occasion be effective at this particular level?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax and the enhancements to the PRRT introduced in the August 1990 Budget were integral components of what has become a decade of micro-economic reform undertaken by the Government in the petroleum industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On taking office in 1983, Labor found a petroleum industry subject to heavy government control, and where uncertainty was undermining an industry already possessing a high degree of natural risk. Moreover, in 1983 the outlook for Australia's continuing to supply a high proportion of its oil needs from its own production ranged from uncertain to poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s the then Bureau of Mineral Resources indicated that the domestic production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring LPG from existing and planned new developments would increase to 1985, but then decline. In the absence of substantial new discoveries, the reports indicated that Australia's level of self-sufficiency would fall to somewhere about 30 per cent by the mid-1990s. These reports emphasised that new discoveries and developments would be essential in the forecast period if Australia's level of self-sufficiency was to be maintained at the level then prevailing, some 66 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government addressed this challenge through a comprehensive program of fundamental reforms designed to encourage a vigorous, dynamic and competitive petroleum industry. The Government's program of reform to date has included deregulation of the oil and liquefied petroleum gas markets, implementation of an offshore exploration strategy to facilitate the development of Australia's petroleum resources, fundamental change to secondary taxation regimes, and the development of a national gas strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the Government's policy reform agenda, the gloomy picture foreseen by earlier forecasters has not emerged. The policy environment in which the industry operates has been changed beyond recognition; the industry has, simply put, been revitalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real oil prices today are lower than they were following the first oil shock in 1974. Despite this, Australia has fared well in terms of investment in exploration and development in our offshore waters. Self-sufficiency currently stands at around 85 per cent. Furthermore, we can be optimistic about future prospects. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in its latest forecasts, noted that there was an excellent chance that oil production could be maintained at current levels or even increased, up to and beyond the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has overhauled the industry, and the results are there to be seen. The PRRT is an integral part of that reform program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The requirement to report on the operation of the PRRT Act arose out of the legislation that implemented the 1990 Budget reforms to the PRRT. These reforms extended the PRRT to Bass Strait. They also introduced company-wide deductibility for exploration expenditure in all PRRT areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PRRT is an efficient tax. Unlike other secondary taxes, it is levied only on the net income of a profitable project. It does not adversely affect production in times of changing prices and costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the PRRT provides a reasonable balance between providing the private sector with adequate returns for the risks it takes in investing in petroleum exploration and development, and providing the community with a fair return on the use of its non-renewable resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision in 1990 to extend the PRRT to the Bass Strait project was the outcome of an intensive review brought forward by the Government in the light of industry concerns evident at the time. The excise and royalty regime, which the PRRT replaced, had become too inflexible to adapt to changing market conditions. Frequent variations had become necessary, with the result that the regime was complicated and distorted investment and production decisions. The Bass Strait producers argued that they could invest a further $1 billion to $1.5 billion to extract an additional 200 to 300 million barrels of oil if the petroleum taxation arrangements were reformed. The impact of the tax changes is clear&mdash;the Bass Strait project has been rejuvenated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New developments currently under consideration include the construction of two new platforms at a combined cost of $650m to extract a further 85 million barrels of oil. Two other fields, containing a combined total of 16 million barrels, are also expected to become viable under the PRRT. Major infill drilling and workover programs on existing platforms are currently estimated to add 150 million barrels of economically recoverable oil. Exploration activity has also surged, with big increases in both seismic surveying and exploration wells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the fundamental impediments to further development identified by the Bass Strait producers have been removed. Furthermore, it is clear that the move to PRRT has avoided the situation where some production was stopped at low oil prices, because of the distorting tax regime then obtaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider impact of the PRRT reforms also needs to be considered. Australia's offshore areas are only lightly explored. To ensure that the full potential of our resources is realised, we must create an environment that facilitates efficient exploration. The introduction in 1990 of company-wide deductibility for exploration expenditures against the PRRT removed a significant impediment to efficient offshore petroleum exploration. The reforms mean that new exploration decisions are driven by prospectivity and technical factors rather than by distortions in the taxation arrangements. While it is too soon to fully assess the impact of this amendment to the PRRT, the signs are all positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association has reported that wider deductibility appears to be diversifying exploration activity among its members. Increased holdings of offshore acreage by local and international companies indicate that funds that may once have gone to areas abroad have been redirected to Australia and activity in offshore frontier areas has remained very encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some industry submissions to the report raised concerns about the effect of the 1990 reforms on natural gas developments. I should say that copies of those papers are available from my office. One concern was the reduction in the premium on the carry forward rate for general project expenditure from 15 to 5 percentage points above the Commonwealth long term bond rate. It was argued that the reduced premium would impede the development of commercial gas projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the premium reflected the significant benefits to industry that derived from the introduction of company-wide deductibility for exploration, and the relative risks of the different stages of a petroleum project. The carry forward rates and the tax rate for the PRRT are part of a balanced and integrated package that includes wider deductibility for exploration expenditures. To preserve the community return, any adjustment in the carry forward rate for general expenditure would require a corresponding adjustment elsewhere. The issue raised has been carefully examined, and there is no evidence that the current provisions are impacting adversely on developments. Therefore, changes will not be made to the carry forward provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the concerns raised in connection with the impact of the PRRT on gas prices. Some submissions argued that the PRRT will directly impact on Victorian gas and ethane users with a consequential adverse impact on industry and employment. Requests for change were made in submissions by both the producers and their gas and ethane customers. The Bass Strait producers asked that gas and ethane revenues from the Bass Strait project be singled out for a specially reduced rate of taxation. The Government is not prepared to accept this suggestion. The PRRT is a project tax, not a product tax. A change of this kind would reintroduce the type of taxation distortions on investment that characterised the former excise and royalty regime. The producers' request also ignores the windfall reduction in secondary tax that they received in the early years of the PRRT. It would undermine the legitimate community return from the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Users of natural gas and ethane asked the Government to regulate in some way the price of gas products from Bass Strait to ensure that the producers were not including a PRRT component. In this regard, it is worth highlighting that a number of factors intervene to determine gas prices to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I want to reiterate that the PRRT is a project tax, not a product tax, and again note the windfall gain in reduced secondary taxation in the early years of the PRRT received by the Bass Strait producers. Second, prices for gas and ethane are negotiated by the parties involved consistent with normal commercial practice. Whether PRRT falls under the definition of costs that can be passed on is currently being decided by legal interpretation of the existing contracts and by arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with normal commercial practice, the Government would expect that once the legal standing of the contracts has been decided negotiations will commence in regard to what amount, if any, of the PRRT will be passed on. These matters are best determined by the parties concerned and are currently being resolved by contractual arbitration and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further factor relevant to natural gas prices in Victoria is the Victorian Government's public authority contribution charge on the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria. In the 1990-91 financial year the contribution amounted to $242m. In 1991-92 it was $265m. The Victorian Government has the option of varying this charge, which is three to four times the figures being discussed in relation to the PRRT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can observe that, in the absence of these charges, Victoria would have by far the cheapest gas in Australia, with an indicative city gate price for 1990-91 at Melbourne of 87c per gigajoule, compared with $2.40 per gigajoule in Adelaide and $2.85 in Sydney, based on figures from the Australian Gas Association. One can also observe that the Kennett Government has shown no compunction in raising Victoria's domestic gas prices by some 10 per cent since assuming office some weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these factors, the argument that the application of PRRT will be disruptive to end users of natural gas and ethane cannot, in the Government's view, be sustained. It is clear that there is no direct link between the PRRT and the price of natural gas and ethane to the consumer. Nevertheless, the Government recognised that there were special circumstances affecting the prices for natural gas in Victoria. When the Government implemented the 1990 reforms to the PRRT it sought to minimise any potential transitional impacts on the Victorian natural gas market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth therefore provided the Victorian Government with a special grant of $60m for the first two years of the application of the PRRT in Bass Strait. Following the grant, the then Victorian Government stated in the Victorian Parliament in May 1991 that it would become its responsibility to ensure that the application of the PRRT was not passed on. I am not aware of any change in this position following the change of government in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the PRRT provides the certainty and stability needed to attract long term investment in our petroleum exploration and production industry. The Government indicated at the time of the 1990 reforms that it would not be considering any further concessional changes to the arrangements for petroleum production taxation. Nevertheless, in preparing this report I have given careful consideration to industry arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can advise that the Government will further examine the restrictions on the transferability of expenditures on disposal of a partial interest in a project. We will consider issues such as whether a transfer of expenditures should be proportional to the interest in the project, whether each project category of expenditure should be transferred proportionally or whether it should be optional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also examine further the legislative provisions affecting the end of year transfer of exploration expenditures under farm-in arrangements that are commenced part way through the financial year. In this context, we need to ensure that the policy objectives of company-wide deductibility are in fact being met, while ensuring that the PRRT does not inhibit risk sharing and management that are normal aspects of oil industry activity. I expect that an announcement on these matters will be made in the first quarter of 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government gave an undertaking to the Senate in June 1991 to include in this report details of the time taken to administer applications for project production licences. Since 1985, the Commonwealth has received 14 applications for a production licence of which 13 have been awarded. In considering applications the Government needs to examine a number of resource management issues. Details of the processing of applications are included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Australia has a regulatory and taxation regime for petroleum exploration and development that makes us internationally competitive. This has been recognised internationally by respected, authoritative sources. The report I table today shows that the Government's package of reforms for the industry is working. New investments are going ahead in Bass Strait under the PRRT. The report also indicates that exploration activities in our offshore areas are no longer being affected by taxation that distinguishes between project and frontier areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government assumed office in 1983, it found a hopelessly over-regulated petroleum industry, contemplating a declining role in meeting Australia's vital crude oil needs. The Government set about systematically freeing up the energies of the industry, with bold reform policies. Petroleum resource rent tax is a key element of those reforms, providing a strong stimulus to the industry, while safeguarding the community's return for the use of its non-renewable resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PRRT is an excellent example of micro-economic reform introduced by this Government in the area of energy, and indeed the economy as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report deals with the complex subject of the operation of the petroleum resource rent tax. It is a report which was mandated by the Parliament and which has forced the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to come back and present the same to the Parliament on this occasion. Perhaps the two most critical aspects arising from the report&mdash;quite apart from an error in it&mdash;are that, firstly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insufficient time has elapsed to be completely definitive about the impact of the PRRT on the petroleum exploration and production industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the impact of the company-wide deductibility provisions for exploration expenditures under the PRRT.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is a report giving a holding judgment&mdash;an interim or transitional judgment&mdash;in respect of the operation of the PRRT. I do not necessarily criticise that, because it has come about, in part, because of the time factors and constraints and the relatively short period of overall time which has elapsed since the commencement of the operation of the PRRT, especially in respect of the Bass Strait project. The second and more sweeping statement is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of submissions argued that the PRRT will directly impact on prices for Victorian natural gas and ethane. The arguments are not sustainable. There is no direct correlation between the community return derived by levying the PRRT on net revenues from the Bass Strait project and the prices for natural gas and ethane to consumers in Victoria. A number of agents and factors occur in the production and marketing chain to determine prices.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very sweeping statement which will be subject to detailed examination. It prompted the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) to give me a note which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent of the PRRT legislation was to shift tax from excise base to profit base. There was no intent to create a new consumption tax. Esso is currently taxing Chemplex for ethane as a feed stock to make polythene foam, and a bill in respect of this has now been affirmed at around $15m, but that is a matter of disputation, litigation and arbitration at this time. The Gas and Fuel Corporation expects to have price increases demanded by producers and will pass on those price increases to consumers, whether they be industrial or private.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for La Trobe has studied this issue in considerable detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some general comments on the operation of the PRRT since its introduction to the Bass Strait&mdash;the main dimension associated with this report. It was always obvious that the PRRT would have a particular impact on Victoria, but not exclusively Victoria. It created a degree of uncertainty at a very difficult time for the Victorian economy. This report does not really offer much definitively in terms of clearing up that measure of uncertainty; which is the subject of some continuing negotiation, liaison, conciliation, arbitration and, ultimately, litigation, particularly with regard to the standing and legality of a number of contractual obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long way to go before this matter will be resolved. The Minister's statement&mdash;in a sense, conjuring up the belief that all is okay with regard to this matter&mdash;is not really stating the truth, because all is not yet okay. On page 8 of the Minister's statement on the report, he indicated that this matter is not yet resolved. There are different tax and royalty rates for oil and gas projects across Australia and Australian waters. Of course, these differences lend to distortions of the market and they cause economically inefficient decision making. That is very much the case and it will always flow from a situation where there is compartmentalisation in respect of tax regimes on gas. However, I accept that there is a need for that compartmentalisation in special circumstances&mdash;for example, in relation to the North West Shelf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Federal Government gave $60m to the then Victorian State Government&mdash;the Cain and Kirner governments&mdash;as a one-off adjustment to ease the burden of the transition flowing from the application of the PRRT to the Bass Strait. It is not clear where that $60m ended up. I assume that it went to the Victorian State Treasury and that it has, in fact, been paid. The Minister has confirmed that, and I thank him. So great is the morass of Victorian public finances that there is no real certainty at the end of the day that the $60m, in practical terms, went to the problem earmarked and allocated for by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to examine this aspect very carefully. I want to provide a degree of certainty on this matter from the Opposition side by stating that there should be no expectation that a coalition government would add to that $60m payment. As the Minister has indicated, that was a one-off payment in circumstances which were detailed at the time by the then Treasurer when introducing the PRRT Bass Strait dimensions some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to highlight further a couple of other aspects of the report. Chapter 3 on page 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notion that the PRRT will adversely impact on the competitiveness of Bass Strait gas is rejected. No evidence is available that the difference between attributable PRRT and State royalty for onshore projects is likely to be a major consideration in the cost of natural gas to consumers. Other factors including market value are far more important in the final price of gas.</PARA>
<PARA>I highlight that statement because I know it will be of considerable interest to many organisations and many commercial operators in the State of Victoria as they go about their planning. This is the comment flowing from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in its report tabled by the Minister this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to page 9 of the report. Under a section headed `Comment', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prices for natural gas and ethane are determined under negotiated contractual arrangements. Currently the only PRRT-liable revenues from natural gas and ethane are derived from the Bass Strait project and the two products are sold exclusively to Victorian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is not correct. What the Department has overlooked, what the Minister has overlooked and what the Government has overlooked is that the Gas and Fuel Corporation is a supplier for this provincial City of Albury. It is their bad luck that Albury happens to be in my electorate of Farrer which is within the State of New South Wales. In fact, it goes further. It goes beyond Albury and the municipality of Albury: it goes to the brickworks at Jindera, which is beyond sight of the Murray River and beyond sight of the State border between New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has all these public servants sitting down there in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy applying themselves to producing a very important report. I accept that it is a very important report and that he is an active Minister. He recently led a delegation to Taiwan&mdash;he was following in the footsteps of myself, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others&mdash;and showed a degree of activity for which he is noted, including bungy jumping. Quite seriously, I make the point that, as Minister, he would require of his Department that these things were set right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another ramification to this. Elsewhere in the statement the Minister alluded to the PAC dividend and the fact that the Kennett Government has raised domestic gas prices by some 10 per cent in that particular mini-Budget, which I acknowledge. But it does not stop at the border either; that 10 per cent increase flows into Albury, into the Jindera brickworks, which is north of Albury, and further into the State of New South Wales and to other consumers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am complaining about accuracy. There is a very clear-cut statement that the gas is sold exclusively to Victorian consumers. That is not the case. It does in fact flow across the border. As we develop the Australian gas industry, it is logical that it is going to flow across a lot more borders variously around Australia. We need to be very conscious of that aspect as we deal with this report before the House. The coalition will give further careful consideration to the implications of the report on the operation of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject one aspect of the Minister's comments that we are now internationally competitive so far as oil, gas resources and energy generally relate to their prospects in competing on the international stage. I am afraid to say that that is not fully true because there are other taxes which impact on oil research, oil exploration, oilfield development and oilfield production as well on gas exploration and gas production. I refer to taxes such as payroll tax, direct and indirect elements of sales tax, as well as fuel excise tax itself, which is not a small amount in terms of the operation in remote areas and in Bass Strait on the costs of these companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the House in very clear-cut terms that we will add to the international competitiveness of the energy and resources sector by our clear-cut commitment in the coalition's Fightback package to abolish all payroll tax, to abolish all sales tax, to abolish all fuel excise tax and to lower income tax in relation to the key elements of the Fightback package. The Minister even has that wrong because the Leader of the Opposition has made a very clear-cut statement that there will be no road user charges until 1 July 1996. </PARA>

No matter how many times Government members try to distract attention by running one diversion after another&mdash;I do not care whether it is the flag, the monarchy or any other diversion the Prime Minister chooses to run&mdash;and no matter how many times they abuse Question Time in this House, because they use it as a cowards' castle where the Prime Minister gets up, drops his bucket and leaves but is never prepared to debate the basic issues of Australia, the people of Australia will never be fooled. </PARA>

We must be the most powerful Opposition in the history of the Western world. We are being blamed for this recession. We are blamed for everything that happens in this country. Of course, at Question Time there is a constant barrage of attack and abuse from the other side. We must, without qualification, be the most powerful Opposition that has ever existed in any Parliament in the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it does not matter what the Government does in this Parliament. It will not make any difference to the outcome of the next election. It does not matter how many clever lines the Prime Minister gets from Dr Watson. It does not matter how many clever lines he uses.

He is responsible for this recession and the people know it. He caused it and the people are seeing day by day that he has no solutions. He cannot fix it. He will be held totally accountable for the pain and misery that he has inflicted on average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just pick up one person whom honourable members on the Government side have quoted incessantly this week in the course of the debates and that is Ross Gittins. They have incessantly quoted Ross Gittins about us. Just to summarise how the image of this Government is emerging and how the people of the electorate are going to see this Government at the next election, even Ross Gittins has put down a description of this Government that is really worth noting, and noting very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He describes it as the `clapped out, idea bereft complacent Government of Paul Keating'. He refers to its having `a blank mind'. His mind is blank. `Dr Hewson has a plan', he says, and then he finally comments on the prospect of Labor being given a fifth term as `appalling'. That is a summary. Even one of the people they quote incessantly can see the extent to which they have let the problems of Australia drift and failed to provide any effective solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the discussion today is to focus on the issue of tax reforms which anybody who looks at the issue of tax reform in Australia knows is fundamentally important to solving our economic and social problems. Any objective observer of our tax system at the present time must draw several simple conclusions. One, it is totally inefficient from the point of view that the tax system ought to be able to efficiently raise a set amount of money to finance the operations of government. It is an inefficient system. It is an inequitable and unfair system and, quite frankly, it compounds many of our basic economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most objective commentators would conclude from that that tax reform is absolutely and fundamentally important to solving our economic and social problems in Australia. It is fundamentally important to developing the sorts of attitudes and the sort of culture we need in Australia to become internationally competitive, to be able to match and to beat the best in the world, and it is fundamentally important, I believe, to building a fair and equitable Australia, which is what we are all very keen to see develop in the course of the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think perhaps most disturbingly, though, when we look at our major economic problems today&mdash;and I think that most people would list those as jobs, the balance of payments and debt, and the lack of savings as the three major problems&mdash;our tax system makes each of those problems worse. It is an anti-job system. It accentuates our balance of payments problems and it discourages savings. As I say, it is unfair and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average taxpayers, the PAYE taxpayers, are disadvantaged under the present system. They are left with money being taken out of their pay packets every week, and yet tax cheats are allowed to run rife in this country. The cash economy is allowed to go on unchecked in this country. It is a basic inherent feature of the existing system that it is fundamentally inequitable and unfair in terms of its impact on PAYE taxpayers. Of course, there are many substantial arguments that others who use our system and use our infrastructure, for example, tourists, do not pay a fair share of their tax when they come to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think if we just focus briefly on the major economic problems, those of jobs, balance of payments, debt and savings, we see how clear-cut it is that this tax system that we have today accentuates or compounds each of those three problems. In fact, the solution to those problems has a fundamental role for tax reform. Fightback overall is an integrated package to deal with those and other problems in Australia. It is more broadly based than just these three economic problems and it goes to the very heart of a whole range of our social problems. But one of the key elements of Fightback is tax reform, principally because it is fundamental to solving those three economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look, for example, at the issue of jobs. The main reason we do not have jobs in Australia is that the business sector in Australia has been subjected to a phenomenal increase in cost, government charges and other inefficiencies in the system which have increasingly made it internationally uncompetitive. We cannot in a large part of our business community compete effectively with comparable businesses in comparable industries in other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental reason for that is the nature of the tax system. If we can develop an alternative tax system which cuts business costs, which abolishes certain key taxes and charges on the business community, which, in the context of a bigger package, lowers a lot of the infrastructure costs and other disadvantages on our business community in Australia, we can boost that business community, we can make it internationally competitive, and it can get on and create wealth and jobs. Quite frankly, the rebuilding of the business community is the only way in which we are going to rebuild or create sustainable and real jobs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the essences of tax reform is to go into the tax system, identify where it is an impediment to the development of business in Australia, and seek to eliminate that impediment or, at the very least, reduce those impediments. That is why our package moves towards a broad-based goods and services tax. It is a fundamental element of becoming internationally competitive as a business community. It is fundamental that the disadvantages our businesses face in terms of the indirect taxes they pay, taxes which are passed through to exports, which make us internationally uncompetitive, have to be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we will not only introduce a broad-based goods and services tax, as something like 70 other countries have done&mdash;we do not want our business to be at a competitive disadvantage&mdash;but also go ahead and abolish other major cost imposts on business, like payroll tax, petrol excise, sales tax, freezing the superannuation guarantee levy, abolishing the training guarantee levy and, of course, seeking, by genuine micro reform, something they do not understand, to eliminate a lot of the cost disadvantages that exist in power and transport, in water, in telecommunications, on the waterfront, and right throughout our basic infrastructure in Australia. It is a package that is designed to lower business costs, and fundamental to that is the GST and the role that tax reform more broadly plays in relation to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is balance of payments and debt. We have a tax system right now which discourages exports and encourages imports. We are running at a huge current account deficit. I think people, quite frankly, are surprised at how big our current account deficit is today relative to GDP, even in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. Most economists figured that we would see a much more significant improvement in our external accounts than has been the case. But we have not. In fact, we have already seen signs in this budgetary year that that situation is getting worse. An essential element in why it is getting worse is because the tax system discourages exports and encourages imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most powerful arguments for a goods and services tax is simply that it takes tax off exports. It encourages exports and it puts tax on imports. It discourages imports. If you want a powerful argument in a debt-ridden country for GST then that is it. It works consistently with the direction we have to go in improving our balance of payments, in boosting exports, in constraining imports, or replacing imports by effective import competition. Of course, it is fundamental to our business community becoming internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that that is the principal reason why most other countries, the 70 I have mentioned, have gone in the direction of a goods and services tax. Under the GATT arrangements, a goods and services or value added tax is the only effective way to subsidise exports&mdash;eliminate the cost disadvantages of those exports, while discouraging imports. Until we do that, we are at a massive disadvantage relative to the businesses in any other country that have a broad based goods and services tax. </PARA>

In relation to the balance of payments and debt, it is pro-improvement in the balance of payments; it is pro-reduction in debt; and, in relation to savings, it is pro-savings. Three powerful reasons that are essential elements of why the broad based goods and services tax, as part of genuine tax reform, is absolutely fundamental to solving our economic problems in Australia. It opens up the key to deal with the other problems; it gives you a fairer system, where the tax cheats actually start to pay, and where tourists actually start to pay a fair share for their use of the infrastructure in Australia; and it provides the wherewithal for the largest personal tax cut in our history&mdash;a 30 per cent personal tax cut! It gives us a Hong Kong style tax system in terms of average tax rates in Australia. A person on an average income of around $25,000 would pay only 14c in the dollar tax; on twice average income he would pay only 22c in the dollar tax. It encourages people to work, it encourages people to save and, with the capital gains tax changes to back it up, it encourages people to go into business and to expand business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want a fight on the GST and tax reform, we will have it. As far as we are concerned, the GST means more jobs for us and it means more jobs for our children; it means a decent education because it opens the door to a better education and a better health system; it means cheaper petrol; it means the abolition of your iniquitous and unfair wholesale sales tax system; it means no payroll tax on jobs, which the Prime Minister himself has said would create 200,000 jobs&mdash;it means, in effect, all up, about two million jobs by the end of this decade, a halving of the unemployment rate, a better balance of payments, a control over our debt levels and, ultimately, significant reductions in debt and an environment in which this country saves and pays its own way in the international community. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

He is persisting with this piece of idiocy that somehow a $40 billion tax shift is going to make a difference to the fundamental problems confronting Australia. He has identified the fundamental problems as being jobs, balance of payments, and I think his third one was the question of savings. He knows that the introduction of the GST would create not one new job, save possibly amongst the accounting profession whose members will have to go through the bewildering administration of trying to operate a GST at the level of each business, and save for the number of additional tax collectors who would have to be employed by the Australian Taxation Office in order to collect this new tax. But in terms of real jobs, jobs which are about adding to the nation's GDP, the GST will not add one job.

Mr Gittins has said, and the Leader of the Opposition knows, that the implementation of Fightback will in fact cost jobs, not increase jobs. Yet we have the Leader of the Opposition coming in here, in the face of that criticism of dishonesty from Mr Gittins, saying that the GST is all about jobs. It is not about jobs, except in the sense that it will be about a diminution of jobs in Australia. Yet what can the Leader of the Opposition say, because little by little his whole approach is beginning to fall to bits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He tries to pretend&mdash;and this is really the heart of the argument, the heart of the deception in this policy&mdash;that this is a policy about taking taxes off business. This is the essential message of what the Opposition is saying. We know that at the time when those opposite are taking taxes off, they are putting them back. Where? Right on business. Who collects the GST? It is business which collects the $20 billion worth of GST, and it is business which will have to collect it and remit it to the Australian Taxation Office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not seem to understand that, far from removing taxes, there are seven new Hewson taxes proposed in the Fightback package. I will go through these seven new taxes. First of all there is the GST, which the Opposition is sometimes prepared to own up to&mdash;only sometimes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second new Hewson tax is the tax on lump sum superannuation payouts taken by people between the ages of 55 and 60. Today, the first $76,000 is tax-free, with a rate of 16.25 per cent applied to the amount above that figure. Fightback proposes a new tax of 20 per cent with no tax-free threshold on those lump sums. The third new Hewson tax is the additional tax on super fund earnings, which will be up from today's rate of 15 per cent to 20 per cent. There will be a new tax of 20 per cent on superannuation fund earnings, compared with the 15 per cent that exists today. Fourthly, there will be new taxes on the contributions to superannuation funds if a person is contributing more than $6,000 a year to super. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the company tax rate will go up from today's rate of 39 per cent to 42 per cent under the Hewson package. Sixthly, tobacco excise will go up by 25 per cent. The seventh new and, to this point, secret tax relates to new road user charges. The Opposition has said it is committed to a user pays principle as far as paying for roads is concerned, which can only mean a road user charge. It cannot work out how to do it, so it has put it off&mdash;at least, it knows what it is going to do; it is just that it will not tell us what it is going to do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It boosts it, for sure. It boosts it in the sense that Australians will be encouraged to take their holidays overseas, which is a negative as far as our balance of payments is concerned. Why? Because the cost of holidaying in Australia will go up. The cost of air fares will go up 15 per cent. The cost of accommodation will go up. The cost of bus fares will go up. The cost of eating out will go up. All of these things which one does on holidays will go up; therefore, people will have an added incentive to take their holidays overseas. On the other hand, it will discourage overseas visitors from coming here, because the cost of holidaying in Australia for an overseas visitor will go up as a result of the imposition of a GST on the tourism industry. We have the Opposition Leader telling us that it is good for exports and bad for imports, when in fact on our leading export industry it has the opposite effect. It is bad for this industry. It encourages Australians to go overseas and it discourages overseas visitors from coming to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point which the Leader of the Opposition made about halfway through his speech was that this is an efficient tax.

A report on that in today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reveals that a GST is a much more expensive tax to collect than PAYE and that it is particularly expensive as far as business compliance costs and, more particularly, small business are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do in Australia is provide encouragement to small business and encourage it to employ people. What a GST does is impose a new tax on small business. It increases the cost of employing labour in small business. Now it does not pay payroll tax, but it will pay a GST, which is a tax on labour. Worse than that, a GST imposes a bewildering compliance cost on small business, which means that it will have to bear the cost of a tax which actually punishes it in terms of its ability to employ people. It will cost small business more to comply than it will big business; therefore, it disadvantages small business as opposed to big business. The GST will not create one job; it will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs from the Australian work force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summarising the Fightback package, I ask this Government: why does it not raise the tax-free threshold; institute a tax-free savings scheme; double the family allowance; abolish payroll tax; increase the dependent spouse rebate; abolish petrol and diesel fuel excise tax, at a saving of $11.40 each time a motorist fills the average fuel tank; institute a uniform goods and services tax, just like the one the Prime Minister advocated in 1985; extend pharmaceutical benefits to non-pensioner retirees; abolish wholesale sales tax&mdash;the 10 per cent, the 15 per cent, the 20 per cent and the 30 per cent sales tax; reduce capital gains tax; reduce fringe benefits tax; and improve the first home owners scheme? That is only a small window of the opportunity and the detail contained in the Fightback package, launched successfully by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) some 12 months ago and successfully sold by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) at meeting after meeting right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it also needs to be expressed in another terminology. There are in fact seven steps associated with the Fightback tax reform package. In the interests of fair and intelligent debate, it is time that these were put down on the record of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step is the total abolition of seven taxes. Out goes all payroll tax, all sales tax, all fuel excise tax, Labor's lump sum superannuation tax, customs duty by the year 2000, and also the 1 1/2 per cent training levy and the coal export duty. Such an impressive proposal is the latter that indeed the Government has picked up on it. The second step is a massive reduction in income tax; an increase in the threshold level from $5,400 to $7,000; and about a one-third reduction in actual income tax paid by the PAYE worker&mdash;along with a reduction in the fringe benefits tax and a review of its impact on regional and remote Australia, a reduction in the rate of capital gains tax and a review of its impact, and particular provisions to assist small business, retirees and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third step is the introduction of a GST at 15 per cent, a much fairer form of taxation. Fifty-nine other countries around the world have already gone down this path. But there will be no GST on health, education, churches, charities, the sale of a property as a going concern and core council rates. It will not increase the CPI by 15 per cent. It does not mean $15 on top of a $100 supermarket bill. It is in fact a 4.4 per cent consumer price index increase, and that has been validated by the Treasurer. Related to that are two other caveats. Let me make it absolutely clear that all GST on all business inputs will be fully refunded. We need to understand that to work out very clearly why it is tilting the tax system back towards the productive sector to generate fair dinkum jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth step is the treatment of excises. I mentioned petrol and diesel fuel excise tax. It will be 26c less for business usage and, when the GST comes back on at about 7c, the individual motorist will still save around 20c a litre&mdash;$11.40 every time we fill the fuel tank. On the question of alcohol excise, there is no change. On the question of tobacco excise, we recognise that there are other considerations which must be taken into account, and there will be an increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth step is very clear-cut and relates to the fact that there is no such thing as an international level playing field. We are prepared to do something about that. Our view on this was validated by Dr Tony Cole when he spoke last week in Brisbane. He thought he was a safe distance from Canberra, from headquarters, and from the failed Treasurer who just addressed this House, but in fact it was on the front page of Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> when he said that the GST reform of tax is the only correct way we can go forward to rinse out the impact of indirect taxes on our exports and make us truly competitive with so many of the other OECD nations and other key nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will in fact zero rate all exports under the GST and remove that sales tax slug from exports, which constitutes a 5 per cent disadvantage on all exporters. That is not my figure; that is a figure from Senator Button's Deputy Secretary&mdash;that all exporters in Australia, against this very unlevel international playing field, are hit with a 5 per cent disadvantage created by the existing sales tax slug. We will abolish all payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax and zero rate all exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth step, of course, relates to compensation. This is not a scorched earth policy; it is a sincere, warm, friendly policy with empathy, particularly for those in need. For aged pensioners there will be an 8 per cent increase in their pension, and a continuing increase from the commencement of a GST. There will be an 8 per cent increase in the service pension, the war widows pension, the civil widows pension and other Commonwealth pensions. There will be a 6 per cent increase in Austudy payments and a range of other benefits. Both the 8 per cent and 6 per cent figures greatly exceed the cost of living increase brought on by the 15 per cent GST. Of course, for retirees there is a special and exciting package, and one which will involve a special payment of $2,500 in certain circumstances. This is a benefit that flows from the increase in the tax threshold level, the $1,000 new savings scheme and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come to the seventh step: how it all adds up. It adds up because it adheres to that clear-cut objective: less government, less taxation, more incentive, more productivity and more jobs. We will deliver that by bringing in the GST, a fair form of taxation, but at the same time abolishing seven other taxes and greatly reducing income tax. It is what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) might describe as a lower tax policy, an LTP. It will give Australians hope; it will give hard-pressed farmers hope; it will give hard-pressed PAYE workers, whether they are in Broken Hill, Braidwood or beyond, some hope. It will give workers right around Australia a fair dinkum return on their efforts, whether they are blue-collar or white-collar workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package adds up. It will raise some $27 billion through the GST and, at the same time, will review some of those programs crying out for review under other government departmental expenditure. It will collect more money from the cash economy and provide a basis for fair dinkum and believable income tax cuts to give real incentive to the Australian community and get this economy back on the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer and this tired old Government have failed this country. The Treasurer's first anniversary as Treasurer is shortly coming up. It is that time of the year when this Government has been shuffling its Treasurers. It is time again that it shuffles its Treasurer for the few short weeks that it remains in office in this country. The sooner the election comes on, so that the people can have the real choice, the better, for the sake of all Australians, both today and in the future. The choice is simple: do people want more of the same under Labor, or fair dinkum and fair change under the coalition?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I follow the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), in this debate. I first of all take the opportunity to congratulate him and his good lady on their recent marriage. But I congratulate him more so on having the good sense to get married before the election on the off chance that he might become the Deputy Prime Minister after the election, when to get married would cost him a good 15 per cent more. He has obviously had a good deal of commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party listed six members on the Government benches who are retiring at the next election and likened them to rats leaving a sinking ship. I point out for his edification that my good friend the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards), the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron) and the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney)&mdash;six members on the Opposition side&mdash;are also retiring at the next election. The Leader of the National Party should think before he leads with his chin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is supposed to be about tax reform. We are told here, and we have been told yet again today, that the GST is tax reform. The GST is not tax reform; it is tax deform. It is a disfigurement of the taxation system, driven by a rigid and uncaring ideology, sold by a rigid and uncaring Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his Deputy, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), one of my prime electoral assets. Driven by ideology, it is a tax deform, not a tax reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we should have the misfortune after the next election to have those opposite occupy the Treasury bench in this House, there will be the largest single redistribution of income in the history of this country, but it will be a redistribution of income from lower and middle income earners and taxpayers to the wealthy. Only today we heard that doctors would get a 60 per cent increase in their incomes under those opposite should they attain government. That is at the very same time when the would-be social security Minister on the other side of this House was caught out labelling the unemployed as riffraff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do those opposite really believe that this is some sort of reform to be proud of? Is it some sort of reform that, accompanying this revamping of the tax structure, this redistribution of tax impost, would slash some $7 billion from the social services and social wage of this country? On this point, those opposite are condemned out of their own mouths. In a press release of 19 August this year, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a portion of the GST goes to finance the Coalition's historic reductions in income tax&mdash;the main portion is financed by expenditure cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that, whether it be in the area of taxation, health, education, social services, sport or the arts, the GST package offered by those opposite will go through the average Australian family quicker than an XPT&mdash;that is, an extra personal tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole framework of this debate by those opposite is essentially, by implication, that this Government has not reformed the taxation system. I think it is amazing that that came from the Leader of the Opposition, given his position as a senior adviser in the previous Liberal Government. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, members of the House and those listening that this Government has lowered the bottom rate of taxation from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. We have lowered the top rate of taxation from 60 to 47 per cent. We have lowered company taxation from 46 to 39 per cent, and we improved the taxation system in this country to make it fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those who occupy the Liberal Party branches on the North Shore of Sydney and in Toorak in Melbourne, who so strenuously and passionately opposed this Government's tax reform efforts in the mid-1980s, particularly on the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, that those things made the taxation system in this country a damned sight fairer than it was in 1983. We found it in disrepair and disarray when we inherited it from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his adviser, the present honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). I remember full well how they marched up and down this country, promising to get rid of the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and the assets test. Where are those things now? They are in the Opposition's own policy document. It has been done for short term political gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are really about creating jobs, we have to have a pro-active approach to taxation policy in this country. I invite those opposite, who are supposedly passionate believers in the efforts of small business, to do that. I invite the Opposition spokesman on small business, housing and customs, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who is sitting at the table, to look at a recent pamphlet which was put out by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) just to see that 58 of the 66 recommendations of the Beddall report on small business have been implemented. So many of those recommendations concentrate on tax reform. I ask the empty vessel who is sitting on the Opposition side of the table to have a good look at that pamphlet. It will be the most concrete look at small business policy that he has had yet. I remind him that in the OECD, by international measure, we are the second or third lowest taxed country, depending on how one wants to argue the issue. That is something that those opposite could never live up to in their day in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind those opposite that their new consumption tax will reduce the value of every dollar which every Australian now has. I remind them of the transitional aspects of their package on the unemployed; the transitional aspects that the Leader of the Opposition has been forced to admit. I remind those opposite, particularly the Opposition spokesman at the table, about the costs of complying with this new consumption tax, which will be far heavier for small businesses than for large businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind those opposite about this proposed new consumption tax that would provide holiday makers with an incentive to have holidays overseas rather than in Australian resorts which would create jobs for Australian kids. It is a tourism policy that the Opposition spokesman on tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), has been belittled and betrayed by. It is no wonder that he fell asleep on his elbow today as the Leader of the Opposition was putting a matter of public importance before the House. Fall asleep he may well do; he is much safer asleep than listening to what the Leader of the Opposition might have to say in his policy area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do those opposite honestly not believe that it does not run the risk of reigniting an inflationary spiral in this country? I also ask them about the confusion in their own ranks. I again refer to the honourable member for Fadden, who said on radio 4QR on 5 April this year that there was no GST on second-hand goods. One of the Opposition's own frontbenchers, on a public radio program, did not even understand a basic aspect of its supposed tax reform. Those opposite wonder why they cannot sell their package to the people of Australia. It is so bereft of any logic that they do not understand it themselves. The honourable member for Fadden, an increasingly slower moving target, fell in it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do those opposite really believe that their new consumption tax will not mean extra costs, paperwork and headaches for Australia's religious and charitable organisations? In Question Time day after day they shed crocodile tears, supposedly trying to paint themselves as being on the same side as these institutions. How does the Leader of the Opposition expect to collect his new consumption tax on the services that are provided for cash to people in their own homes&mdash;such as plumbers unblocking the drains, gardeners, painters, decorators, tilers and people who mow the lawns? The truth is that the complicated system of those opposite will be a fillip to the cash economy, and they know it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) give an insight into the Budget making process under this Government and under the oversight of this incarnation of the artful dodger we have as Treasurer of the country. The Budget process is something to marvel at. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) seems to operate like a mad scientist. He throws every bit of economic nonsense into the test tube, puts a match to the Bunsen burner and waits for the thing to blow up. That is exactly what he does. Then he has the cheek to come in here when he delivers his Budget yelling, `Eureka, I've found it; this is it; this is the answer to all our problems'. Thereafter, he has to go into damage control. That is what these Bills are all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No.4) reflect the blind panic of a government confronted with a national unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent, the worst level of unemployment on record since the Great Depression, and an economic outlook that is, at best, flat over the next 12 months. Within a day of the appalling unemployment statistics being revealed recently, the sad catalogue of events that led up to this situation started to exercise people's minds. Subsequently, the Government produced a mealy-mouthed statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Expenditure program re-allocation</EMPHASIS>, which represents the full extent of Labor's response to the unemployment crisis&mdash;the nearly one million unemployed in this country, and the equal number under-employed&mdash;that it has foisted on the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called expenditure program reallocation sets out to justify reassigning some of the Government's `One Nation, One Job' economic statement spending into the areas that will bring about more rapid job creation. The Treasurer's statement is quite explicit about this. In his press release of 13 November, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government examined all areas of Commonwealth expenditure in order to identify those worthwhile projects and programs that could quickly spend additional funds and deliver rapid job growth. </PARA>
<PARA>The basic thrust of his statement is then to throw money at problems at an even faster rate than provided for in the `One Nation, One Job' economic statement and in the 1992 Budget of only a few months ago. The Treasurer's statement of 13 November, and these Bills, which give effect to that statement, represent the entirely predictable failure of the `One Nation, One Job' economic strategy put forward by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I use the word `strategy' jokingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement was always going to be a failure because it failed to provide for greater business investment and thus for economic growth and the creation of real jobs. Instead, it sought to artificially stimulate employment ahead of the next election, of course, with absolutely no regard for the consequences that would flow for the economy once the election had passed and the unfunded spending of the `One Nation, One Job' statement comes back to plague the Commonwealth Budget. It now turns out that the `One Nation, One Job' statement has failed to deliver even on the miserable goal of artificially stimulating employment prior to the next election. The `One Nation, One Job' statement has failed to provide the jobs Labor promised at the time of its delivery of that statement, so Labor will now rip funds off many of its One Nation spending promises and reallocate them to areas that will serve to fast track artificial job growth ahead of the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will take $150m from its promised One Nation rail expenditure and another $24m off its electricity grid expenditure for this very purpose. These reductions will be offset by increases in spending on labour market programs and a variety of community, sport and heritage pork-barrelling, giving the impression that the Government somehow believes in a community, sport and heritage led recovery rather than one driven by business investment and economic growth. In addition, the Government will bring forward some of the local capital works spending that was to have been set aside for future years as well as some of the spending on the `black spots' road program. This reallocation of expenditure reveals how totally thoughtless and irresponsible Labor was in its initial allocation of the One Nation spending. The Government simply gave no consideration to the effectiveness of the proposed expenditure then, and it is seeking to rectify that in the most artificial way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's statement says that it would be extremely difficult for the National Rail Corporation to spend prudently by 30 June 1993 the entire $283m allocated in 1992-93 for the national rail system in the One Nation statement. So what is new? Everyone else in the country knew that at the time the `One Job' statement was made in February. Similarly the statement goes on to say that the review `also indicated that funding is not required in 1992 for the upgrading of existing electricity transmission links between the south-eastern States'. What is new? It was apparent to blind Freddy that the Government could not have spent that sort of money in the time span proposed. In other words, Labor was promising to throw money around willy-nilly in its February statement and in the 1992 Budget with no regard to whether these funds were actually required or could be usefully spent in the timeframe that was originally proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's desire to spend its way out of trouble has, amazingly, in the eyes of the Treasurer, if we can believe him, exceeded the capacity of the nation's run-down national infrastructure to absorb that very spending&mdash;at least in the case of the railways and the national electricity grid. The Government's incompetence is of such a magnitude that it cannot even create short term artificial jobs with additional government spending, much less real jobs, that might flow from a genuine and comprehensive attempt at economic reform in this country, such as that proposed by the coalition in Fightback. The Labor Party's attempt to increase spending on so-called labour market programs is indicative of how desperate the Government is to save jobs&mdash;the principal one being, of course, the job of the Prime Minister&mdash;ahead of the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer claims in his statement of 13 November, `we expect a total of 20,000 new positions to be created or brought forward as a result of these initiatives'. It is noteworthy that the Government describes these as positions rather than jobs, because that is exactly what they will be. The Government will not be creating real jobs or new jobs that will last beyond the government spending that creates those very jobs; it will be creating positions, and short term positions at that. It is simply creating holding bays for the unemployed until after the next election. It is not interested in, nor is it capable of, creating genuine jobs for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's attempt to subsidise new job creation is simply laughable. Everyone knows that new jobs are not created by the Government subsidising employment in and by private business. While it is possible that subsidised jobs will result in the young unemployed gaining some additional skills, that is the very most we would expect from these programs. What these programs will not provide, and cannot provide, is real and lasting jobs for people to go into and make use of what skills they have. Real and lasting jobs are not created by government subsidies; they never have been and they never will be. Real jobs are created by business investing for growth, and businesses will only start investing again when we have the right investment climate, the right tax policies, the right industrial relations policies, and progress across the board on micro-economic reform and all the other things that need to be done to get this country moving again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Needless to say, the Labor Party has been a monumental failure in providing for all of these things, which is why we have the unemployment crisis facing us today, and which is why we have the nearly one million unemployed and a similar number of under-employed. What these Bills show is that Labor has learned nothing in its nearly 10 years in office. It is going on to repeat the same mistakes it has made since 1983 and which have given this country the worst recession and the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression. An indication of the Government's desperation to create some jobs&mdash;any jobs&mdash;is its 008 telephone number that Labor will establish, which will enable employers to get immediate access to the employment subsidies facilitated by these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucracy will be bending over backwards to help spend this money before the next election, with what could be called the Labor Party's re-election hot line. People can ring up and ask for money and it will be theirs if that will get some people off the unemployment queues and out of the unemployment statistics. That is Labor's version of economic reform for the 1990s&mdash;dial a subsidy and to hell with the long term consequences for the Budget and the economy. Due to massive amounts of unfunded spending, I can assure honourable members that that problem will arise in the future for ensuing Commonwealth governments. It is significant that this ridiculous program will cease on 31 May 1993 which, as honourable members will be aware, is the likely election date, or after it, next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever we needed further evidence that Labor cannot deliver the hopes and aspirations of Australian people, it is encapsulated in these Bills. These Bills are proof that it cannot deliver its One Nation promises and cannot deliver the hopes and aspirations of Australians. These Bills epitomise Labor's addiction to compromise and capitulation. They are evidence of how it goes about substituting compromise and capitulation for sound policy formulation and for energetic, far sighted and innovative government. In all this, of course, the casualties are principles and morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from these totally ineffectual labour market programs, the Government proposes to bring forward the local capital works spending that was provided for in the 1992 Budget. The expenditure is nothing more than blatant pork-barrelling of the worst order. Funds for local capital works are being concentrated in electorates where the Labor Party is in most trouble. Honourable members will be aware that the fact that these areas are often the hardest hit by the recession is not entirely coincidental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of capital works, the Labor Party will also be spending $20m on a variety of community, heritage and sporting facilities. The only rationale provided by the Treasurer for funding these projects is that they will create some artificial jobs quickly in areas where Labor's electoral prospects are bleakest. The notion that this spending will in any way underpin lasting employment growth is simply a bad, sick joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two Bills before us today are designed to give effect to measures announced in the Treasurer's statement of 13 November. It is testimony to Labor's incompetence and desperation that these Bills have been introduced at this time. These two Appropriation Bills are quite unprecedented in that they reappropriate funds from Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2&mdash;the two key Budget Bills. Those Budget Bills had not even been passed by the Senate before the Treasurer made his 13 November statement which will now result in those Bills being altered to reflect the failure of the Government's One Nation and Budget initiatives. </PARA>

Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and 2 are barely three months old, and already the Government has been forced into the recognition that $174m of its proposed spending in 1992-93 cannot now be achieved. These Bills represent the total shambles into which Labor's budgetary strategy has once again fallen. This Government chops and changes Budget Bills within weeks of their being debated in the Parliament, and sometimes when they are still before the Parliament&mdash;always to reflect its politically expedient ends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will resort to any legislative contortion or distortion the law will allow in order to get its latest spending stupidity through this place. It should have been possible to utilise the Advance to the Minister for Finance to accommodate the necessary changes to the Government's spending priorities contained in these Bills, but the Government has not used any of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Obviously the Government wants to keep these funds already allocated in reserve as a contingency fund to buy votes in the lead-up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be more indicative of Labor's economic mismanagement and of its complacency about the need for fundamental economic reform to take place in this country than the two Bills before us this evening. The political expediency of Labor in these matters knows no bounds. It will do anything and it will say anything to get itself re-elected. This includes making up what it passes off as economic strategy as it fumbles along, with every chop and change being rendered by the Labor Party's rhetoric as some new economic policy victory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, the unemployment queues grow longer and Labor becomes more and more brazen in the way it re-invents its so-called economic strategy to suit the needs of the moment. One day the Government will describe an anti-inflation policy as advocated by the coalition as a scorched earth policy; we have heard Government members do that. The next day, when the Government stumbles into a low inflation environment&mdash;courtesy of the recession we had to have&mdash;low inflation becomes the crowning achievement of the Government's record of economic management. Only this Government could come out and describe as a macro-economic policy achievement a totally unintended and totally unplanned reduction in the rate of inflation as the result of the recession. Only this Government and its leaders have the gall to do that. Even the backbench blanch when they are called upon to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the same barefaced lies in relation to the Commonwealth Budget balance. It was not so long ago that the Budget surplus was sacrosanct to Labor, or so it said; it was another supposed achievement of this failed Labor regime. Of course, the surplus has long since been shown to have been an entirely cyclical phenomenon that has been swept away by the emergence of a structural Budget deficit of alarming proportions. Now the Prime Minister says that the Budget balance is essentially irrelevant and dismisses its importance, now that it is no longer politically convenient for him to talk about it and now that it reflects badly on his administration. This is how the Government justifies its almost $50 billion in totally unfunded new spending over the next few years, adding to the public sector debt and interest rates and putting the long term future of the Commonwealth's finances in dire jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But far more outrageous than the Prime Minister's claim that the surplus no longer matters is his statement that the process of micro-economic reform is now complete. Can honourable members believe that! Everyone knows in reality that the process of micro-economic reform in this country has barely started. It is a sick joke to try to kid the Australian people otherwise in the manner of this failed Prime Minister. It is typical of the weak leadership of this man that he would abandon any pretence at giving the nation some form of economic leadership when he thinks there is political mileage to be had by sitting tight and letting the country basically go to rack and ruin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the horrendous levels of unemployment currently facing this country, the Prime Minister and his Labor cohorts should be doubling or even tripling their efforts on the micro-economic reform front. Indeed, they should have done so long ago, starting with their first term in office. Never before has micro-economic reform been more important to this country's future well-being and yet this Prime Minister has the arrogance and the insensitive complacency to claim that the job has already been done. Of course, if the major micro-economic reform tasks had been completed, we would not now be facing this tragic unemployment situation and the economic downturn that Labor has mindlessly inflicted on this country. The Government's complacent rhetoric is betrayed by the staggering magnitude of this country's economic problems. So Labor has failed us in two ways in this context: first, by failing to deliver on micro-economic reform and, second, by failing to recognise the dire consequences of this failure and of providing the necessary leadership to address those consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of this Government was epitomised by the Prime Minister's now infamous performance on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program when he was confronted with the total failure of his policies, and the failure of the One Nation economic statement in particular. For once in his life the Prime Minister was left totally dumbstruck when confronted with the enormity of his economic failures&mdash;and so he should have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `One Nation, One Job' projections on economic growth have been revealed as a sham, and were scaled down in the August Budget, just a few months later, to levels that are now also regarded as optimistic. The only way is down with this Government. The same is true of the Government's projections for unemployment and for the Budget deficit. These have also been blown out of the water by the depth and the protracted nature of the recession this Government knowingly and deliberately inflicted upon the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extravagant commitments made in the One Nation economic statement, promising personal income tax cuts as well as a Budget surplus by 1995-96, are now recognised as wildly optimistic and, most likely, quite unattainable. I would put it even more strongly than that: they are simply unattainable. Even the forecasts made in the 1992 Budget, now barely three months old, are looking decidedly shaky. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget forecasts for unemployment have already been proved to be spectacularly and tragically wrong. The Government has destroyed nine real jobs for every job it has created since handing down the `One Nation, One Job' economic statement, yet it has the barefaced cheek to boast about its so-called expansionary policies for the Australian economy. Whatever the intent of the Government's policies, one thing is clear: they are not expansionary. On the contrary; they are compounding and extending the effects of the recession the Government has knowingly and deliberately forced upon us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is having itself on if it thinks that its fiscal stimulus will do anything other than increase interest rates and crowd out private sector investment, thereby putting the economic recovery in real jeopardy. It is the coalition's Fightback package and its reforms which will stimulate private investment and economic growth by lowering business costs and lowering the overall tax burden on the Australian community. That was more than adequately dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in debate just an hour or so ago in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reductions in Government spending will free up resources for use by the private sector in getting the economy moving once again. The Government continues to believe that it can address fundamental economic problems by throwing around money that it does not have, money that it has borrowed against this country's economic future. This is despite the overwhelming evidence that such an approach is doomed to failure, along with the rest of this Government's economic policies. The Government has tried this approach time and time again, and it has failed time and time again. The results are there for everyone to see. There is not one economic indicator giving us hope and, as I have said already, there are tragic levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November last year there was the employment statement handed down, if anyone remembers, by the former Prime Minister, which sought to have us spend our way out of trouble. It followed the stimulatory 1991 Budget. Then there was the current Prime Minister's One Nation statement, which was followed by the 1992 Budget. Now we have this reallocation of expenditure which somehow is expected to do what its predecessors failed to do&mdash;that is, increase employment and economic growth by throwing money at problems that cannot be solved in that way. Everyone in this country, including the current Prime Minister and those in the Labor Party, knows what needs to be done to get Australia going again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What amazes people around this country is the failure of Labor to get on and do the things that need to be done, and which it has failed to do over nearly 10 years in office. Even more amazing is the fact that the Government has not put forward any policies or any plan for the future of this country after the next election, or even in the run-up to the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where are its policies? We do not see them. They are not in written form. They have not been articulated, either briefly or at length. There is no evidence that this Labor Party has any idea of what it proposes to offer to the Australian people in the lead-up to and after the next election should there be a tragedy and it is re-elected. Nothing is offered to the Australian people. All Labor is offering is more of the same. God help us. God help this country. Labor simply has no idea what it wants to do after the next election, and we can only conclude that, if it is re-elected, it will basically do nothing because that is the sum total of its policies articulated to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly the Labor Party will resort to scare campaigns and the big lie as its platform for the next election since it has no positive policies of its own to speak of. Even in terms of short term political expediency the Labor Party would surely be better off adopting some of the economic reforms proposed by the coalition, instead of sitting on its hands and doing nothing except throw money it does not have at problems it cannot fix. At least the Government would then be holding out some hope for the future, regardless of who won the next election and regardless of whether it can be believed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this Government is too short-sighted, too blinded by its own perceived political interests, to do anything in the long term interest of this country. It hopes that by throwing enough money around it might just squeak past the post at the next election, thereby achieving the full extent of its vision, whatever that might be, for the future of Australia. It must be Labor in power, I suppose, whatever the price. Labor in power whatever the price&mdash;that can be the only objective that is apparent to thinking people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the weekend the Leader of the Opposition signalled his intention to come into this Parliament and debate the real issues confronting this country; not the diversions, not the stunts. The Treasurer is the Minister for stunts, the Evel Knievel of this Parliament, who promises a soft landing and, like Evel Knievel, does not actually manage to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That intention of the Leader of the Opposition was clearly signalled. The Prime Minister was aware of it. But what does he do? He still relies on the fact that half the community, unfortunately, thinks that Question Time is a substitute for debate. We have Ministers saying in their answers, `What this debate is all about'. There is no debate. The coalition parties do not have an opportunity to state an opinion on the views being pressed upon us and the rest of the country at Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when there was a chance given for that debate, provided over the weekend, as I have said, by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;he was not trying to ambush the Prime Minister; it was all out there in the open that he was going to come in and debate the issue&mdash;where was our Prime Minister? Our famous Prime Minister dingoed out. He refuses to debate the real matters of substance in this country today. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said, he will go for any diversion, any distortion, be it republicanism or the monarchy or the flag, to get away from the real issues because he cannot cope. I know he is up there now having his afternoon nap, and good luck to him. I would like to be having a nap myself. For all the relevance and the importance he attaches to this chamber, he is in the very place he should be. I wonder why he even bothers to come down to Question Time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. They probably realised, after 30 minutes of the honourable member, that there are other places in Canberra worth seeing. In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), it is probably worthwhile spending a bit of time looking at some of the attitudes of the Opposition over recent times in respect of the economy and encouraging economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting when we look at areas such as fiscal policy that the honourable member for Curtin referred to the fact that Budget surpluses were a cyclical phenomenon. That was the claim he made, and that was the reason he gave for the three Budget surpluses in the late eighties. The Opposition has occupied the Treasury bench for something like 30 of the last 40 years and we know that, prior to the late eighties, there had not been a surplus presented to the Parliament by a Government since the beginning of the 1950s. One wonders how long the cycle must have been if the surpluses of the late 1980s were purely a cyclical phenomenon, as the honourable member for Curtin claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then turn to the discussion about interest rates. Ever since the first in the current round of interest rates cuts in February 1990, the gloom and doom that we heard today from the honourable member for Curtin have been expressed by various Opposition spokesmen. They have claimed that we would create a run on the dollar, that we were pushing the pace too quickly, that we would be out of step with the needs of the rest of the world, that we would reignite inflation and so on. But all of those claims have been proved wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only this Government which has broken the back of inflation&mdash;a disease which was endemic throughout the Liberal period in government. The Liberals could never overcome inflation. It did not matter whether the economic tide was turning or whether it was during the 1982-83 recession, at no stage could they get control of inflation. Because they did not have an adequate wages policy, inflation was allowed to run amuck. Inflation was built into the psyche of everyone in the nation during that time. Businesses had to learn to grapple with that inflationary cycle. Indeed, broader problems occurred later because Australia did not develop a proper anti-inflationary strategy in those years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to dealing with the problems which Australia has today. They are acute indeed. In these Appropriation Bills and in the measures which are contained in the Budget and the One Nation statement, it is a case of trying to create the stimulus which is vital in order to get the economy going. We are not approaching this problem with a notion of spending for the sake of spending. We are looking at ways in which we can achieve greater efficiency through training the work force more effectively, providing the training mechanisms to deal with the structural adjustment which has gone on&mdash;and is going on&mdash;in many industries, and through looking at the micro-economic reform measures which are vital to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin said that nothing had been done with regard to micro-economic reform. I wonder what happened in aviation. Substantial reform in that area has contributed to the broader efficiency of the Australian economy. This has been achieved only by a Labor government; it was never touched by the conservatives in their period in office. Indeed, they tightened up the aviation industry in 1983 on the eve of an election which they would inevitably lose. Yet we are told that those opposite have the blueprint for micro-economic reform. Their record does not suggest they have anything of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of telecommunications, again it is this Government which has introduced competition. One has only to pick up a newspaper every day to see the benefits which will flow to the whole of Australia, but particularly business throughout Australia, as a result of the reforms in telecommunications. We then turn to the area of financial deregulation. The honourable member for Curtin says that this Government has failed to tackle micro-economic reform, but financial deregulation certainly fits into that category. We can also look at areas such as the waterfront where there has been a 50 per cent reduction in manning levels as far as coastal shipping is concerned. But we are told that is not a significant reform. Of course, that is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement we have sought to recognise that, by rebuilding national infrastructure&mdash;national rail and road networks and so forth&mdash;we can build efficiency into other areas at the same time. Much of this infrastructure was allowed to fall into decay for decades, and it is an indictment on those opposite that we have not been able to move those projects through as quickly as anyone would wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point of these Appropriations is not to say that we will not continue with the effort to build a national rail network and the efficiency which goes with it in relation to freight movements around the country. We have acknowledged that we cannot do as much in this financial year as was envisaged originally. But we will not lose the benefits of those improvements; they will be carried out over this financial year and the next. At the same time, the stimulus which the economy needs will be applied to other areas this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Opposition's Fightback document, we can see that the Opposition has always underestimated the worth of local government in terms of the national economy. Those opposite have never appreciated the value of working in partnership with local government. The local capital works program is one of the provisions contained in these measures. Additional funding has been brought forward from the 1993-94 financial year to this financial year. It has been clearly shown that this scheme has worked effectively. Local government has picked it up and supported it strongly. It has acknowledged its capacity to help to rebuild parts of the local infrastructure. Local government has acknowledged the part it can play. It is a body which has the capacity to gear up quickly and start the civil works projects which it has on its books and which were in need of funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can nominate all sorts of projects. I have received an update from the Parramatta City Council of the projects it has up and running already. It has not needed to wait, it has them up and running now. These projects are important in terms of the local infrastructure needs in my electorate and they have ramifications for other electorates. Many of the projects that have been approved throughout Australia relate to the tourism industry&mdash;a growth industry which promotes growth in employment. In my electorate alone, something in excess of 1,000 people are employed in the tourism industry. That is an increase from zero in 1983, with the capacity for that number to be increased even further. It will be increased and enhanced by providing a stimulus through infrastructure to encourage more interest in the tourism industry in regions like mine. Many other regions have even greater tourism infrastructure which can be enhanced through local government working with the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The welcoming of such initiatives has not come from just local government; it has come from business organisations, community organisations and environmental groups in the area. A very wide cross-section of people acknowledge that there are opportunities here. These people acknowledge that initiatives can be taken to encourage long term employment growth and to encourage the immediate stimulus that is needed as part of the  building blocks which will enable that very strong industry to develop and prosper in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those things are being achieved because the decision was taken in the Budget&mdash;and the additions that are provided in these Appropriation Bills reflect this decision&mdash;to use local government as a strong lever to get stimulus going. We are told, `No, that is all just pork-barrelling'. That was the concept put to us this afternoon&mdash;that none of this is worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people whose homes are flooded frequently&mdash;and this occurs in parts of my electorate&mdash;and who are not able to get adequate attention from all levels of government to have those problems solved welcome the fact that the Federal Government has at last taken the lead in doing something to solve those problems. The benefit cost of doing those things&mdash;that is, in terms of not having to call on national disaster funds as we have had to do in the past&mdash;will be considerable. We are making an investment by embarking on those projects. They are anything but some sort of pork-barrelling exercise, which was the nonsense that we heard earlier in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the area of training. Again, we are told that labour market initiatives are a waste of money and that they are just positions; they are not real. Could we then say that the formation of the National Training Authority&mdash;the initiative taken in July this year&mdash;falls into the same category? What an absolute nonsense. At long last we will have training in the vocational area of education treated on a proper level. The moneys that are provided in these Appropriation Bills will help to build on those initiatives and help to ensure that there is the financial support to pick up the labour market initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to go to a Jobskill centre or a Skillshare operation and see the successes and the value that have been achieved in terms of people developing technology skills to enable them to gain employment in new areas of the work force, would we say, `That is not a valuable investment by the people of Australia in the futures of young people in this country.'? Of course, we would not say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jobskill project, the Skillshare project and the various labour market programs are providing people with real opportunities. The take-up rate of permanent employment as a result of those programs speaks for itself. That is why the initiatives being taken in these Appropriation Bills to provide that additional $17.54m for entry level training and the $59.1m for labour market assistance to job seekers are very welcome. Packages are being provided to enable employers to take on new employees as part of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite could say that the process that Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox have been going around the country espousing does not have value. That is presumably the net result of the contribution by the honourable member for Curtin. Clearly, employers throughout regions such as western Sydney have recognised that they can play a part. Often the employers are looking to the Government to show its commitment and enthusiasm and to find ways of accessing those programs. There has been strong support for the initiatives that involve additional assistance, where employers are prepared to take on at least 100 people who have been unemployed for six months. The reaction to that announcement a fortnight ago, certainly in my electorate, has been significant. Undoubtedly, there is more scope to improve on those programs as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the upgrading of our road system, it is interesting that Fightback does not give too much clarity as to what the Opposition plans, other to say that it will basically be looking at funding levels equivalent to the 1991-92 year allocation, which is nothing like the investment being made in our road system today&mdash;again, part of building the national efficiency and the competitive opportunities for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite say that the money which is provided by this Appropriation Bill, the additional $30m for black spot road funding, is not a sound investment. I think it is irresponsible of them to make that sort of claim. We are dealing with various segments of road such as those that exist in my electorate, one of which was funded quite recently, where we have had fatalities this year. Those opposite say that spending money to fix those problems is not a priority. That is an outrage in anyone's language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for us to fix up our national road system, partly because of road safety and, secondly, because it helps to improve the efficiency of movement of goods around the country and our trading position. If we want to be internationally competitive in our export industries and so forth, we need to improve our road system and we need to improve the access arrangements of the linkages between the roads and ports, the railheads and ports and so forth. All of those things take time, but what matters is that they are given priority by every government in the country. Every government in the country should be committed to those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does get somewhat difficult when one sees State governments not attaching much priority to the speed with which some of those things are done. Surely, with many of these projects, the plans should be on the drawing board ready to go. There should not be any need for a long gearing up process to occur. We have recognised that in some cases the projects are not moving as quickly as they should. We have said that local government, black spot road funding and labour market programs are areas where real performance is being achieved. We are enhancing those areas to provide long term opportunities from which people will gain as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by the Opposition that funding on sport and community facilities is not a matter of priority. For many people, the provision of infrastructure for those things has important benefits in terms of health, in terms of providing opportunities for children, in terms of providing training facilities for children and in terms of providing the capacity for their interests to be pursued not only in educational hours but also outside school hours and on weekends when many people put in voluntary work. The Opposition says that those things are not really a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The virtue of those projects is that they will ensure employment as they are developed. Last week I visited a project in my electorate of Parramatta that is being funded under the community sporting facilities program. I noted the progress being made in the development of this athletics and hockey complex. I noted the number of children who are taking a keen interest in sports, particularly as a result of Australia's success at the Olympic Games. I also recognised that, for the first time, children from the Parramatta area will have access to proper class facilities in order to develop their instincts and skills. Hopefully, as a result of that, we will have more people who are very enthusiastic about their sport and achieve excellence in sporting activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits in terms of people participating in community and sporting organisations in the youth category should be self-evident. The benefits in terms of the health system by encouraging people to have a healthy lifestyle through participation in sport and associated facilities have been well documented over a long period. Again, it is wrong to claim that those sorts of allocations are purely short term-type initiatives. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the fundamental point of these projects. Many of these schemes are important civil works that local government in particular has not had the resources to undertake. As part of the preparation for the Budget, the Government took up the initiatives and the suggestions of local government throughout Australia because it felt that local government was in a position to play a very important part in Australia's economic and employment recovery. The Government, having obtained the details of many of those projects that local government organisations around Australia said they could develop, took those issues on board. The overwhelming reaction from the community at large has been extremely positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is quite difficult with these debates is that the Opposition comes in here and says that all of these things are a waste of money. Yet, some members of the Opposition who are associated with these areas are the first to get in and try to establish that they deserve the credit for these particular initiatives. That just shows the duplicity that is attached to the Opposition's approach&mdash;that is, to say one thing here, but to try to demonstrate out in the community that they want to be supportive of these initiatives that take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What matters is that the people get the benefit of the facilities that are developed and that the employment which goes with the creation of those facilities is targeted to provide help to those who really need it. In the long term, the whole nation benefits by having projects developed that ensure both a better lifestyle and more opportunities for the people of the regions concerned. Industries such as the tourism industry are also developed as a result of these programs. Tourism is obviously a key one in many areas but there are numerous industries that are helped by these types of programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can say that education does not really matter and that training does not really matter. We could go back to the days of 1983 when it was not considered appropriate for the majority of people to get access to higher education. In 1983, when this Government came to office, in western Sydney only one person in three was able to complete secondary school because no stimulus was given to encourage that to occur. Today over 70 per cent of people are completing secondary school. There are other initiatives, such as vocational training, the development of universities and the broader interest in labour market programs, which are helping enormously in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to ensuring that we provide the maximum help to all Australians as far as economic recovery is concerned. We are determined to deliver that. We are not going to get the projects bogged down by the lethargy of State governments that have not been able to gear up projects quickly enough to get them going; we are not going to let them be bogged down by the attitude of the Opposition that we should delay and not introduce these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have decided, quite properly, that local government and the various schemes that are contained in these Appropriation Bills can deliver important initiatives this financial year. We can pick up the other longer term infrastructure projects next financial year. It is entirely appropriate to finetune the measures in that way. I have much pleasure in supporting these Appropriation Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In listening to the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), I was rather taken by the fact that he seemed very quick to listen to the tired old rhetoric of his Leader but he did not actually do much careful calculation. I heard him say early in his speech that the Labor Party has been in power for only 10 of the last 30 years. By my calculations, as I was sitting here listening, I think it would be somewhat more accurate to say `13 out of the last 20 years'. Maybe that would put a slightly more effective and realistic measure on who is responsible for what has occurred in this country over the last 20 years. For the honourable member for Parramatta to try to give us a history lesson that goes back over the last 30 or 40 years is missing the point and totally misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they are trying to blame someone else. As usual, the honourable member completely overlooks the main problem that is facing this country right now&mdash;a very serious problem&mdash;and that, of course, is unemployment. Not only has he overlooked the problem and the size of the problem but also he was very quick to ignore who has really caused it. There is no doubt&mdash;one cannot go back into history&mdash;that it is the current Government, which has been in office for 10 years. It is in those 10 years that the seeds of the problems we have today have well and truly been sown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talked about some of the reforms that supposedly have occurred. He mentioned the waterfront. Can I say to the honourable member that, while there may have been some progress, it has been at considerable expense, not only to the users of the waterfront, but also to all taxpayers. At the same time, we still have a situation where the charges on our waterfront are anything up to six times as high as the charges in New Zealand. So I am not quite sure where that reform has led in terms of getting the costs down which, presumably, was what waterfront reform was meant to be all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also wanted to talk about road funding. I understand that the honourable member has not been in this chamber all that long, but can I tell him that the run-down in road funding under this Government is nothing short of scandalous. When the current Government came into power, we had a thing called the Bicentennial Road Development Fund. That road development fund led to a significant increase in road funding. It was an initiative of the Fraser Government, not the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983-84 that program has been steadily run down. In fact, until this year, there has been a cut of something like 20 per cent in real terms in the amount of money going into roads&mdash;so much for his talk about what they are really doing for the country&mdash;and there has been a belated recognition in this year that maybe we had better spend a bit more because there is an election coming up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the long suffering road user, the motorist, has seen the fuel excise increase by well over 100 per cent. We have seen the situation where we now have over $7 billion being taken off motorists just in fuel excise. At the same time, the Federal Government is going to spend this year maybe $2 billion, but next year it is planning to run it all down again. In the Forward Estimates, I think, for the year after, it is down to about $1.4 billion, yet the tax will continue, quite contrary to what the coalition is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that the honourable member spent some time attacking the States. He made the comment, `This Government is not going to allow itself to be bogged down by the lethargy of State government'. For the benefit of all honourable members, I draw attention to a very interesting article that talks about the activities of the Trades Hall Council in Victoria. I think it is very illustrative of the problems that have occurred, not under the current Government but, in fact, under the previous Government, the Cain-Kirner Government. When this Government wants to talk about micro-economic reform, it ought to look at the activity not only of the Government in Victoria&mdash;a Labor government&mdash;but at the way one of its senior Cabinet Ministers actually interfered in efforts by that Government to try to bring in some micro-economic reform. When honourable members read that article and see just what happened, maybe they might realise that the Government does not come to this debate with clean hands. Far from it. I will quote a little bit from this article written on 16 October this year by the former Premier, Mr Cain. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a Transport Ministers' meeting in Canberra 1989, Jim Kennan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the then Minister for Transport&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had said the Federal Government was allowing Gerry Hand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the current Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to undermine micro-economic reform in Victorian transport.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words that were printed by Cain earlier last month. They show that back in 1989, in fact when the Cain Government did make an attempt at micro-economic reform, it was none other than a senior Minister in the current Federal Government who was trying to interfere. Mr Cain went on in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to talk about when he spoke to Brian Howe. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I told him that I had spoken to Bob Hawke several times about Gerry Hand and the way he was behaving. I said I believed the Prime Minister should exercise his authority over Gerry and ensure that he stopped undermining the Government's reform program.</PARA>
<PARA>May I just read that again?  Mr Cain said that he asked the Prime Minister to exercise his authority over Gerry and ensure that he stopped undermining the Government's reform program. This is the transport reform program, the one that honourable members are talking about with such vigour today and yet, back in 1989, it was pretty clear, for some anyway, that their heart was not in it. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From what he said, the Prime Minister had not made any attempt to speak with Gerry Hand or to exercise any control over him as he had told me that he would endeavour to do.</PARA>
<PARA>So it was not just the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; it was the then Prime Minister who was sitting on his hands as well when a State government, a Labor State government, a State government of the State that both the Minister and the Prime Minister came from, was, in fact, trying to do some micro-economic reform and neither the Prime Minister nor this Minister was prepared to do anything to assist. In fact, the Minister has been accused by the then Premier of being worse than that, in trying to stop the reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article goes on to talk about the way that the then State Government tried to get around it. It is really quite farcical when one sees what happened. The article talks about trying to get the new tram tickets and the stoppages that were going on throughout Victoria, masterminded by the Trades Hall Council, obviously assisted by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and obviously condoned by the Prime Minister, none other than the Labor Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened?  The Government of Victoria did try. It even went to the trouble, when it found that the printing of the new tickets for the trams was banned in Victoria, to get the work done in South Australia. Likewise, the transport of these tickets was banned. It had to find a way around that. So it actually took the tickets to the retail outlets in the boots of the executive cars. It sounds like high farce. But this was a State government that, at that stage anyway, tried to do something. Is it any wonder, after being let down by its own colleagues in Canberra, that the State Government under Mr Cain started to give it away? Is it any wonder, maybe, that Mr Cain gave it away? Mr Cain has a bit more to say about this which I think is worth bringing to the attention of honourable members. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think on reflection what the MetTicket dispute showed up until the end of January was how far behind national requirements for micro-economic reform the THC was at the time. The mindless number-only approach of transport unions might have been understandable in the climate that those unions had created over a long period of time. For the Trades Hall Council however there is no excuse for such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we see today the same people, the same Trades Hall Council, trying to undermine a new State Government in its efforts to bring in micro-economic reform. What does this present Government do when it talks about its big progress on micro-economic reform?  What does it do when a State government tries to do it?  Having undermined its own colleagues, of course it has not hesitated to encourage its mates in the ACTU to go in to bat with the Trades Hall Council to try to help to undermine yet another attempt by the current State Government to bring in proper micro-economic reform in the area of public transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the former Government had so much trouble?  Is it any wonder that the people of Victoria are currently suffering unnecessarily through all the stoppages that are going on when one finds that there is a direct conduit to the present Federal Government here in Canberra in trying to undermine this micro-economic reform. So much for the efforts of this Government when it talks and brags about micro-economic reform, because when one sees what its actions are, one finds that they are very different. I will just quote one more section from Mr Cain's article. He put it very bluntly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government comes out of this badly. These reforms were the very kinds of reforms that they had been telling us for some time we should be introducing. We agreed. We should have enjoyed the strongest possible support from our federal colleagues. The reverse was the case.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Government:  shame on you. It is a disgrace. It is an absolute disgrace. Government members come into this chamber and try to tell the nation that they are all for micro-economic reform, when their actions, as pointed out by a former colleague in leading a State government, were quite to the contrary. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) earlier today in this place, when we were talking about micro-economic reform, said, `We are undertaking them at a breathtaking pace'. All that I can say is that if it is a breathtaking pace, he must be talking to a snail, because that is the only way a person would have noticed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk specifically about a couple of things in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I think that what I have said is very relevant because it highlights the problems that this Government has created through unemployment and so on, and it also brings to mind just how much the Government is panicking when one looks at some of the facts behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation reappropriates funds from Appropriation Bills (No. 1) and (No. 2) which had not even been passed into law at the time the new statement was made. That is how much the panic has set in; that is why the mismanagement is becoming so clear. It is really quite pathetic. The Budget was only two months old and the Government had to admit that it had miscalculated by at least $174m in the spending program for 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement, the February economic statement, was the sixth economic statement of this Parliament. The Budget is the seventh since February 1990. It shows that the Government is having a statement-led return to this Parliament, a statement-led mess. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in total disarray. By its need to make statement after statement, we can see just how ill thought out the whole approach to the economy is. I might add, for the benefit of all honourable members, that the coalition has made this very clear on many occasions. Yet, because the Government has refused to heed the warnings, we now have nearly one million people out of work, 11.3 per cent of the work force is out of a job, and many of those jobs have been lost through the sheer incompetence of the Government. People must keep asking themselves: how can the Government keep making those mistakes?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the February economic statement do in relation to land transport? It was supposed to create 21,000 jobs in two years, and 15,000 of those were to come from road and 6,000 from rail. Yet we see unemployment keep rising. The Budget has also increased the funding for roads, admittedly from a low base, as I explained earlier. But all of this has failed when it comes to getting the country going again. It is clear that the Government is bereft of ideas. Let us look at some of the primary objectives of this Government and go back to April 1990, when the then Prime Minister wrote a letter to the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Beazley. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our fourth term offers opportunities to quicken the pace of reform . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . explore all options to create and fund a competitive land transport system, and must ensure the best possible return from the huge annual investment in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in April 1990. Some 2 1/2 years later those plans are in total disarray. As Tom Burton said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on the 14th of this month:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adhockery wins again.</PARA>
<PARA>The pace of reform has not quickened. Indeed, One Nation slowed the pace considerably because it was politically motivated, not based on sound planning of the infrastructure needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen many commentators point out time and again the problems with transport reform and the fact that it has not been moving fast enough. Back in April 1991, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is prepared to move quickly and decisively . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Do honourable members not like those words?  He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in cooperation with the states and territories to implement micro-economic reforms in Australia's road and rail sectors . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about the benefits which the Industry Commission estimated would come out of it, such as improvements to land transport or the reform of land transport, which would add $6 billion annually to Australia's GDP. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such substantial gains cannot and will not be ignored by this Government. It makes absolutely no sense to continue to forgo these benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Where are the gains? Where are the benefits? We have not seen too much occur, have we? After all, the Minister talks about the rail reform, and now we have seen the desperate attempt to reallocate this money. We have seen the National Rail Corporation get started. What has it got? It is quite interesting. It has not one but three headquarters. That is quite an achievement: the new Corporation has three headquarters. But guess what: it does not have a train. It has three headquarters and no trains. That is real micro-economic reform!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who caused it indeed? Clearly the Government has to accept the responsibility. We could go on and look at some of the other so-called reforms that are just not occurring. When we look at the problems in Victoria today, it is significant to go back to the article written by the former Premier, Mr Cain. In 1989 he made an attempt to do some micro-economic reform. What did he find? Not only the unions were not going to cooperate, but in fact a senior Minister in this Government was aiding and abetting them and, even further, the then Prime Minister was condoning it by sitting on his hands when he was approached by the Premier asking for assistance. And what did he get? Nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the current State Government in Victoria will be at the forefront of these reforms. We have in Jeff Kennett and Alan Brown, the Minister for Public Transport, two people who are determined to make it work, no matter what this present Government does. When we see the current support that it is giving through the ACTU to the union movement in its efforts to thwart the attempts by the new State Government in Victoria to bring in real economic reform, we have to question its bona fides when it keeps talking about micro-economic reform in relation to transport. We have already seen how it undermined its own colleagues back in 1989. We are now seeing it, through its efforts with the ACTU, trying to undermine the Victorian Government. I merely raise a very serious question: when the Government talks about micro-economic reform, we have to ask it whether it is really serious, or whether it is just rhetoric, like so much of the talk in this place every day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are getting tired of that rhetoric. They are getting tired of a Government that ignores the problems. It is clear that the Government has failed. It has no new ideas, no new plans, no new policies; it is just lurching from disaster to disaster. As my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) pointed out, the Government is now trying to think up a new stunt every week to distract people's attention from the problems that it has created, to try to make people think that the one million unemployed will somehow go away, although of course it will not. It has all the hallmarks of a government that is seriously in decay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like it or not, I say to the members of the Government: they have one million people unemployed in this country and the question is: when are they going to start doing something about it instead of just talking about it? It is clear that they have failed to deliver in reform; their economic management is appalling; the One Nation statement has failed; the Budget has failed; and these Appropriation Bills are just further symptoms of their incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the recession continues, the debt climbs, and all we see is panic setting in. As I said earlier this month in my speech on a matter of public importance, while the Government may think what it is doing is good politics, it sure as hell is not good government. I do not think these Bills even reflect good politics, and they reflect even worse government. Labor members should hang their heads in shame. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has just delivered a speech which has next to nothing to do with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), but I will spend a moment replying to one or two of the things he said because they are worth responding to. One of the central points he was trying to make was his claim that the Government was opposed to micro-economic reform because it was opposing the industrial relations package in Victoria. This is the first time that I have heard micro-economic reform equated to exploitation. I would have thought that the industrial relations package in Victoria ought to be evaluated as to what it purports to be: a way of managing industrial relations. It involves removing most of the protection that employees in Australia have had during most of the last century, and shifting the power in the employment situation to employers so that they can then impose any kinds of conditions on their employees. That amounts to exploitation. That is not micro-economic reform; it is just a way of ensuring that injustice predominates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely responsible, economically and in terms of social justice, for the Victorian union movement to reject that completely, and for everyone else in Australia who has any sense of commitment to good government, to consensual politics and to the resolution of disputes to oppose it so that it is eventually abandoned. If we are to have a just society in Australia, it is essential that the Victorian industrial relations package be defeated. To equate it with micro-economic reform is simply nonsense. The Federal Government's record of micro-economic reform is very impressive. I will not be dragged into a detailed recitation of it, except to say that there have been figures released again this week on the 20 per cent improvement in productivity on the waterfront during the last year. The honourable member for Wannon completely neglects that sort of achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to the Bills, because it is the Bills that we ought to be talking about. These Bills are about the continuing strategy of the Government to increase employment. The One Nation statement, the Budget and now these Bills have all been aimed centrally at maximising the rate of growth of employment. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Wannon say that he was concerned about employment. I wish he would demonstrate that in what he says, and I wish he would urge his own Party to adopt that as its central goal, because the effect of what it is proposing would be to increase unemployment further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the last few days rejecting the idea of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy at a time when, it is true, the economy is recessed. It is absurd for the Opposition to imagine that it can assist the economy to recover by further reducing government expenditure. Every Western country which is aiming for growth in employment and economic growth is introducing stimulatory policies. The President-elect of the United States, Mr Clinton, is committed to the expansion of government outlays in well-targeted ways which will build up the rate of economic activity and productivity in America. He is planning to increase outlays on infrastructure, on education, and on research&mdash;on the programs which will assist the improvement of productivity at the same time as they assist economic recovery. Mr Clinton is leading the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan introduced a major expansionary package a few months ago. The British Conservative Government, to whom the Opposition commonly looks for its guidance and for precedents, has just brought in another expansionary package. It has increased the proportion of national income passing through the public sector, through public outlays, by 4 per cent. It has increased public outlays from 42 per cent of its national income to 46 per cent in the last 18 months as a way of stimulating economic activity. Yet we have the Opposition feeling that it is cleverer than all the rest of the world, that it can act in a way which every other country would regard as perverse, and that in some way that will magically assist recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot take its set of proposals seriously. They did not work during the Great Depression. Those were the kinds of policies that were adopted in Australia, the United States and Britain in the early part of the Great Depression, and what did they do? They drove those countries deeper into depression. Adopting the same policies here&mdash;cutting government outlays and cutting wages, as the Opposition proposes to do&mdash;would drive the Australian economy, in the same way they did in the early 1930s, deeper into depression. We have to reject those policies conclusively and wholeheartedly and adopt, encourage and reinforce the well-targeted policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, impressively, has responded effectively and in responsible, well-modulated ways to the recession. Of course we regret the recession. Of course unemployment is disastrously high. Of course that is a great tragedy. Of course, though, it is partly due to what has happened in the rest of the world. I will refer to some figures in a minute that show that much of the rest of the Western world is even more deeply recessed than Australia. But the Government has responded in responsible, well-targeted ways to that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1989-90, the Government has switched from a Budget surplus to a Budget deficit. The Budget surplus in 1989-90 was $8 billion; this year the deficit will be in the region of $15 billion. That is a switch equivalent to about 5 per cent of GDP. Some of us might have liked that deficit to be a bit larger still, but one has to accept entirely that a switch of 5 per cent is a major and quite dramatic change. It will steadily have an impact on the level of economic activity&mdash;it is already doing so, in ways which I will refer to in a moment&mdash;and it will steadily reduce unemployment. There is no doubt that more than simply changes of macro policy are involved in moving towards full employment again, but getting macro policy right is a necessary and perhaps the principal condition that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is one step towards further implementing the expansionary strategy which was adopted in the One Nation statement and reinforced in the Budget in August. I do not find any difficulty in entirely defending the Government for trying to switch expenditure to the areas in which it will be most effective. The honourable member for Wannon tried to say that it was because of inadequacy that such a switch had to occur. I would have thought that any reasonable person would recognise that sometimes programs cannot be implemented as quickly as one would like. There are major planning processes, negotiations, and ordering and tendering procedures that have to be gone through before large projects can be brought into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation embodies some shifting of funds from areas in which there will be some delays into areas in which the funds can be effectively spent quickly, particularly areas of direct employment creation such as local government programs, programs through regional authorities, large enterprises that can take on more of the long term unemployed, and road funding. The honourable member criticised the Government for its expenditure on road funding. I was astonished by that. The major element of the infrastructure spending in the One Nation package was an additional $600m for roads. How much would the Opposition spend if ever it had the opportunity? All it talks about is cutting government outlays. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot criticise the Government for not spending enough and announce it will spend even less. So this is entirely appropriate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to describe the Government's strategy using some figures on economic policy that have just been published and which I do not think have been used in debate in this House. They are the figures that are produced annually by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on government financial estimates. They draw together the Budgets of the Commonwealth and the States and show how they will affect the economy on a standardised basis. These figures show, I am glad to say, that the Commonwealth is giving the Australian economy a major stimulus. The ABS estimates that the deficit in 1992-93 will be $15 billion. That is a very substantial stimulus. Last year the deficit was just over $10 billion. It is a bigger stimulus; it will, therefore, have a bigger effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when inflation and our government debt is the lowest in the Western world&mdash;two facts that the Opposition seems to neglect but which, I am very glad to say, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been quite rightly emphasising&mdash;at a time when the two most important conditions which have to be met in order to justify a major expansionary fiscal policy are in place, the Government has seized the opportunity and is adopting a stimulatory stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will dwell on debt for a moment, as it is under-recognised in the wider community. The wider community tends to be oppressed by the size of our overseas debt, which is a significant problem. It is very important to turn the current account deficit around. At present in public debate we normally fail to recognise that Australian government debt is the lowest in the Western world as a proportion of our gross domestic product. Our government debt as a proportion of gross domestic product in the last year, for which figures were published by the OECD, was 16 per cent. No country had a lower percentage of government debt than that. That figure includes not only the debts of the Commonwealth but also the debts of the States and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is another way of pointing out that there is no crisis in Victoria. The Victorian Government debt as a proportion of state product is the second lowest in the Western world. It is only 26 per cent of state product, which is amazingly low. It is true that it is higher than some of the other States, but it is lower than in most other countries. Japan, for example, has a government debt to GDP ratio of over 100 per cent; Britain has one of just under 50 per cent; and Germany has one of about 60 per cent. I do not have the figures in front of me, but those are the orders of magnitude. All of them are much higher than the Australian or Victorian Government figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get this into perspective. There is no crisis anywhere in Australia about government debt. It is true that it is always better to have lower debts because we have less to repay and less to service, but at a time when the Government debt is so low, getting it down further is not a priority. The priority at present is to stimulate employment and economic activity, and that is exactly what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures published by the ABS show that current outlays by the Commonwealth this year are expected to rise by 6.7 per cent. Outlays by the States and local government sector are expected to rise by 4.3 per cent. That is a good complementary activity by them. Capital outlays by the Commonwealth are expected to rise by 16 per cent. That is a direct result of the One Nation statement, exactly what we want because it targets the need to build up activity in ways which will also contribute to building up productivity. Capital outlays by the States and local governments are expected to rise by 15 per cent. So again we have a complementary stimulus from the States, which is very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in Commonwealth outlays is partly concentrated in social security and welfare, which is what one would expect at a time of high unemployment because high unemployment requires a high level of income support for the unemployed. There are small increases for health and education, which are very welcome in themselves. The growth in education spending is one of the features of the Budget which will contribute directly to the improvement of the skills of the work force, and that is very valuable. I could continue going through the figures, but there are a couple of other things I want to talk about before my time runs out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will draw the attention of members of the Opposition to some forecasts which the Prime Minister mentioned earlier in the week, which were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> last week. According to a group of authoritative and influential forecasters, Australia is expected to have a faster rate of economic growth this year and in 1993 than any other Western country. Those opposite talk about collapse, decay and so on. That is absolute nonsense. The facts simply do not support their case. The effect of good government policies, a stimulatory Budget, low inflation and a responsibly accommodating monetary policy</PARA>
<PARA>is that economic growth in Australia is recoering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 these forecasters, who come from the United States, Japan, Britain and other places in Western Europe&mdash;they are averaged so that they draw together forecasts from a whole series of different sources&mdash;on average estimate a real growth of GDP in Australia to be 2.1 per cent in 1992, which is faster, as I have said, than any other country. In Britain, the economy is in decline. It is expected to go down by 0.9 per cent. In a number of other countries that is true. In those countries where there is growth, growth is slower than it is in Australia. In Germany it is expected to be 1.1 per cent and in the United States it is expected to be 1.7 per cent. All those figures are lower than that of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year there is mostly expected to be somewhat faster growth, but only moderately so, I regret to say. Again, the growth rate in Australia is expected to be faster than anywhere else&mdash;3.4 per cent compared with 2.3 per cent in the United States, 1.2 per cent in the United Kingdom, 0.6 per cent in Germany, and so on. Growth in Australia will lead to growth in employment and a reduction in unemployment, which is what we are already starting to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by drawing attention to the latest job report which has come out from the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training and which goes through its assessment of the labour market situation. It found in the September quarter of 1992 that CES job vacancies and job placements were the highest recorded for any quarter for the last two years. So stimulatory policies are starting to lead to growth in the number of vacancies and growth in the number of job placements. That is exactly the kind of hopeful sign we have been looking for. As well as that, the job report concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compared with the same period in 1991, vacancies increased in all industry categories in all States, with the strongest increases in SA, Victoria and WA and the weakest in NSW, Tasmania and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very encouraging. It is exactly the kind of positive news we would expect to receive at a time when stimulatory policies are being adopted. That is now starting to happen. As well as that, the job report shows that the number of placements in labour market programs organised by the Department are very positive as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these very constructive reasons, it is a delight to be able to support this very positive and responsible Bill which puts more funds into those areas where employment growth can be stimulated most quickly and most directly. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to talk about Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). Before I begin my speech, I refer to the speech made before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) made a couple of extraordinary points. I was staggered to hear him say&mdash;and this is quite unbelievable&mdash;that there is no problem with debt in Australia. He then went on to say that there is no problem with debt in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Victorian, I have to say that the new Victorian Government has a somewhat different attitude and the Victorian voters have a somewhat different attitude. It seems to me that the honourable member for Fraser does not understand the basics. Victoria has got itself into an extraordinary situation. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was so ashamed of its financial efforts that he failed to show the $1.2 billion in the last Budget Papers. It was pushed conveniently to one side; it did not exist. When a State government borrows money and then uses the borrowings to pay interest on loans, how can the honourable member for Fraser say that it has no problems with debt? One wonders what financial school he went to: it was obviously the school that pays American Express with Bankcard and Bankcard with Visa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never heard so much nonsense from a member of this place. For him to say that there is no problem with debt shows that he does not understand the fundamentals. Debt has to be paid back sooner or later by somebody. The tragedy in Australia today is that the $180 billion deficit that we owe as a nation will be paid back largely by our children and our grandchildren. Anyone who has been part of this Government for the last decade, who has seen that debt run from $30 billion to $180 billion, ought to hang his or her head in shame at that particular record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will reallocate $150m of railway expenditure and $24m of electricity expenditure to other areas of the Budget. It is fairly obvious that, even though the Budget was brought down only a couple of months ago, we have a government in shambles. Why in such an extremely short time is the only two-months-old Budget already out of date? The Government already has to reallocate moneys&mdash;duck and shove. Maybe we have an election coming on! Who knows? Maybe the Government will try to get unemployment down by taking money from infrastructure and putting it into artificial job creation schemes. It is a worry when a government takes huge amounts of money, pokes them around and plays ducks and drakes instead of governing this country as it is charged to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A press release from the Treasurer dated 13 November, in which he announced this relocation program, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We expect a total of 20,000 new positions to be created or brought forward as a result of these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds reasonable until one looks at the record. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Government is offering an enhanced package of assistance to every major employer in this country willing to employ full-time at least an additional 100 persons who have been unemployed for at least six months or who qualify as young trainees. The same offer will apply to incorporated regional authorities proposing to employ full-time at least an additional 200 persons.</PARA>
<PARA>On reading this, the flavour of this Government comes out again: big government, big business, big unions. That is the thrust of it. Government members do not care about the little man; they do not care about small business, which is the backbone of this country. They just go down that line of looking after their mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found one bright spot in this reallocation of money, and it is in relation to road funding. This press release talks about the black spot program. An extra $30m is being added to the road funding program to improve black spot areas. I am pleased that the Princess Highway running from Pakenham in the west of my electorate through to Traralgon is being duplicated. Those sections that have not been duplicated in the last two years have the tragic record of 10 deaths. I find that a tragedy, which I hope we can overcome by duplicating that freeway and other parts of Australia as quickly as possible. We must all pull together to reduce the carnage on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation is supposed to be a package to create jobs. But what did the Government do? It picked the place that has the highest level of employment in Australia&mdash;Canberra&mdash;to allocate $1.25m for the refurbishment of old Parliament House. For the Government to allocate $1.25m for the refurbishment of old Parliament House in an area that has high employment in the middle of the worst recession in 60 years is quite frankly a disgrace. What standards has the Government set by allocating $1.25m to this project? It seems crazy on any criteria for the Government to allocate this money to an area of high employment compared with the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it beholden upon me to look back at the One Nation speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February to see the record and what was proposed. It was an interesting speech, made on 26 February, a little under 12 months ago. It starts as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I became Prime Minister a little over two months ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight we turn those words into action. Tonight the Government presents a Statement to get Australia moving&mdash;a four year strategy for growth in the nineties.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were big words. The next page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A four-year plan</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's plan for the next four years will create over 800 000 jobs, without increasing the current account deficit and at the same time returning the budget to surplus and Australia to growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sick when one thinks about the reality of what has actually happened. It goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have a $2.3 billion dollar plan for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, tonight's Statement contains great initiatives. I believe, historic initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Measures big enough to kickstart the economy and get things going. Big enough to get people back to work.</PARA>
<PARA>This was in February this year. It is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And big enough to stir the imagination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But our program will do more than speed our recovery from recession&mdash;it will build the Australia of the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will help our young people now; and it will still be helping them when they raise their own children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Building on our advantages and the great gains we made in the `80s, it will make us much stronger.</PARA>
<PARA>People cannot believe that this statement was made by the Prime Minister on 26 February this year when they look at the Government's miserable record&mdash;where unemployment has gone to 11.3 per cent. Underemployment adds dramatically to that figure. Yet the Prime Minister still has the audacity to come into this place and say, time after time, how proud he is of the record. He should be ashamed of himself. Under the heading `The Big Projects' he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, for much of our history Australia has been disadvantaged by the great distances which separate us. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our major population centres were&mdash;and remain&mdash;hundreds of kilometres apart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our lines of supply were long: the costs of transport high.</PARA>
<PARA>Why does the Prime Minister not take out the fuel excise? One simple move, as per Fightback, and the tyranny of distance would come down. He then talks about the workplace, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, a nation cannot be strong if at the very point where wealth is made&mdash;the workplace&mdash;people are locked in conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>But in the last fortnight we find him standing up in the House being proud of the recycled communist in Victoria&mdash;Halfpenny&mdash;leading strikes against a duly elected government with a mandate to reform the workplace. This Prime Minister goes down the track of supporting such a man. He went on to say something about industrial relations which I agree with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But basic standards must be met. We will not support slashing minimum wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is strange that he says that because the average income in real terms in Australia has dropped by 1 1/2 per cent over the last 12 months, the period since this document came out. Unlike the Prime Minister's document, with Fightback we believe in a genuine high wage policy that will give average workers the freedom to do something about looking after their own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards that end, I thought it would be interesting to briefly run through a speech given by Terence Ward, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Heinz Australia in Dandenong. It is interesting to note that the Heinz company has just bought out Watties New Zealand. Heinz Australia is a manufacturing food company which has a $230m turnover. Watties has a $540m turnover, so they are roughly comparable. In a speech to the primary industry committee of the Opposition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some time Australian food processing companies have been conscious of the lower cost structures which apply in New Zealand. Average weekly ordinary time earnings in the fruit and vegetable industry are about 73% of comparable Australian rates. Labour on-costs in Australia which include payroll tax, workcare premiums, rostered days off, sick leave, long service leave, annual leave provisions, annual leave loadings, and shift premiums add 33% to wage costs; whereas in New Zealand the figure is closer to 16%. In total the cost of employing people in New Zealand is only 64% of what it is here.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business is also attracted by the opportunities afforded by the New Zealand's deregulated labour market. The ability to negotiate on shift loadings and weekend penalty rates can make it feasible to operate a factory twice the number of hours that is economically viable in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .. . .<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="FLUSH-RIGHT">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deregulation of energy, shipping, ports and transport is progressively reducing the costs of these services in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .. . .<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="FLUSH-RIGHT">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is considered that New Zealand is a significantly lower cost base than Australia for exports to Asian and South Pacific countries.</PARA>
<PARA>. . .. . .<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="FLUSH-RIGHT">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we wish to grow our Australian business and expand our exports into Asia we have to improve our competitiveness compared with our new New Zealand affiliate, and this is a significant challenge for us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot succeed unless the environment in which we are operating in Australia becomes less unfavourable compared with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>He is talking about government policies. He goes on to recommend the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government charges&mdash;particularly payroll tax must be reduced or eliminated and probably, as in New Zealand, the only way this can be accomplished is through the imposition of a Goods and Services Tax.</PARA>
<PARA>This is said by the Managing Director of a company which has a company in Australia, Heinz Australia, and Watties New Zealand. He is comparing like with like and is saying quite clearly that if we keep going down this track with the nation that we used to think of as a basket case and a bit of a joke 10 years ago, we will export Australian jobs to New Zealand as well as to other parts of Asia. As part of his speech he makes the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour contracts must be deregulated&mdash;as is happening here but too slowly. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister, who tells us that voluntary employment agreements are wonderful, Mr Ward says they are happening much too slowly. One of the final indictments he has of the Government's policy is when he says that transport is a big cost in the tomato industry. Heinz is a great producer of tomato paste. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tomatoes have to be carried from farm to factory and finished products shipped to markets in the cities, usually some distance from the rural based factories. The per kilometre cost of carting tomatoes is twice as high in Victoria as&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>wait for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in California as a consequence of Government imposts on fuel prices and we welcome the Coalitions' intentions to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>This man, a great Australian, who is at the coalface of creating jobs, is saying very clearly that, under current Government policies, he has no other option but to export jobs from this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to him about the Dandenong plant. I asked about its future, given the bad industrial relations record of a couple of years ago when it had hundreds of tonnes of tomatoes rotting in its store. I said, `Will you relocate somewhere else in Australia to a greenfield site?'. The answer was `No'. Quite clearly it meant that if Heinz Dandenong is to shift, it will shift offshore. This is a tragedy when we look at the One Nation policy that this Government has brought out, which says that it is a wonderful policy and that it is on track. The trouble is the track is a disastrous one and is leading this great nation to rack and ruin. We have a Prime Minister who will say anything or do anything to maintain his own job at the expense of so many young Australians: it is something he should be ashamed of. It was interesting to pick up today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and find, under the headline `Australia 10 years behind NZ&mdash;Myers', that it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leading New Zealand businessman Douglas Myers says Australia's economic and industrial reforms are moving far too slowly&mdash;so slowly they are a decade behind. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article finishes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Studies showed New Zealand's productivity was now around 30 per cent better than Australia's and wages had risen marginally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Myers said the goods and service tax was a non-issue in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Labour Government (which introduced the tax)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in New Zealand&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">won the argument by getting out and showing people that, compared with alternatives, a tax mix including GST was a better and fair system." he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It seems odd that a tax adopted by most OECD countries, including the Catholic countries of Europe, should arouse such passion among church and welfare lobbies in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. The evidence is in black and white from those at the coalface that what the Prime Minister is doing with jobs in Australia, and with Australia's future, is just more of the disastrous same of the last 10 years and he should be thoroughly condemned, as I have no doubt he will be at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reasons for Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) have been well canvassed, not only in the second reading speech by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) but also in the speeches that have preceded my contribution in this debate. It is perhaps in the best interests of the House if we reflect on the issues that are involved in why we find ourselves in this position. Partisan politics aside, what we should consider is that a genuine effort was made in the One Nation statement to allocate funds to worthwhile infrastructure projects. These projects involve the Commonwealth's sitting down with the State governments and coming to an agreement about process and about implementation. If we consider that the process has been slow leading to the reallocation of these moneys, it is a slight indictment of the way that our federal system operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is further emphasised that in the reallocation of these funds the measures announced in the Budget, involving further infrastructure projects, this time aimed through local government, have proved so successful that we can consider changes that would involve that sphere of government even more. It is really a challenge for Australia to come to grips with the way in which the three spheres of government relate to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in my contribution&mdash;I do not think the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) will be surprised at this&mdash;I will mention what is happening in Victoria. But, even giving that case as an extreme example, Australia's future demands that we improve upon the system left to us by those who framed the Constitution, some 100 years ago, to bind together six colonies of the British Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision of yesterday about other matters within the Constitution has evoked a great deal of comment; some, I might say, has not been complimentary of the High Court itself. But I do not totally agree with those who make those comments because I think that what is at fault is the Constitution on which the High Court had to make its judgments. The sooner the Australian people understand that and can look at the Constitution and constitutional change with maturity, the better. What we need to do is to look at a constitutional framework for this nation that best suits it not only in the 1990s but into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members have acknowledged in their speeches in this cognate debate, the reallocation of moneys in these Bills involves not only the bringing forward of local capital works program money allocated for the next year but also allocating moneys for black spot eradication projects and other very worthwhile infrastructure projects of that kind. I was disappointed with the statement by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) about the allocation of funds for the refurbishment of the old Parliament House. On previous occasions in this place, I have urged the Government to take action to find a use for the old Parliament House, the provisional Parliament House. On those occasions I have suggested that it could, in some form, be used as a place of historical education about a whole host of things associated with the constitutional development of this nation and parliamentary democracy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am pleased that the Government has seen fit to take the step to allocate this money. Millions of people have visited this building since its opening. If visitors were able to go down and have a look at the provisional Parliament House, that would be an additional experience, and an educational experience, while visiting Canberra. I do not think we should look at things in a parochial way. There are regional imbalances in the way in which unemployment has hit different parts of Australia. We must realise that there are reasons for funding worthwhile projects that, in addition, will lead to worthwhile employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election that will occur next year will be an election of contrasts. It will be an election that shows the different approaches of the Government and the Opposition. It will be a contest between the Government, which sees it as quite correct to be, in part, expansionary and to provide stimulus to the economy, and a government that would contract government outlays and be very contractionary in the way it looked at its Budget. It will be a contrast between the Government, which sees that there is a need to move, in not only the long term but also the short to medium term, on the aspect of unemployment, and the Opposition, which would offer the Australian public measures, the benefits of which, if any, on the unemployment and employment situation would be very much long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of new tax being offered by the Opposition needs further explanation, and not only in the sense of marketing and selling a product, for the Australian public to be convinced that it will in any way create employment because, really, it is just a rejigging of the tax regime. As has been repeated often, and was repeated today in Question Time by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the GST, by being a value added tax, can be seen as a tax on the labour input of goods and services provided. In that regard it provides no encouragement at all on the labour input side of goods and services. That is something that the Australian public is acutely aware of and will give good consideration to before deciding who they will be supporting at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the contrasts go even further. The behaviour of the Kennett Liberal Government in Victoria gives Australians an opportunity to have a glimpse at what life might be like in the unlikely and unfortunate event of the election of a Hewson coalition government. It is a very sobering experience to consider what those changes could be. After only a few weeks since the change of government in Victoria, Australians can see that putting a Kennett clone in Canberra&mdash;or is it the Hewson clone in Spring Street?&mdash;would have a distinct effect on their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let us look at the way local government has been treated. As the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) said in Question Time today, there has been a blatant disregard by the Kennett Government for consultation with local government and involving it in the collection of the new tax that that Government has put in place&mdash;a blatant disregard and lack of consideration of the democratic rights and freedoms of institutions such as local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax itself is another example of a pernicious and inequitable tax. It is a flat tax, a regressive tax. Already there have been savage and unnecessary cuts in government services, again characterised by the haste with which they have been announced&mdash;haste which has led to very little, if any, consultation with the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian public can now have a glimpse of the future by observing Victoria with its industrial mayhem which has followed the hasty actions of the Kennett Government. But why, we must ask, is it deemed necessary to institute the type of ideologically driven measures that we have seen, the narrow-mindedness that has never been seen before? It reminds us that the Liberal Party always governs in the interests of only part of the community. Honourable members from Victoria know that the community is gripped with fear&mdash;the fear of what cuts will come next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we have seen the announcement of school closures, which will mean thousands upon thousands of jobs disappearing and people's democratic rights of protection under awards and their hard-won conditions of employment ripped away. We have seen the introduction of the so-called deficit levy, a pernicious community charge likened to a poll tax. In several ways it is akin to a GST: a flat tax that pays no regard to people's ability to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reminded by the release of Paul Kelly's book about politics in the eighties of John Elliott's unsuccessful efforts when he was President of the Liberal Party. This led me to recall a speech I made in 1988 at a time when John Elliott used his position as Federal President of the Liberal Party to enter into policy debate. The John Elliott of that period was very much a Thatcher acolyte. He talked of billion dollar cuts to government outlays and of a consumption tax. It is interesting that at that time we contemplated that the Liberal Party was talking about a consumption tax of 5 to 7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the assistance of some well-guided research, at that time I asked this House what was next, what next the likes of John Elliott would consider from Thatcher's Britain. I put it to the House that perhaps a poll tax would be considered. When the Kennett Government announced its poll tax, those words came back to me. It is a prescription straight from the now discredited Thatcher handbook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the poll tax so objectionable? Firstly, as I have said, it is the result of a State sphere of government treating another sphere of government with utter contempt and disdain. As the Minister for Local Government said earlier today in Question Time, it shows a complete disregard for any pretence of partnership. There was no consultation; councils were just told that the notices would be sent out and that they then had a debt to the State of $100 times the number of rateable properties. Local governments were told that, even if they did not collect all the amount they were told to collect by a certain date, they would have to pay it, and pay it not only from the collection of this objectionable tax but out of their rate revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element that makes this entirely objectionable is the fact that there is a complete lack of equity in the way it is applied. The people of my electorate clearly understand that this poll tax is inequitable. They know that a family of six on minimum wages, living in a weatherboard home in Thomastown, will pay the same as the owner of a multimillion dollar mansion in Toorak. I am sure that not only most Victorians but most Australians would instinctively understand that this is not fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who thinks it is a good idea that the rich pay the same as the poor&mdash;or some of them at least, particularly those responsible for developing Liberal Party policy? Here again all Australians can learn a valuable lesson from the punishment inflicted on Victorians by Jeff Kennett. The ideology which led to this pernicious poll tax on Victorians is the same as the concoction of academic waffle known as Fightback. As my research into what John Elliot was considering shows, perhaps it is not even original waffle, but waffle that has been around for quite some time. It has been tried under Thatcher in Britain, tried under Reagan in the United States, and in both cases there is no evidence to suggest that it was tried with success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback has as its centrepiece another flat tax, another consumption tax&mdash;a goods and services tax&mdash;and, like Mr Kennett's poll tax, it can be seen to be unfair and to strike the disadvantaged with much more severity. Look at some of the cuts that the Kennett Liberal Government has already announced. Last Friday we had the announcement of school closures. It was announced that over 50 schools will close at the commencement of next year. I know many of these schools well; many are in disadvantaged areas. Not one word has been said about the impact on the resources of nearby schools of the displaced school populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No consideration has been given to the special education facilities that will be lost by the closure of secondary colleges such as the Northland Secondary College, which has been acknowledged as having great regard for the disadvantaged people of the area it serves. No regard has been given to where the 318 students of schools such as Keon Park Secondary College will have an educational opportunity when school commences next year. Those 318 pupils will have to be absorbed into nearby schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Northland Secondary College, 475 students, within a month, will have to decide where they might take up their educational opportunity. Both these schools are surrounded by secondary colleges which are already finding it very difficult to find appropriate resources to look after the student loads that they have. Greensborough Secondary College is another school in the local area to suffer. There the senior campus has been closed. The school council has already had to contemplate how it will find places for the students of that senior campus. Places will have to be found and new school buildings put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other areas are lined up for cuts&mdash;whether it be third groups in kindergartens or whether it be the unknown as to what the Kennett Government will do under the national child care policy that had been worked out previously. What will happen to railway lines such as the Hurstbridge line where there have been rumours of a closure? That is not the way the Government should go. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill reintroduces part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992&mdash;the provisions to licence subscription television broadcasting services, or pay TV. As we are all aware this section was removed from the original Bill by the Opposition parties in the Senate chamber four months ago. Dismay was expressed at the time that pay TV may never again emerge from the `black hole' of the Senate committee system to which it was referred. However, the Committee acted expeditiously to complete its hearings and bring down its report which was tabled in this chamber on September 16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee sought to resolve two major issues: how and when pay TV service licences would be issued; and how best the ABC could participate in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite its best endeavours the Committee did not provide the Government with a ready solution to the impasse on pay TV. The debate has moved on even since the Committee tabled its report. Optus recently advised the Government it now intends to move to digital transmission as soon as the technology is available. It proposes to sell channels not transponders. Most potential bidders for a licence have also informed the Government they will wait for digital technology on satellites before starting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government therefore proposes to mandate the use of digital technology for pay TV using Optus satellites. Opting for digital satellite systems will place Australia at the forefront of world developments in direct-to-home satellite broadcasting technology.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Current licence conditions on Optus only require it to make available six channels for pay TV until mid-1994. Optus has agreed to provide satellite capacity for up to 10 pay TV program services until 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To allocate this capacity equitably, and recognising the  commercial requirements of this new industry, the Government intends to issue two commercial licences A and B to provide up to four pay TV program channels on the Optus satellite. These will be issued simultaneously using a price based allocation system under the provisions at section 93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The choice of the digital system will be a joint decision by licensees A and B in consultation with Optus. It is important that this decision is left to the commercial judgement of the operators because of the significant cost involved in the reception technology and the extent to which it can be adapted to meet licensee needs&mdash;for example, pay-per-view, interactivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system chosen will be used by, and accessible to, all satellite pay TV service providers. The chosen system will then be set as a standard by the Minister for Transport and Communications under section 94(1). Any disagreement will be arbitrated by the Minister. No further satellite pay TV licences, other than that for the ABC which I will outline in a moment, will be sold before 1 July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence section 96(3) states that the Australian Broadcasting Authority must not, before that date, allocate a satellite licence. Satellite pay TV licences issued after that date will be allocated under the provisions of section 96 for single program services, with the Trade Practices Act operating to govern ownership limits. It is important to note there will be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver pay TV such as cable or microwave&mdash;MDS. They will be licensed under section 96. These will be vetted by the Trade Practices Commission under section 97 before licences are issued to ensure competition policy objectives are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to turn to the role of the ABC in the proposed pay TV industry. The Government has always sought to have the ABC participate in a sensible, commercial manner with three vitally important caveats:</PARA>
<PARA>.the ABC's core free to air TV services suffer no detriment. </PARA>
<PARA>.the taxpayer not be exposed to any financial risk from ABC involvement. </PARA>
<PARA>.the ABC board accept responsibility for the extent of the national broadcaster's involvement, given its fiduciary duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill provides at section 93(2) that a third licence&mdash;licence C&mdash;to provide up to two pay TV services be allocated to a subsidiary of the ABC. The Government will maintain its earlier commitment to give the ABC $12.5m in seed finance. The extent to which the ABC participates in pay TV, forms commercial relationships with licensee A and/or B and other subscription service providers, and the nature and extent of programming will be left to the discretion of the ABC board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To minimise the risk to the Commonwealth from the ABC's involvement the Government will use ministerial powers to set licence conditions under section 93(3) to require it:</PARA>
<PARA>.to operate its pay TV services through a subsidiary company with a separate board;</PARA>
<PARA>.to require that borrowings of its subsidiary over $2m are guaranteed only with ministerial approval;</PARA>
<PARA>.to require that an approved charging regime be developed for use of ABC assets and for goods and services provided to its subsidiary; and</PARA>
<PARA>.to require that an accounting regime on a fully attributed cost basis be developed that fully brings to account profits and losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cross-media ownership limits will apply to licence A at sections 106 to 108 of the Bill. These will prevent control and allow a maximum of 2 per cent equity for commercial television broadcasters, large circulation newspapers and the telecommunications carriers. These provisions facilitate diversity in media ownership by allowing at least one new player in Australia's media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is confident there will be a number of bidders for this licence. No ownership and control restrictions will be applied to newspapers, incumbent commercial television licensees and telecommunications carriers participating in licence B. This is to offset the special treatment given to the ABC and to allow the structural adjustment of the incumbent commercial television licensees to the new medium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not intend to place a legislative straitjacket on the ABC. Either or both licensee A and B can participate with the ABC in licence C subject to any conditions specified by the Minister for Transport and Communications and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. However, it is intended that a condition be set by the Minister, at section 93(3), that the ABC must retain a majority equity holding in its licence at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 110 provides that neither licensee A nor licensee B can control or hold more than 2 per cent equity in each other. The 2 per cent limit minimises the opportunity to manipulate the ownership limits as a defence against hostile takeovers. It does not penalise business where a small parcel of shares is acquired inadvertently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign ownership limits at section 109 are to be the same as those proposed earlier&mdash;that is, no more than 20 per cent individual and 35 per cent aggregate foreign holdings in any subscription television broadcasting licence, not just the satellite licences. The Government considers that the Senate Committee's recommendation to increase program expenditure on Australian drama content on all predominantly drama channels to 15 per cent is unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 102 confirms our earlier decision by placing a 10 per cent program expenditure requirement on satellite drama services, but has expanded it to all drama services irrespective of the delivery technology. This Bill places several imposts on the new industry that will add to the cost of pay TV. It will take some years before pay TV services reach break-even. To impose further expenditure requirements on them could threaten their commercial viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opportunities for Australian production are enhanced under this model. There are more channels available and three licences in the market from day one. Australian content requirements will also be reviewed in line with provisions at section 215(b) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Special Broadcasting Service can choose to participate in pay TV. It could do this by being a provider of programs to pay TV operators or by participating in commercial arrangements for the provision of satellite and other subscription services. As with the ABC, any participation by the SBS in commercial pay TV will be subject to conditions to protect SBS free to air services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of pay TV and the mandating of digital technology presents exciting opportunities for Australian industry. This legislation allows licence conditions to be imposed to ensure that licensees A and B put in place adequate Australian industry development arrangements. The details are to be worked out by the Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). As we settle these details an important focus will be on the employment opportunities provided by this new industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that industry development requirements should not be imposed in a heavy-handed way. However, minimum requirements will be that licensees A and B will need to select consumer reception equipment that is available for manufacture under licence in Australia. A specific licence condition banning advertisements until 1997 is at section 101 of the Bill. The ban on X-rated programs and restrictions on R material already incorporated in schedule 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 have been retained for all subscription television broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV needs costly and sophisticated central subscriber databases, control systems and technology to turn describe subscribers `on' and `off' and to bill them. All licensees are free to operate their own subscriber management systems but will be required by a licence condition set under the powers at section 100(3)(b) to provide access for other operators to their systems at a fair price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 116A allows use of additional satellite capacity so that pay TV coverage can reach areas where direct reception of the Optus high performance beams is impractical. This provision will allow satellite pay TV licensees to make use of other beams or technologies without requiring separate licences. The Bill recognises that satellite is the only technology that is readily accessible now to most Australians to receive pay TV services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As set out in section 132 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the sole means of delivering pay TV by satellite is through use of Optus satellites until 1 July 1997. After that date, other suitable satellite capacity could be used by pay TV operators. Providing this degree of protection during a time when further satellite capacity is likely to become available in our region and mandating the use of digital compression technology for the delivery of satellite pay TV offers significant commercial advantages to Optus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Optus `monopoly' extends only to the provision of its satellite based facility. The Government requires assurance from Optus that the use of compressed digital technology for pay TV will not require that the remote services using Optus satellites be converted to digital transmission, nor that there will be flow-on pricing increases for those remote service providers use of satellites. Section 115 and a licence condition at part 6 of schedule 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 prevent the siphoning from free to air television of events listed by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few points in conclusion. A regulatory regime for pay TV in Australia has been 15 years in the making. The Government has responded in a responsible way to what the Senate has asked for in its Committee report. The Government was asked to mandate one channel for the ABC&mdash;this legislation gives it two. We have given it funding and allowed it maximum flexibility within the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind honourable members that the original ABC Galaxy model involved the national broadcaster entering a consortium as a minority partner with no money, trading its programming for equity, and competing for a licence in the price based allocation process. It now has its programming, $12.5m of public money and two assured channels on the satellite. This is a rational and responsible proposal for the introduction of pay television into Australia. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted for debate to continue forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation commenced in the Senate earlier in the week. It has to come here, as the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) is in the other place, go through this House rapidly tonight, and then go back to the Senate. Hopefully it will be concluded tonight. Unfortunately this will be a truncated debate about the commencement of a new industry. That is what pay TV is. In part, that is why there has been so much debate over such a long period about the proposed structure of pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have watched this debate over the last 20-odd months&mdash;almost the same period as the gestation period for an elephant&mdash;I wonder whether we are finally going to see something emerge. Personally, I hope that we do because pay television has been denied to this country for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has occasioned a lot of self-denial from many people. Members on both sides of the chamber have worked long and hard so that we might finally see the pay television Bill passed tonight. I apologise to members of the Screen Producers Association for not attending their dinner tonight but, as this matter was coming on, I felt it was worth spending a little time preparing. This is one group that will benefit from pay TV, because it will provide yet another avenue for programs, particularly programs that are made in Australia, which is dear to members of that organisation, and which they have been discussing in Canberra tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it is probably worth while having a few moments to reflect on the procedures and policy decisions that have been followed in this debate.

<PARA>Unfortunately, I have to say that the very first matter that I wanted to raise in my second reading amendment, which has been circulated, condemns the Government for what had been a chaotic policy proposal. There was nothing chaotic about the entrance of my colleague, the Whip, to second this amendment. I thank him for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that it has to be said that this debate has gone on and on and on. There was a four-year Government imposed moratorium on pay TV that ended in September 1990. No decision was reached and the moratorium was extended for another year. That is despite clamouring for a long period of time that pay television ought to be available in this country. We saw a March 1991 rejection by Cabinet of a proposal by Minister Beazley motivated by the impending sale of Aussat and how to make it more attractive. Then, in October 1991, the Government announced that the moratorium would end on 1 October 1992. There was a great flurry of activity at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, an exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill was released which included the first of many models for pay TV. Its essential feature was one national licence protected by an exclusivity period until 1997. Indeed, that exclusivity period is a centrepiece of the proposal that is put forward here. There are cross-media limits of 25 per cent for individual commercial television companies, an aggregate limit set by the Minister, and foreign ownership limits, also set by the Minister. By March 1992 the whole matter was thrown into confusion by yet another communications Minister. I have to say that the Government has had a procession of them over there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously nobody wants my job. Senator Collins, I think, was about our fourth or fifth communications Minister. Senator Richardson came forward yet again with a new model which had individual cross-ownership limits and an aggregate limit on foreign investment. Yet another Minister was appointed in May 1992 and he again had to go into the learning curve about pay TV, although I have to say that the people involved in the Department have been there all the time and I continue to be amazed at their capacity to live through all these dramatic jumps and hurdles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was sitting in Perth watching the Channel 9 program one Sunday and I saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) appear and announce yet another pay TV model. I think that that particular announcement surprised about 98 per cent, maybe even 99 per cent of the Labor Party. So we started yet again. That was on 31 May, when we saw yet another model come forward. Then, by June, we saw another about-face, with the Prime Minister announcing mark II with a full transponder licence to be operated by new players. I am not going to go into a great deal of detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then, by 24 June, the Broadcasting Services Bill was introduced. It was during that period and that debate at some early hour of the morning in the Senate&mdash;and all the action in this debate seems to take place in the Senate&mdash;that we saw the Broadcasting Services Bill, which had included the satellite pay television proposals, excised and sent to a committee. It was interesting that one of the centrepieces of that debate on that occasion was whether or not the ABC ought to be involved in pay television. </PARA>

If one took the in principle decision to allow free to air television to migrate into a new industry and there was going to be, over time, a movement of audience from free to air to pay television, as there has been in other countries, it seemed to me to be the logical argument that that opportunity should be extended to public broadcasting.

I am not sure when it got to the Government but, in any event, some of the concerns it raised I think lack foundation. It was concerned about the Trade Practices Act but, in any event, I think its concerns lack foundation. It has been given an opportunity and I note that in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade the ABC is lauding the proposals that have been put forward by the Government for pay TV. All I say is that I welcome it. We are all going to be interested to see whether it will work. I do not believe&mdash;and I will have some remarks about Trade Practices a little later&mdash;that the ABC ought to fear the involvement of the Trade Practices Commission in this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we come to tonight, when we are now debating yet another and, I hope, the final proposal. I think that the Government stands condemned for the way that it has handled the policy processes. I think that any objective observer who has watched this debate&mdash;it is technical in its terms, but it also excites a great deal of interest from a lot of vested interests&mdash;has been confused from time to time about where the Government is actually going as it tries to grapple with this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's rhetoric is all about competition and allowing technology to flourish, yet the essence of this structure is that it has tried to curtail and limit technology. I have to say&mdash;and I have been saying this for a long time, and it probably bores people&mdash;that because I have been saying it for a long time and my Party has been saying it for a long time, some of the message has got through. This model includes some changes on the last model. The first and most significant change is that there has been the embracing of digital compressed video, in preference to analog technology. That is a bipartisan position now. That requires and gives the capacity to a whole new range of opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time we were debating analog technology, which was limiting, we got ourselves into great excitement about how to access transponders and who gets what, and so on. There is a much better approach taken on this occasion. But that is the first and most important thing. The other issue that has now picked up, of course, is the role for the ABC and possibly the SBS in being involved in providing some of their program expertise&mdash;Australian in flavour that it is&mdash;into a pay TV regime that will emerge over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC is to be embedded in the Act for the delivery of whatever method, although there is a limitation that it is not applicable to the involvement and the issuing of the A, B and C licences. The Opposition moved an amendment, which enjoyed some support in the other place, that picked up an involvement of the TPC. In my view, that is important. It is consistent with the second reading amendment which I have moved, the genus of which is that we believe that a much more competitive model is established in accordance with the principles and concerns set out in the amendment. I commend the amendment to anyone who might be contemplating entering into the pay TV regime, so that he is fully aware of what the coalition's view is about how the future should unfold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to come back to the TPC and the amendment that I have moved&mdash;it was agreed to in the Senate&mdash;the basis of the amendment is to give the TPC a total coverage across the Act. There is only that small area that is exempted within the Bill, which is hopefully soon to become an Act. I notice that the Minister for Transport and Communications in the other place was not overly excited about this proposal and I welcome his grudging acceptance of it, even though he felt that he had to speak against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want there to be recognition by the TPC of the realities of the marketplace. We want investment and expertise to be involved in pay TV to make it work. The key issue is the definition of `market' in the assessment of any pay TV arrangements and consortia. Our desire in moving that amendment relating to the first licences is to maximise the benefits to consumers and also to ensure that the industry does have an opportunity to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the TPC is cognisant of and sensitive to the sentiments that are expressed in the amendment that we have moved. We would not, of course, expect that the TPC's involvement would in any way curtail the emergence of a pay TV regime. We just believe that the competitive emergence of a pay TV regime is a central issue. It is an issue of principle and it ought to be one that is consistent throughout the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters that are worth mentioning. This time there is no exclusivity in technology of delivery; there is no exclusivity for a single licensee in the provision of satellite delivery; there is common customer reception equipment for satellite pay TV, which is an issue that I think is extremely important; there are codes of practice relating to billing and fault repair, privacy and credit management for satellite pay TV; there is a contents standard amendment relating to R-rated material on satellite pay TV&mdash;and I will have a little to say about violence shortly; and also there is an attempt in proposed section 116 to ensure that as much of Australia as possible is covered by satellite pay TV, even though that amendment only extends to not requiring additional licence issues. But that is a matter that is probably going to cause some difficulties and some future concern, and it may be an area that we will have to focus on as the industry develops. Senator Harradine moved in the Senate an amendment to introduce a clause on standards for satellite pay TV relating to the protection of children, and those issues are picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those issues have come forward into the regime that we are now debating. They were a product of the arguments put forward from this side of the House, and they have been broadly accepted by the Government. So even though this has been a long, chaotic experience, it has certainly been an experience that has enjoyed broad industry support. It is a structure that, although fundamentally flawed, is a little closer to what we believe ought to be the final outcome. It is for that reason that the coalition will allow this legislation to pass. I know that is cause for a great sigh of relief from the Labor Party Caucus&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very generous gesture, given that the structure is fatally flawed. But it is also important, after so many years, that at least there is a piece of legislation upon which the industry can fixate and from which we can have some stepping forward to the possibility of the emergence of a pay TV industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted also to make some more points and I was going to talk at length about DCV, but I will not. Digital compression video also means that channels are redundant. It now has  the capacity to provide program services that we are talking about. But the flaw in the Government's proposal is that the model artificially limits this capacity to 10 channels. DCV technology dramatically expands the capacity way beyond the 10 channels which have been split between licences A, B and C. There are reasons for that, which I can understand, but in principle it is fundamentally wrong. In combination with that, we have a limit to 1997. I have my own private theories as to why 1997 is the date, which probably do not bear to be expanded here. I do not think it is a rational reason; but it seems to be a date that keeps appearing in the broadcasting legislation. As I have signalled before, it is a date that we do not agree with and it is a date that we will visit, in terms of review and otherwise, at an early time. We will also be looking at the issues to which it relates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are alternative delivery mechanisms available. There are MDS&mdash;microwave&mdash;cable and offshore satellites. The exclusivity of the Optus satellite is challenged by these alternative deliveries. The immediate services are microwave, and they are ready to go now. I expect that there will be some movement in that area straight away. There are no foreign restrictions, and neither there should be, on holding an MDS licence. I hope that they will commence straight away. They will be more localised and regionalised pay TV services. AOTC-Telecom is also examining alternatives for the delivery of pay TV in the period before optical fibre becomes universal. According to AOTC, these technologies are in much the same time scale as DCV by satellite. DCV, or the satellite services that we are talking about, will not start for 12 to 18 months anyway, and if we have these alternative technologies available, they may well be coming on stream at the same time as the satellite systems&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not hold my breath, but my fundamental point is that as there are emerging alternative technologies, it lends credence to my point: why restrict our preferences to the use of one technology? That is the issue that I have raised in the in-principle amendment. The hybrid optical fibre co-ax proposal is a mature technology which can be commenced in the short term but requires significant investment. It is probably that, more than the technology, that might delay it; but in combination with MDS, perhaps, other opportunities might emerge. There is digitally compressed video to flow over copper, which is a new but proven technology, and that also might be a possibility. Again the main question will be cost. Indeed, trials are about to commence in Centennial Park and Wollongong to try out these alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are other issues and alternatives, too, and they include the offshore satellite services. AsiaSat 2, Pan Am Sat and Intelsat will come into Australia in 1993. Satellite services emanating outside Australia are not limited by the Bill. This is a major victory and concession to us, as we have strongly pushed for no limitations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in other words, services which are competitive with the exclusive until 1997 Optus DCV satellite will be a reality prior to or at the time of the commencement of what is provided for in this Bill. The Government's model is, in a sense, an unlevel playing field, and some are concerned that licence A might be a virtual dead duck. It is the licence for new media players with a 35 per cent foreign aggregate restriction. As I point out, we are not prescriptive about the level of foreign investment in this industry or, indeed, others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the Trade Practices Commission. The Bill breaks new ground in the coalition's agenda by requiring in proposed sections 96 and 97 that the TPC overview licence allocations beyond 1997. I think that is a sensible proposal. As I have said, we moved an amendment, which was accepted, which tries to build on that in relation to the A and B activity, that is, the initial licences. The opportunity for niche services versus free to air is an issue that I think I have related already. We have to recognise that in time the networks will shed significant market share, as they are already a mature industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will not be long. In any event, pay TV is an industry that sees the beginning of a proliferation of niche services, which will include information data and interactive services, in addition to pure entertainment. The program menu for the consumer will be far more extensive, and the consumer will choose rather than have it chosen, as is now the case. The networks are thus keen to protect their investment and seek to have a significant role in order to spread the investment and capture the migrating market. The Parliament is giving them the opportunity to be involved in this new industry. I think, in principle, that is a correct decision. So our goal, of course, is to ensure that new players can in fact play, and that there are not barriers to entry that are such that only current networks can play, which effectively exclude others. That is one of the issues that I am relating to in the second reading amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is pressure on time, and I understand that many of my colleagues who wanted to speak will not be able to speak for very long. That is why, as the principal respondent&mdash;if that is the right way to describe my position on behalf of the Opposition&mdash;I have taken a little bit more time. I also want to refer briefly to the amendment that has been circulated by the Government. It relates to codes and it is, in part, the response to the legitimate concern that all of us have about violence on television and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill was amended in the Senate by Senator Harradine, but the Government is seeking to amend that amendment also. As I understand the Government's amendment, it seeks to put in the positive any action by the Parliament to review the voluntary codes proposed by the industry to the Parliament. It is my view, on reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of yesterday, that that is a reasonably sensible amendment. I sought some legal advice about that from within the Parliament today and, cursory though it is, I think it would be appropriate that I seek the leave of the to table it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advice is from the Legislative Research Service, and is an overview of the central issue that I believe the Senator Harradine amendment raises.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it will not be a situation where only one House of the Parliament decides the issue.</PARA>
<PARA>My understanding of his amendment is that it can have the impact of allowing one House to respond to concerns about a code while not requiring the other House to take a positive step in support of those concerns. Broadly committed as we are to a sense of voluntary codes, we would not want to allow for a mechanism that, in a sense, would defeat them. There has been some debate about whether or not that is the interpretation that should be put on the Senator Harradine amendment. At this time I take the view, based on my advice, that the Government's amendment has some legitimacy, so we will not be dividing on it on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other issues that I want to raise, and I know that many of my colleagues who have followed this debate at a distance also want to raise some matters. I come back to my fundamental point that this industry needs to be allowed to have an open-architecture approach to technology. It needs to be competitive in all its aspects, but it also needs to be able to start. There are long-run investments required and it is a risky business; there is no doubt about that. It will be difficult in the current economic climate for this industry to start, but significant benefits will flow from it and we recognise those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have consistently argued the case for pay television for many years. In the past we have introduced private members' Bills in an effort to establish pay television in this country. When people look back at this debate, they will see that it involves a reasonably momentous decision. I do not know whether we will finally get this Bill through. If we do, it will be a start. It is not as constructive as we would want it to be, but I believe we are taking a genuine and constructive approach in allowing this legislation to pass. We have argued consistently that it needs to be better than it is. Previously we have successfully held it up to make the Government focus on many more issues. Some of them have been picked up, but not all of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill. I am mindful of the number of Government members who chose to speak on this Bill and who, because of the time frame, have been cut short. It is a very important piece of legislation because it will carry Australia into the next century, with the enormous complexities and various technologies that go hand in hand with pay television. With this legislation comes the continuation of the amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which will lead to increased competition in telecommunications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill allows for the licensing and regulatory administration for the provision of subscription television broadcasting services&mdash;pay TV, as we like to call it&mdash;which can now be delivered using any technology: cable, microwave or satellite. The legislation also contains regulations pertaining to the licensing of individual pay TV services, as well as putting in place a specific regime for pay TV services delivered by satellite. Concerns about the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's involvement have been addressed, and measures to provide consumer protection in regard to pay TV are introduced with this Bill. One of the most important aspects of this legislation is that the ban on X-rated programs and the restriction on R-rated material which is already incorporated in schedule 2 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 have been retained for all pay television broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent community concern over violence on television following the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the amount of unnecessary and potentially damaging violence shown on television today proves that restrictions on our programming are necessary and warranted. Whether we like it or not, people equate violence on television with violent public behaviour. Mothers organisations and community and church groups have all come out in support of our Prime Minister's suggestion to restrict violence on television by airing certain programs later at night so that children are less able to be influenced by and subjected to them. The issue will recur again and again following the commencement of pay television. The Parliament should be fully aware of the number of people in our electorates who feel strongly about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of television violence on children is an overriding community concern. Young children are less able to distinguish fantasy from reality and generally have undeveloped media literacy skills. Parents must therefore fulfil their important role as guides for their children's television viewing. However, parents need assistance in providing this guidance for their children. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal believes that this help should be given to parents through media education programs and the adoption by the industry of clear and appropriate program scheduling and classification practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is confusion in the community between the classification system for television and those for cinema films and videos. There will also need to be a classification system for programs shown on pay TV. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal said in its 1990 report to the Parliament that adoption of a similar standard of classification for cinema, video and television could encourage more permissive programming on TV. This in turn could create too great a tolerance of aggression. The ABT therefore did not support a common system of classification at that time. However, within the framework of the current classification system, adults have the right to make their own decisions about what they view on television, provided that children are protected from unsuitable and possibly harmful material. Therefore, a uniform industry-wide code should be adopted. Our Prime Minister's recent request for the industry to move in this direction is certainly a step towards achieving this code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian society has become increasingly concerned about the level of violence on TV as the level of violence in real life has itself appeared to increase. The number of horrifying massacres occurring in our suburbs has contributed to a growing belief that Australian society contains unexpected elements of extreme violence. The attention devoted by all forms of the media to violence and violent crime has added to a widespread feeling that violence is a major problem in Australian society. Coupled with this feeling is the assumption that in some way there is a connection between violent behaviour and the violence portrayed and presented in the media, particularly on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the responsibility for what is shown on television now relies on television broadcasters, the Government and consumers, with the advent of pay television restrictions on violent programs will be difficult. Therefore, it is up to the Parliament to consider and investigate every avenue available in an effort to protect children from potentially harmful material on pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also up to the industry to take into consideration community concerns and respect these concerns when organising its programs. If the television networks have a legitimate interest in pay television, they should prove now that they are prepared to reflect community attitudes through their free to air programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that our Government has taken the issue of violence on television in hand. I am particularly happy that the newly created Australian Broadcasting Authority will soon commence Australia-wide research into community attitudes towards levels of violence and depictions of sex to allow it to devise appropriate classifications for pay television. I am also pleased that our Prime Minister has succeeded in his negotiations with the television industry in coming up with a proposal regarding programming classification which should be supported by this Parliament. According to the proposal, the M and the MA categories, which will replace the AO which is currently used for television, are an excellent idea. The timeslot for M category films will be 8.30 p.m., while the MA programs will be aired at 9 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Broadcasting Authority will monitor the utilisation of the new classification system and ensure that television stations suitably modify material for broadcast within the appropriate codes under the self-regulatory framework. This new system will mean that for the first time AO-type films will be more appropriately classified and the 8.30 timeslot will see softer material telecast than is presently aired under the current system of classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The networks have also agreed, I am pleased to say, to the Prime Minister's request that the sexual, violent and bad language content of movies is described so consumers can make an informed decision about what they are going to watch. The average American child sees 8,000 murders and 100,000 other acts of violence on television by the time he or she leaves primary school. We do not want a situation like that occurring in Australia. Our Prime Minister's proposal is a step towards the prevention of these sorts of statistics becoming the norm in our country. A review of the classification system is long overdue, and I am sure the Prime Minister's proposal will receive general support from the industry and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation before the House and trust that the classification system adopted in regard to pay television will take into consideration the current debate over violence on TV and the proposal put forward by the Prime Minister, which will ensure the protection of our children from harmful and overly violent programming. </PARA>

<PARA>The Government opposed the amendment to section 128 of the Broadcasting Services Act in the Senate and still opposes it. It is of grave concern to the Government that under the amendment a program standard or code of practice could be amended without being formally considered by either House. The Senate's amendment fundamentally compromises the arm's length position of broadcasting from politics and the independence of the regulator; that is, the Australian Broadcasting Authority. It takes the powers over standards away from the community through public consultation and the ABA and weakens the new body we have just established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an underlying principle of the Broadcasting Services Act that the regulation of broadcasting be carried out by the ABA, the expert body, on Parliament's behalf with parliamentary oversight in certain areas, such as program standards. The amendment makes a mockery of the concept of supervised, guided industry self-regulation and allows industry to wriggle out of its responsibilities to take full account of community attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notices introduced under the amendment could potentially have serious financial implication for broadcasters and, without the guaranteed scrutiny by at least one House, could lead to the market reassessing the risks associated with investment in the broadcasting industry. The amendment also overrides the power of the independent regulator and could be viewed by some as the Parliament indicating that the regulator's decision should be subject to change by Parliament without even Parliament needing to consider the changes. It hardly demonstrates that the Parliament has confidence in the regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the Opposition is to persist with this, the Government will not let it be a basis to reject the pay TV legislation. Unfortunately, Senator Harradine's draft got it wrong. In the interests of good law, we therefore move our amendment to fix it up. However, recognising the intention of the Opposition and the Democrats, the Government's amendment No. 1 ensures that at least one House votes on the motion to amend. Amendment No. 2 provides a 28-day period for the industry to make the necessary changes to comply with the amendment, otherwise broadcasters would be required instantly to conform with the changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to reiterate some of the remarks that I made earlier. The issue here is as I outlined. But I have to say that I disagree with the section in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Martin) where he talks about the amendment making a `mockery of the concept of supervised, guided industry self-regulation'. I think the intent was not to undermine that broad issue; the intent was to give the Parliament a role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the amendment addresses the effectiveness of that role, such as that it will not give to one House in preference to another an opportunity to make a decision about an action it might propose to take and exclude the opportunity for the other House to so act. Generally speaking, the Houses should be required to take a positive action with regard to any action that is proposed. It ought not to be, therefore, something occasioned to change without one of the Houses actually taking a positive step; in other words, if one of the Houses takes no action, the proposal from the other House becomes the decision of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are extremely important to many members and, indeed, to the industry. I think it is important that we try to get it right and that we do not establish a precedent in the legislation. I understand that if this amendment had gone through in the form proposed it would be somewhat unusual and deny the opportunity of the Parliament in both Houses to act in a concerted, positive way to address a concern that it might have about a legitimate issue relating to voluntary codes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a statement to the Parliament on 15 September 1992, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) outlined the Government's reform strategy for spectrum management. That statement followed the Government's acceptance of the 1991 report on spectrum management by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Radiocommunications Bill 1992 and related legislation gives effect to those changes. The new Bill will replace the existing Radiocommunications Act 1983. As well as including the reform measures outlined in the Minister's earlier statement, the Bill incorporates provisions from existing legislation which are not being substantially changed, although the opportunity has been taken to modernise the drafting of the legislation. While the Bill is fairly technical in nature, it represents a significant reform measure which complements and extends the Government's reforms in telecommunications and broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to go into a detailed description of all the features of the Bill. Instead I would like to concentrate on some of the more significant and innovative changes being introduced. Members wishing further detail should consult the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill and the Minister's second reading speech made to the Senate on 12 November 1992. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Market-based Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most innovative change being introduced in the Bill is the introduction of a market-based system of spectrum management in selected areas of the spectrum. It was perhaps the key recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report and is a major feature of the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new market-based system of licensing contained in part 3.2 of the Bill represents a radical departure from the traditional approach of licensing the operation of specified devices. The cornerstone of the new system will be a new type of licence, to be called a `spectrum licence', which will provide explicit and continuing rights to spectrum access in defined parts of the spectrum in defined geographic areas. These licences will be freely tradeable and will be able to be split or amalgamated to suit the needs of users. Spectrum licences will be issued for fixed periods of up to 10 years, which will provide a more secure term for users. Introduction of the market-based approach will occur selectively and progressively, under the control of the Minister. Other spectrum will remain under the current administrative system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the Minister has designated a part of the spectrum for conversion to the market-based system, part 2.2 of the Bill provides for two processes as to how spectrum licences are to be issued. Firstly, conversion plans will be developed by the new Spectrum Management Agency (SMA) being established by the Bill, to convert existing apparatus licences to spectrum licences. Secondly, marketing plans will be developed for the sale of spectrum licences for unencumbered spectrum by auction, tender or for a pre-determined or negotiated price. In line with the recommendations of the Committee report, spectrum access rights will not be perpetual. The market-based system will not apply to broadcasting services bands used for AM-FM radio and VHF-UHF television. These bands will continue to be planned by the Australian Broadcasting Authority under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee identified two areas of potential concern with a market-based system&mdash;interference and access by non-commercial users. Special attention has been given to these issues. The SMA will be able to designate frequency bands for exclusive use by public or community services anywhere in the spectrum. Special provisions are also included to ensure public or community services have access to spectrum within the market system. To ensure that spectrum can be resumed when this would be in the public interest, the Bill allows the SMA to purchase spectrum licences in the open market or to compulsorily acquire spectrum licences subject to payment of just compensation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Administrative and Other Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to some of the other changes being introduced in this Bill. The Bill provides for an updated, more flexible scheme for determining technical standards and other forms of technical regulation. It provides for the making of agreements with Standards Australia for the drafting of standards and technical licence specifications, for recognition of overseas standards without the need for additional type testing of equipment and for devolution of compliance testing of equipment to recognised laboratories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SMA will in future issue apparatus licences. The Government recognises that changes are also required in this area. The current system of approximately 130 licence categories, with a wide disparity in the level of fees paid, needs to be made simpler, more rational and more equitable. One of the first tasks of the new SMA will be to undertake a review of the existing administrative licensing and pricing system, following an opportunity for public input. Until a new scheme is in place these fees will continue to be levied under the tax Acts, but the level of the fee will in future be determined by the SMA through the use of disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other changes will allow the SMA to determine classes of apparatus licences, thereby streamlining the licensing process; will increase the maximum period of such licences to five years; will introduce an explicit renewal procedure into the legislation; and will allow class licensing of low-powered devices and services. Further changes will allow the SMA to make arrangements with banks and post offices for the collection of licence fees and charges. This should be of particular benefit to users in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Spectrum Management Agency</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the reforms contained in this Bill will depend on having an efficient and effective organisation to implement them. The SMA is to be established as a separate statutory agency within the transport and communications portfolio and will have a structure similar to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian Customs Service and similar bodies. Like those agencies it will operate within the legal umbrella of the Commonwealth. It will not be a statutory authority with its own body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would add that the measures included in this Bill provide for the most comprehensive reform of spectrum management ever undertaken in Australia. They will provide Australia with a system of spectrum management appropriate for a modern communications based economy, one better able to respond to a rapidly changing international communications environment. I present the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the Bill and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Radiocommunications Bill is the principal Bill in a package of legislation. But, due to mechanisms that operate between the two Houses, to a large extent debate has already taken place on the additional Bills that go with this package; namely, a range of taxation Bills. Taxation Bills have to be initiated in the lower House, so they were dealt with here the other day. On that occasion I spoke at some length and I used some detailed graphs to illustrate what this debate was all about. I shall not be doing that tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the record to relate the coalition's view on this piece of legislation. I accept the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) that this is a major change, and indeed it is. But it has its genesis in a report by the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics of some time ago which discussed how we ought to deal with the issue of spectrum. It was felt in that report that a more open market-based regime that enabled a more efficient allocation by allowing market pressures to determine access to available spectrum ought to be in operation. It viewed the prospect, in essence, somewhat like a land titles issue, that people ought to be able to trade in spectrum space, that different uses could be made of certain areas of the spectrum from time to time, and that once someone had the use of a spectrum space it ought not automatically always stay as that particular use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, as more competing technologies and services emerge, they ought to be given the opportunity to access the spectrum because it is finite in its application; it is a renewable resource and there is limited space. For example, television takes up a very large space on the spectrum, so other competing services such as mobile phones are not able necessarily to get the spectrum space they need. Therefore, we have to move people off the spectrum space to enable those new services to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of getting people off is a long and lengthy one. Generally speaking, in this country we have an equipment-type approach&mdash;we wait until the relevant equipment runs down and it is not such an economic burden when people are asked to move it off. This spectrum has been managed by governments for a long period. The proposal is trying to convert certain areas of the spectrum to a market-based approach in order to allow the spectrum to have more open access in a bidding-type process. In that sense, we welcome it, but I do have reservations. I expressed some of those the other day. I tabled a brief paper to accompany some of my remarks because I take the view that this is but a small first step that responds in part to the BTCE report and the subsequent report by HORSCOTCI&mdash;a House of Representatives committee&mdash;of which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), the former Minister, was Chairman. I note that he is in the House, and I assume he will speak. My colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) was also a member of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of that Committee did not go as far as the BTCE report. It felt that a more measured approach was required. Those recommendations are reflected in this legislation. It was a bipartisan report, and we are also offering our support for this Bill, but with reservations. The reservations primarily concern whether or not the structures both in place under the Telecommunications Act and the Broadcasting Services Act, and as proposed under this Bill, are such as to provide for emerging technologies and services. It should be remembered that this proposal, which establishes the Spectrum Management Authority, will not have an all-encompassing role in determining all spectrum because the Broadcasting Services Act provides that the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the successor in title and function to the old ABT, will now have a broadcasting planning role; that is, it will be determining the allocation of FM spectrum space, AM spectrum space, television spectrum space and indeed space on the spectrum for satellite services which we talked about recently in terms of pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a split function between the allocation of spectrum. In the medium to longer term, I wonder whether or not this is the best way to deal with it. I think those issues are a long way off. I do not, by my remarks, indicate that there is any proposal to change dramatically what is being put forward here, although there are some reservations that many would hold. We have to remember that the Parliament has taken the view that it has reserved areas of spectrum for television and it creates a barrier to other operators because the licence that is given to television operators is exclusive to their use. In time, as we see a change in delivery of services, particularly in the data, information and entertainment modes, there will be probably other competing users for the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of this whole area is that we are getting an interesting move in that those who are existing users of wire-like technology&mdash;that is, telecommunications companies that run messages on wires into people's homes&mdash;are increasingly starting to use the airwaves or spectrum space to provide services, such as mobile phones. What we are seeing on the broadcasting side is that broadcasting and entertainment services are increasingly going to use optic fibre to go into the home; in other words, wire will take services into the home and therefore it will give people greater choice. It is interactive, which means that a message can be sent in and I can send a message out; I can do my home shopping and home banking, and so on. But as those technologies emerge&mdash;and the Saunderson committee some years ago made the observation that the optimal way of delivering entertainment to the home was by optic fibre; it is just expense and the state of that technology that is limiting it at the present time&mdash;it is interesting to see the change that is taking place. I think most of the work in this area recognises that dramatic change is taking place in all of these areas. It is how we respond to that that is going to be extremely important in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some responses to the legislation from various interest groups. The response is not universal in welcoming the Act, but I take the view that it is a small step in the right direction. It identifies clearly in an Act a better way of managing the spectrum. It is easier and more understandable. It is an area that is not visited regularly, but it has a profound impact on the delivery of so many services. I would argue&mdash;along, I am sure, with the Minister&mdash;that it will have an increasing impact. Therefore, we must start to focus on how we are going to deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this regime that is being proposed with the Spectrum Management Agency and its new licensing regime&mdash;under the existing licensing regime there are some 90 different transmission-type licences that people can apply for&mdash;we do not want to see developing a stronger regulatory regime to ensure a better financial return to government. This new market-based licensing system ought not be seen as a fund-raising proposal. What has to be the centrepiece&mdash;it was the centrepiece of the recommendation of the HORSCOTCI report&mdash;is to have better and more efficient utilisation of the spectrum space. That is what has to drive this reform. It ought not be seen as just a fund-raising exercise. I hope, as we get into more detail and see how the Bill is actually implemented, that we do not get diverted by that. I would point out that the SMA does not start until, I think, 1 July 1993, so the capacity for any Minister in the future to review aspects of this model will be open. All the major areas of concern for users are effectively external to the Act. The SMA, which in some ways is like Austel, requires ministerial direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said the other day that there are disallowance instruments throughout the legislation. I think that such instruments ought to be in legislation, particularly legislation of a technical type, so that the Parliament does not become totally divorced from the process of overviewing the legislation that it puts in place. It probably would be rare that the Parliament would respond to documents that are lodged in terms of their disallowance, but I think it is increasingly going to be important and, as I said the other night, the legislative processes and forms which we pursue in this chamber are important. Too few take a detailed role in it, and the committee procedures of this chamber have fallen off in the short period that I have been here. Detailed committee consideration of clauses of Bills is denied, and I think that is a shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will, increasingly, be disallowable instruments that ought to enjoy the scrutiny of the Parliament. Indeed, to the credit of the Clerks on this side of the Parliament, they now issue a list of documents that have a disallowable function attached to them for members who want to scrutinise more closely the activity of the Executive and the regulatory authorities which are created by Acts such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of comments that could be made about the clauses. Radio emission covers everything from the sun to pocket flashlights. We want to make sure that the definition that reflects the objects of clause 3 is more appropriate, that is, that it relates to management of what needs managing rather than creating a power base to take over areas that do not require management. That might be a little unfair, but what we are trying to say is that we do not want areas that do not actually require management to be picked up by the SMA and the new regime in a management sense. This is not to be a proposal that requires even more regulatory overview. On the contrary, it should require less. That is the very essence of a market based scheme that is proposed. It will be up to the Minister to determine the area of the spectrum that will be subject to the market scheme. That being the case, I signal that, if I were the Minister, I would want to accelerate that process of identifying areas that ought to be subject to the market system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there will be limitations and one of those limitations is the physical properties of the spectrum itself. One would have to take account of that. There is no compulsion on the SMA to consult and no remedial action for errors. The penalties are not in line with the value of either the equipment or services that may transgress the Act. For example, there is a penalty of $150,000 for the use of an electric garage door opener that is not approved. A sliding scale is needed. That penalty would seem to be inappropriate, but some of those areas could be dealt with a little later and perhaps, in this place or in another place, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) or his Department could give me a little more information about those types of issues. I do not have an electric garage door opener&mdash;and my understanding is that that is probably a poor example because I do not think it would be subject to the Act&mdash;but a fine of $150,000 in such a case would be ludicrous. It does not seem that that would be the case, and the advisers in the box may be able to clear that matter up. I do not think that that would be the intent of the legislation, but I just make the point about draconian penalties for usage. Some may be justified, of course, but others may not for the level of the infringement. I just point out that we would not wish to have a penalty regime based on the revenue that it might generate but which is not in proportion to the offence that might be committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of other things could be said, but I think that is probably sufficient at this stage, given that dinner awaits some of us. The points that I have made are encapsulated in the view that I stated at the commencement of my speech, that we believe that this legislation should pass. We believe that the Radiocommunications Consultative Council is an example of the consultative process that ought to be adopted, and I will certainly watch that with interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the disallowable instruments proposal, but I do wonder and have concerns about whether or not the totality of this Act and the way it is put together, in conjunction with the Broadcasting Services Act and the Telecommunications Act, in fact goes far enough. I suspect that in time this issue will need to be revisited. It has been a bit like the Broadcasting Services Act earlier in the year. We saw a total rewrite of that Act for the first time in 50 years, to try to reflect the dramatic changes that are taking place in broadcasting. This Bill tries to reflect the dramatic changes that have to take place in spectrum management. It is a start, a beginning. It gives us a focus on the issue. The Parliament has had an active involvement in its preparation but, like so much legislation, it can always be better and it should always enjoy the detailed scrutiny of the Parliament. It has not necessarily enjoyed it here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a complex area and the number of speakers on the speakers list reflects the fact that it is not something that honourable members take a lot of time to pursue. But it is something that each and every one of us knows touches all of our homes and our lives, so in that sense it is a very important piece of legislation. It is unique. It does not go as far as the New Zealand model and it is not as detailed as the New Zealand legislation, but it is a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to hearing the remarks of the honourable member for Shortland, who was Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure which was the genesis of the recommendations that are reflected in this Bill. As I have said, the coalition will allow this Bill to pass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member means that the coalition would abolish the other place, that is a good idea. I do not share the views of the honourable member for Bass in terms of this being a small step. It is not a small step; it is a major step. If we look back to the original Act&mdash;almost to the time of Federation; shortly after Federation&mdash;from the outset it was always said that the spectrum had a finite capacity. But, on every occasion on which it was stressed that it had a finite capacity and that we could not make greater use of it, technology came to the rescue. It has been like a piece of elastic. Even though it had a finite length, we have been able to stretch it further and further as technology has enabled us to make much better use of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contradiction I find in the words of my colleague opposite is in respect of using the introduction of a mixed market and administrative system, and the marketing aspects being used simply as a fund raising exercise. This seems to me to be in contradiction with what the Opposition is saying, because it wants to move to a free market in almost every other area. This is a very important step forward to introduce a market component in how we manage the spectrum. There is no other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With my colleagues the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman), who both played a very important part in the preparation of our report, we came very much to the conclusion quickly that there is no way in which a group of bureaucrats sitting in an office somewhere in Canberra can divine the value of a piece of spectrum. There is only one way to establish that value and that is through the market process. It is not possible, given the complexity of use of the total spectrum, to move rapidly into that, so we took what we believe was a very important step in making the recommendation that is being adopted in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also express, on behalf of the Committee, our appreciation of the very strong support given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) at the time the report was processed, even though it is almost a year afterwards. We are very happy with the response from Government and are very pleased with the collaborative effort of both Opposition and Government members in bringing this report forward. Communications are an essential element of micro-economic reform, and modern industrial countries depend very much on good communications. All forms of communication either do or can use a radio frequency spectrum in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to office in 1983 we suffered from an antiquated radio spectrum management legislation which went back almost to 1905. We set about updating and modernising that legislation through the Radiocommunications Act 1983, but there have been rapid changes in the nine years since. Whilst the 1983 Act introduced many improvements, it did not change the manner in which the frequencies were assigned or the way in which services and licences were regulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the thrust of the Radiocommunications Bill has been to convert an inflexible, administratively based system of spectrum management to one where, for commercial users, spectrum access has become a tradable commodity. It also provides protection for non-commercial users of the frequency spectrum, and it recognises that the Government cannot abdicate its role in protecting the radio frequency spectrum, nor its international obligations and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Bass said, it is a very technical area, and there are rapid changes taking place in communications technology and innovations in service provision. But the Bill, and its predecessors earlier this week, will enable Australia to position itself for rapid technological change. We can be in a position to reap the benefits associated with the communications revolution. It is forward-looking legislation. Sure, it will obviously have to be adapted in time in light of experience, but the most important step to take is the step being taken in this Bill. That is why I am pleased to see the support of the Opposition for the legislation, even with its qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is rapid growth in demand, we can take full advantage of the opportunities as they arise. But if the growth does not occur we have not lost anything; so we have the best of both worlds. The existing system would not be able to cope with demand as it arose, so the value of the spectrum lies in its actual and potential exploitation for a range of public, private and commercial information purposes. The developments in radiocommunications technology, the advances in optical fibre and the use of computers in intelligent networks are all breaking down the old barriers and expanding the means of delivering all manner of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the simplest descriptions of the process of change put to us in the course of the inquiry was from Mr Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's media laboratory. I have said this in the House before, but I repeat it because it is so succinct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What currently goes through wires, chiefly voice, will move to the air; what currently goes through the air, chiefly video, will move to wires. The phone will become wireless, as mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet; computer video will run over fibre optic cables in switched digital systems as convenient as the telephone is today.</PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that Australia be in the position of ensuring that advantage can be taken of the potential benefits offered in maximising the use of the airwaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the Committee to a large extent have been adopted by the Government in a package of legislation that concludes with tonight's Bill. But the problem overall is that the process involving the acquisition of new equipment by users renders existing equipment obsolete. The only way of achieving access to that new equipment is to allow users time or tenure in which to gradually change over to new spectrum frequencies and to have certainty of occupancy of that spectrum. As I said earlier, there is a value attaching to occupancy of certain segments of the spectrum, and the only way to determine that is through the process of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation it is not a case of the Government providing a response to the BTCE report. The BTCE report was one of the pieces of information that was examined by the Committee in the course of its inquiry. A great deal of work was done by officers of the Department of Transport and Communications. Again in this debate I would like to express my appreciation and that of my Committee colleagues to Mr David Hartley and Ms Gwen Andrews. Over and over again they responded to the many requests that we made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it is quite a technical area. To get answers and an understanding of what the spectrum is about and how it functions and the uses that can be made of it, we had to continually go back to people in the Department to draw upon the information, skills and knowledge available there. Both those officers gave us a great deal of help. Also, Colin Knowles at times was very helpful. The Department's assistance was invaluable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, and its virtual adoption by Government, is an excellent example to everyone outside this place of how committees of the Parliament can achieve progress and solve problems. This problem was never going to be solved by the Department alone or by a Minister alone. I believe this is a classic example of what bipartisanship in the Parliament can achieve and of what committees of the Parliament can achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills will enable Australia to position itself for rapid technological change. Australia will be in a position to reap the benefits associated with the communications revolution. The Bills are forward looking. I would anticipate, in response again to the honourable member for Bass, that the problem will be, five years down the track, that a future Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee of this House will review progress that has been made with the new legislation and with the new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that an appropriate course to follow, as the changes in the legislation we are putting through this week need to be considered, will be for the Committee to carry out that review. It should again take in public input, and examine that in an impartial forum where the facts can be tested in a manner in which they cannot be tested in the House. I look forward to that happening some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the sale of the spectrum will generate revenues that will enable the Department and the agency to move forward with people who want to move from other parts of the spectrum. There will be resources available. Currently we have people who have few resources, particularly in the non-commercial sector, who would like to move but cannot afford to. The ultimate result will enable people to get value from the piece of spectrum they occupy, if they want to&mdash;it will be their decision&mdash;and to provide funds to help other people to move. The purpose of the whole exercise has to be how to achieve the most efficient use of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that, almost from the outset&mdash;from the first radios and the first Act&mdash;it was said that the spectrum is finite. It is finite. But the technology development is ongoing. We will be able to put more and more onto the same given segment of spectrum. That is the case now as we look at digital compression in television and at the reversals that are going on. As I said earlier, what goes by air now will go by wire, and what goes by wire will go by air. I strongly support the legislation. I thank my colleagues who shared with me the task of reviewing what was happening with the spectrum. The preparation of this report was quite detailed work, and difficult, but we are very proud of the result. We are very pleased to see that it has the support of both sides of the House. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Department of Transport and Communications on the move towards a Bill and an explanatory memorandum which are in plain English. When a person in the marketplace uses the legislation, it will be very readily understood. I commend the Department for the flow chart of a mechanism by which a section of the Act will apply. We ought to be doing this with more of our legislation. It is a very commendable step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comes back to the work of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The Committee takes large pieces of information from the community at large and makes them bite-sized so that we can end up with legislation. This is a perfect example of the House at work. There is a committee of the House; the committee looks at the detail, and the legislation that comes up embodies the work of the committee so that we end up with something that reflects the community's position. As the honourable member for Shortland said, it is very readily understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pleasure to pick up this Bill and look at it, because we can make sense of it. We ought to strive for that in this Parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to say to the community at large that this Parliament does that very well&mdash;better than any other parliament in Australia. There is the committee work&mdash;looking at a distinctive body of knowledge, opinion and problems&mdash;and then there is the legislative process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just a question of members of parliament being fed by a remote bureaucracy. That is not the case here. As the honourable member for Shortland said, we have legislation which embodies these things. For people like me and the Clerks who take an interest in the function of Parliament, this is the legislative process at its best. I want to put that on the record. If we can work towards this goal in areas such as tax law we will be achieving a great deal. We should give credit where it is due. I cannot claim much credit in this instance, but I acknowledge what has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk particularly about the spectrum matter which was referred to. This concerns a radio station in Western Australia which will be seeking a special narrow cast licence. Currently this radio station has the burden of carrying racing programs and talk-back programs and there clearly is a conflict. Under this process a special narrow cast licence will allow a much better outcome without the need for a full hearing process. I am hopeful that radio station 6PR will end up with the 882 spot on the AM band and with 1206 AM under the special narrow cast licence. I do not want to presume what the ABA will do about this matter, but I am putting forward my views: I think that would be a very good outcome. We would get proper coverage of current affairs; news; racing, which is important for revenue; sport and other matters. </PARA>

When we talk about electronic communication, it is very rewarding that because of the nature of the medium very often what is said is what is conveyed to the listener or viewer. I want to contrast this with what can happen in newspapers where there can be contrived inaccuracy in communication. We have had some debate in this place in relation to broadcasting and the right of commercial television stations to put on air violent material at certain times of the day. A very productive debate has been going on about the broadcasting policy that we are debating here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned to read in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> an article entitled `More young to see violent TV'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional provisions included in the Bill deem various instruments made under the 1983 Act to have been made under the new Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), and after that lengthy interlude I follow the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) who spent most of his time being very critical of the actions of the Kennett Government. He failed to acknowledge at any time that the Kennett Government has been forced to take drastic action in that State because of the appalling legacy of debt that was left behind by the previous Labor Government. That is pretty much the history of Labor when it comes to managing money. The debacle in Victoria is matched by what is going on in South Australia and the troubles in Western Australia. In a sense, we are also seeing some of that at the Federal level with the introduction of the Appropriation Bills this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These Bills demonstrate yet again that Labor has no capacity to manage a Budget, and that Labor cannot be trusted with money. These Bills put to death for all time the One Nation statement. Its fundamental strategy has failed. The Government is withdrawing funds from the railway projects and the electricity project has not even got off the ground. The One Nation statement has dismally failed. The Government is getting out of those projects because its mates in the unions would not agree to any kind of reasonable development of the railway system. Those opposite are backing out and putting the money into short term artificial job creation projects&mdash;projects which will not create any national wealth, which will do nothing to restore our national economy, and which are designed with only one purpose: to shorten the unemployment queues slightly with an election in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government quickly brings forward these projects that were planned over longer periods with an election target date in mind. With that kind of attitude, these Bills need to be seen for the threadbare nature in which they really stand. The Bills are extraordinary in that they were announced before the Senate had approved the Budget Bills. In spite of the giggling Ministers, the fact is that the Government's Budget strategy was in disarray before the Bills even got through the Senate. That demonstrates the incapacity of this Government to develop a consistent fiscal approach to the economy. It is no wonder that we therefore have the disaster at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's record in economic affairs can be traced through a line of failed Budgets, failed mini-Budgets, failed economic statements, failed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building a competitive Australia</EMPHASIS> statement and now, once and for all, the total failure of the One Nation statement. They have all been flops. They have provided no direction and no leadership. This flurry of statements, this pretence of activity, has done nothing to restore our national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rants and raves in Question Time, he is covering up an unemployment queue that has grown to one million. He is covering up a Budget deficit admitted to be $13.4 billion, but obviously most observers believe it to be significantly worse than that. The Australian people do not need to be told that our country is facing serious economic trouble with a $160 billion debt, our national productivity has reached an abysmally low level, and we have been overtaken by countries around the world as we slide down the productivity index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was impressed with some of the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall), who referred to the state of the Heinz company in Australia at present. Heinz is moving to acquire the Watties interests in New Zealand because it has looked at the world scene and knows that it is more efficient to produce goods in that country than it is in ours. What a tragedy that is for Australian industry and for Australian producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Heinz was able to report that the oncosts in New Zealand are less than half of the oncosts in this country. To employ someone in New Zealand costs 64 per cent of what it costs to employ someone in Australia. In Australia, payroll tax is 7 per cent; in New Zealand it is nought. Workers compensation in Australia is 7 per cent; in New Zealand it is 3 per cent. Superannuation in Australia is 4 per cent; in New Zealand it is 2 per cent. New Zealanders get three weeks annual leave; Australians get four. New Zealanders work a 40-hour week, whereas Australians work a 36 1/4-hour week. What is most important, they are able to negotiate flexible working arrangements, which we have been unable to achieve in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telling point was the statement which the honourable member for McMillan repeated. When Heinz was asked whether it would look at constructing a greenfields factory in Australia, the answer was, `No, it would be more economically sensible to do it in New Zealand'. So, that is where our economy has slid under the program that has been put forward by this Government over recent years. But that is not the end of it. The one million unemployed are the symptom of this economic mismanagement, as well as the one-third of adult Australians now receiving some kind of social security benefit and the one-third or more of youth who are unemployed. Yet, in spite of the fact that this Government, the biggest taxing government in our history, despite the fact that the Labor Government has trebled income taxes, multiplied fuel tax six times, increased indirect tax threefold, it has still produced a Budget deficit of $13.4 billion, the biggest in our national history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we sit here debating this Bill, the Government is running up a loss of $1.5m every hour of the financial year. Sadly, what that means is that every Australian worker will have to pay at least $2,000 extra in tax at some time in the future just to pay off this year's Budget deficit. It is about time the Government came out and started telling the Australian people how it will collect that $2,000 from every individual Australian worker just to pay off this year's deficit. That is a really telling challenge that it must answer if it is going to retain any kind of credibility. So, instead of providing real answers to the national economy, it comes out again with yet another revision of yet another one of its mini statements through these Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that 11.3 per cent of our work force is unemployed is a demonstration of the magnitude of our national tragedy. Of course, many others have given up altogether looking for work. When we look at the Government's attempts over recent times to try to salvage the economy of the country, it is really a litany of disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular program, it has given up altogether any attempts to try to fundamentally restore the national economy or to do anything about rebuilding the infrastructure. This recommitment of expenditure is to boost additional artificial work creation schemes&mdash;programs that last only as long as the taxpayer continues to pay the wages bill. What is left&mdash;a few community improvements which are appreciated by those who have them, but no fundamental restructuring or improvement in our national economic base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the major element of this new program, it involves providing major subsidies to large employers who are prepared to engage an extra 100 people who have been out of work for six months or more. Those subsidies are up to $5,000 per employee. This is a typical approach of this Labor Government to national problems. This ALP Government has a solution involving big business, big unions and big mates. It has altogether lost sight of the fact that it is small business</PARA>
<PARA>that employs most Australians. Our future recovery is critically dependent upon the confidence of small business. It is because small businesses lack the confidence to employ that our unemployment rate is as bad as it is. What these measures will, in fact, ensure is that small business will have to pay higher taxes to fund the subsidies for large business, which will further put aside any chances of a national recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting element is the decision of the Government to advance spending on the local capital works program. It announced $55m as being allocated for this purpose. I got a call very quickly from a council which was keen to get its share of this extra money that was announced as a part of these particular measures. But, of course, there is no extra money at all. It is just an accountant's trick, bringing forward a little bit of additional money that was programmed to be spent later. As the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) told us in Question Time, local government was very good at this job creation scheme and got on to it quicker than the Government expected. That just reflected its lack of understanding of local government. Local government is always able to respond very quickly, particularly when somebody gives it money. It is pretty quick to put its hand up and want more. It is very good at creating those sorts of jobs very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that, if people are going to be out of work for long periods of time, they do have some opportunity to exercise their time in a productive way. These kinds of programs at least contribute something to the communities that benefit but, more importantly, they provide an opportunity for workers to maintain their work skills and to retain the work ethic. That is very important for people facing long periods of unemployment. So it was not surprising that local government was able to respond very quickly and promptly to this opportunity to create jobs in local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in local government are very concerned about the way in which this particular funding has been handed out. It has, of course, gone to those local authorities with above average levels of unemployment. The Government's strategy in that regard has obviously been shot to pieces by an announcement also in this latest mini-Budget that it is going to spend a significant amount of money on employment creation projects in Canberra, such as the redevelopment of the old Parliament House. Canberra has only half the national average unemployment and yet it is to get one of the biggest grants that have been handed out in these schemes anywhere. So there is a great degree of inconsistency there and I can fully understand the feelings of local authorities which have missed out on this chance to participate in the local capital works program because they are half a per cent under the national average of unemployment, when they look at Canberra being given this generous allocation, even though its unemployment rate is so very much lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Maryborough City Council within my own electorate was one to take up this cause. It wrote to the Prime Minister expressing its concern that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the unemployed in local authority areas such as Maryborough, where numbers are slightly lower than the national average, were totally ignored in the recently announced unemployment grants to local authorities. Council believes that the unemployed, no matter where they live, must be considered and the fact that they live in an area of lower unemployment than the national average should not be a reason why they do not receive some assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps there needs to be a bit more imaginative consideration of the whole question of unemployment relief and the payment of unemployment benefits. Council believes that there is no productivity in the existing method of paying unemployment benefits. All of Australia would benefit if some productivity could be realised from the billions of dollars already paid out in benefits. It is suggesting therefore that it is time that some alternatives to the handout system were addressed. Initiatives such as channelling benefit payments through local authorities could see a vast improvement in the nation's productivity at no extra cost to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>It is backing a cause that is very popular in local government, namely some kind of a work for unemployment benefit scheme. Local government has demonstrated that it can work through the implementation of the local capital works program. If the Government needs any further illustration, it need look no further than the Aboriginal program, the community development program, which provides work for unemployment benefit type projects around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That scheme has worked particularly well in Aboriginal communities. I give by way of an example two communities, one in my own electorate and one outside. Cherbourg declined to take up this particular program when it was first offered. The Woorabinda settlement eagerly embraced this program and has been actively involved in it. Hundreds of people have now left Cherbourg to go to Woorabinda so that they can participate in the program and Cherbourg is anxious to be included in the scheme now as well. So it has worked extremely well in Aboriginal communities. They have noticed the improvements that have been provided through the scheme and they have noticed the improvement in attitude amongst the people who were previously developing a welfare mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the principle works well in Aboriginal communities, if it works for the Government in the local capital works program, I can see no logical reason why it cannot be applied more universally. Of course, in Fightback, we do promise to provide some additional work experience to people who are long term unemployed. We are keen on the idea of providing community service. I think that many people who are unemployed and have been unemployed for a long period would like to participate in a program of this kind. I hope that, eventually, we can see a widespread national scheme of providing work for people in return for their unemployment benefit payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ironies associated with the extension of these artificial jobs into areas where there are high levels of unemployment is that, in many of the areas where these job creation schemes are being undertaken, there are large numbers of jobs that the unemployed will not take. There was a banner headline in the Maryborough <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> yesterday which read, `Jobless shun crops'. The situation is that there are hundreds of jobs available picking crops in the Bundaberg, Maryborough, Gympie and Mundubbera areas, and there is no-one available to take them on. Crops are being ploughed into the ground because people will not take on these picking jobs. There are many examples. On Tuesday a case was reported on the ABC of a farmer who required 50 tomato pickers. The CES sent 250 names to the farmer and only two people turned up. There is another story from a farmer who rang my office a few days ago. He has had to abandon 10 acres of button squash and five acres of zucchinis because he could not get the crop picked. The CES referred people to him. He got 56 calls and only one person turned up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these people find it much more comfortable to receive the unemployment benefit than to go out and do the picking jobs. I am told that each year in Mundubbera in the citrus season there are a thousand jobs that go unfilled because no-one will come to help with the work. Yet people are collecting unemployment benefit and lining up for special jobs under the capital works program. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chronicle</EMPHASIS> made a particularly interesting observation from one farmer who had to abandon his crops of snow peas and zucchinis. He said this about getting somebody from the unemployment queue to come and work:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If they did do some picking, they would only work until they raised $60 or so a fortnight so they didn't jeopardise their dole.</PARA>
<PARA>Their priority is to do just enough work to earn a few dollars to supplement their dole payment but not enough to get themselves out of the unemployment cycle. There is something immoral about farmers ploughing their vegetables into the field, and oranges being left to fall off the trees, while we are creating artificial job programs in these communities. We need to come to grips with these very important issues and make sure that, when jobs are available, those who are unemployed take up those jobs, earn the income that is available from them and contribute constructively to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Government to carefully administer the social security programs and ensure that the CES recognises the important role that farmers and others who have got jobs that need to be filled can play when there are large pools of unemployed who are available but not willing to work. We are told that the CES will not even list a lot of these positions because they do not fit their criteria in relation to the award arrangements and the fact that they are only part time jobs, temporary jobs, and not full time positions. Those sorts of rules should not be allowed to get in the way of achieving what is best for the people concerned and what is best for the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other measures included in these Appropriation Bills is the advance of some additional funds for the black spot program. It is good to see some additional funding trickling through to roads from this Government over the last year or two. After all, the Government has multiplied its receipts from fuel excise by six times, so it is appropriate that there should be more money for roads. But, in practice, the Government has frozen road funding for most of its term in office. Only in recent times has there been any additional expenditure for roads. Is it any wonder that we need to spend more money on black spots? There are so many more black spots because of all of the neglect over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frightening thing about the Government's projections for road funding&mdash;and the Budget documents confirm these numbers&mdash;is that in 1994-95 there will actually be fewer dollars available for road funding than were spent in 1983-84. So in spite of the passage of more than a decade the Government is going to spend less than it did at that time. There is a small, short term boost now, but no plans for any continuing proper funding of our national road system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to inform you that I am under considerable pressure from my colleagues to speak at short length this evening because of the lateness of the hour. So I will keep to the promise that I will speak for only a couple of minutes. I would imagine that the listening audience around the House and out there in the nation has somewhat diminished. If I speak for only a couple of minutes, and the other side agrees, we may not even have an adjournment debate. It is the end of a very long session, and I am sure we are all worn out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, at a time when we are debating Appropriations, I would like to make some remarks about some of those expenditures that come through the Department for which I have some responsibility, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. I refer, in particular, to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, whose job it is to keep the statistics that measure the health of the nation, as well as the vital statistics about how it is we deliver health services. I have had an interest in this area for some time. It is particularly important that we establish an independent authority to measure these things. As we all know, politicians are somewhat subject to improper use of statistics by lobby groups, which serve them up in the newspapers all the time as proof that a particular program, subject or whatever ought to receive more Commonwealth funds. We are somewhat susceptible to that pressure when it gets easy publicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just take the House through some favourite social statistics of mine in the health area that might, if they go unchecked, cause a government to spend money that it might not otherwise find necessary to spend. They are favourites of mine. There are three deliberate errors, I would suggest, that are made on behalf of groups or lobbyists or organisations, or whatever, that want to demonstrate that their area of need is more important than anyone else's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the old problem of double counting. A couple of years ago there was a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> which said that one in four children in Queensland lives in poverty. That riled me somewhat because, firstly, I knew it to be untrue, and, secondly, I knew the source of the data. The data was what we call WELSTAT information, which is basically a collection of data for a lot of agencies that give out emergency relief funds; it is Commonwealth money. The problem is, though, it counts the same family two, three, four, five or six times. In other words, if one family goes to six different agencies in the course of a six-month period, or a year or whatever, it is counted separately. A family may even go to two agencies on the same day. There is no way that those statistics could properly measure child poverty in my State, or in any State. There was an abuse of those statistics. I was in contact with the groups that held those statistics just to make sure that I was correct in my assumptions that they were double and triple counting. I was correct. That sort of nonsense does not go on any more with those figures. So we are not subject to those sorts of figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that recently we have extended the role of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to pick up the role of the measurement of welfare. We will be going into the measurement in areas such as child welfare, where we will be talking about such crucial things as adoptions, child maltreatment, children in care, juvenile offenders, as well as some measurement of income, poverty, inter-child-care, disability services, aged care and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other statistic I see from time to time that is a misuse of social statistics&mdash;I will have to be very careful that my words are not misinterpreted&mdash;is what I will call an improperly wide definition of a problem. We will get a statistic that will read something like: one in four women are subjected to sexual abuse at some stage. On the surface, that may be a reasonable thing; the statistics may be accurate. But the trouble is that the definition of `sexual abuse' will often range from rape through to bad language. You get a wide definition of events that have almost nothing in common and, if you add up all of the so-called abuses within that incredibly wide definition, it may be possible to get a figure that one in four women are subject at some stage to a form of sexual abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I suggest occurs here is that anyone's normal sense of what is sexual abuse or what is the improper treatment of women is stretched to such an extent that the whole statistic lacks credibility. What do we do when we read that sort of statistic? We walk away from it. We do not believe it. We are not interested in the topic. Social statistics need to be couched in such a way that they have an amount of credibility that will make the reader want to inquire further and to believe that it is a decent area of endeavour that we should be interested in and should devote Commonwealth funds to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third common way of misrepresenting needs through social statistics is to take a measurement across a person's lifetime. To some extent, I am putting together these notions; they are not perfect by any means. Something like one in four Australians will be subjected to a bout of mental illness at some time in their lives. These statistics compress all the possibilities of a bout of mental illness&mdash;and I suspect that is a wide definition&mdash;to one point in time. For instance, many old people will be subjected to some definition of a bout of mental illness, because the process of ageing, as I understand it, does cause some depression. Anyone in his or her entire lifespan of 60, 70 or 80 years might have one incident of this event called mental depression. Representing this in a single statistic at one point in time is trying to represent something that happens at one point in time to millions of people across seven or eight decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By all these different means of building a case through the use of social and health statistics, I find that as a politician I am subjected to the pressure of those sorts of statistics. People lobby me on the basis of this sort of representation of their argument. I am very wary of those sorts of representations and arguments brought to Government by people presuming that their case is more important than anyone else's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that illustration, I compliment the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on its work. In some ways, its job is to be the umpire of many of these sorts of measurements; to give us something that is credible, predictable and properly measured across a whole range of statistics in the area of health, and now welfare, in Australian society so that I, as an individual member, or the Deputy Speaker or honourable members opposite, have a reference point to which to refer to see whether any of the often improperly but popularly recognised data has any validity. I say that by way of bringing to the attention of the House the considerable amount of money that we devote to the proper gathering of statistics, which we believe are very valuable tools, in order that we spend taxpayers' money properly. I again congratulate the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on its work. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Kerry O'Brien observed on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, the Government laboured mightily to come up with a document that would match Fightback. The transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program makes very interesting reading. I think it should be compulsory reading. The only pity about it is that it was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> and not on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> or something in prime time. There was a suggestion that we could make it available on the parliamentary network so that at least all members of parliament could make themselves familiar with the performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry O'Brien asked the Prime Minister, `After nine months, how many of the fundamental assumptions of the One Nation statement remain true?'. The Prime Minister was not able to answer that. He went on to make a complete fool of himself by his inability to answer not only that question but also every other question that Kerry O'Brien put to him. It became fairly obvious that, although in Question Time he gets away with bluster, obfuscation, abuse and exaggeration&mdash;and just about everything else&mdash;on this occasion he could not escape from Kerry O'Brien. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Kerry O'Brien pointed out to the Prime Minister, the One Nation growth forecast for the economy was 4.75 per cent. He pointed out that in June this was revised downwards to 4 per cent. In August, six months later, because the Budget came out, it was down to 3 per cent. Three wrong estimates in nine months! The Prime Minister did not have any answer for that. That was early in the interview. From there on the Prime Minister's performance on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> was all downhill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next Kerry O'Brien asked him about job creation&mdash;a pretty important question to ask the Prime Minister in these circumstances. Kerry O'Brien observed that job creation figures were predicated on those growth projections. He made the reasonable assumption that the growth projections were now thrown out and wanted to know how the job creation figures stacked up. Kerry O'Brien pointed out that there had been 30,000 jobs created from February to October under the One Nation statement, but unfortunately there were 65,000 additional unemployed. In other words, there was a net loss of 35,000 in employment generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kerry O'Brien asked the Prime Minister, `Doesn't that put something of a hole in your projections that there would be between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs created by One Nation?'. `Not at all', said the Prime Minister. This was a really tough one for him to get out of, but it was fairly obvious that he was not able to answer that question&mdash;nor could he answer it; it is an impossible question to answer. Presumably, in February when One Nation was released the Prime Minister stood up in this place and said, `Here we have the answer. We are going to create between 150,000 and 200,000 jobs in a year'. I am not sure whether he meant the year from February 1992 to February 1993. Perhaps he meant the next financial year. Either way, his progress to date is minus 35,000. He is not doing too well, and things will have to pick up awfully quickly. These Appropriation Bills are about the Government re-ordering priorities and spending money as quickly as it can to create a few more temporary jobs before the election. It is interesting that the whole program ends on 31 May. That is what the Appropriation Bill says. The timing is significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both One Nation and the Budget brought down in August are now completely discredited. These Bills are an admission of that. These Bills represent a further indictment of this Government's mismanagement of the Australian economy&mdash;not only in recent years, but perhaps over the last 10 years. It created the recession through mismanagement and now it is rushing in to try to fix it up with mickey mouse job creation schemes&mdash;schemes that are only aimed at getting people off the dole until the election. That is what these Bills are all about. We do not oppose them because they are Budget Bills, but we certainly think the whole thing is laughable. </PARA>

Of course, he quoted an eminent source that said fiscal stimulus was fine provided, to put it clearly, a government did not waste the money; in other words, that it put it into some grand infrastructure scheme. He said that that is where this Government differed from those that got into RED schemes and all those things of the past where people painted rocks white and certainly escalated the pine forest industry because they put up pine rails wherever they could, built footpaths where people never walked, et cetera. That is what he told us this afternoon during Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are debating Bills that take money away from those infrastructure projects, those rail extension projects and those electricity grid projects, and put it into painting rocks. Why? The Treasurer, in delivering these speeches, is at pains to say that that is not what is going to happen, but it is very clear that it is. He talks about labour market programs and all that old-fashioned dogma where the Government, in its desperation to retain office, wants to just spend money. The pity of it is that it is money the nation does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any money that this Government borrows today is borrowed from overseas. Of course, Government members would stand up&mdash;I have heard Bob Hawke and the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as Treasurer say this&mdash;and say that this Government has very low foreign borrowings. Well, we know that. We know that the Commonwealth does not have to borrow overseas unless it is trying to fill some gap in some foreign currency requirements. It borrows on the local markets. Those who give the Commonwealth the money go and borrow it overseas. They must borrow it overseas for the simple fact that we owe the world $185,000m. While we have that level of debt overseas, there are clearly no net savings here in Australia. They might be there for minutes; they come and go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It borrows money to fund this rock painting exercise and these pine rails. We heard the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) today telling us how he had got his new schemes in place and how successful they were. Of course they were successful. Every local authority said, `We will take the money'. That is not surprising. But I have seen how it is being spent around my electorate, and I have to tell honourable members that it will do nothing for the national economy at all. People will walk a little less distance to a public toilet&mdash;that is convenient&mdash;but I am afraid that what they do there will not expand our export effort. It is as simple as that. That is what the money is being spent on. It is not creating real jobs. In some cases, it will create no jobs at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was told in the town of Geraldton of the money that would be spent there, I suggested that maybe they could get some of the final year apprentices in that town to go and build these toilet blocks, because those kids are currently on the scrap heap. They have been retrenched, particularly final year apprentices. This is the problem all around Australia. People have been retrenched because under the current award system their wages are very nearly that of a full tradesman. Of course, as the pressure has gone onto business and it has lacked the turnover because of the `recession we had to have', business has turned around and said, `Well, which apprentice should we retrench&mdash;the one that has just started on very low wages or the one that is on very high wages?'. It has retrenched the one on high wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these apprentices are only months away from completing their indentures.

We are prepared to back our child so that he can complete his indentures'. They have two problems: first, they would like to see their child conclude and become a tradesman; and, second, if their child does not conclude by a certain time, all the time put in to date has been lost. There is a finite period in which a person must complete his indentures as an apprentice. </PARA>

The Prime Minister, who had been running around the countryside, started telling us that he was not really borrowing money to make Australians feel good and then spending it; he was not really doing it for that purpose. He said that there was a higher authority. He had woken up in the middle of the night, a flash of light had come through the window and a voice had said, `I'm the OECD and I'm here to tell you, Prime Minister, to go out and borrow money.

Somehow or other that became a great economic decision of the 100 million voters of America. Of course, when we get down to tintacks, the same OECD that the Prime Minister said had given him the authority to borrow more money and put Australia's children further into debt&mdash;and please remember Mr Deputy Speaker, that you and I, unfortunately, do not have all that much time left on this earth and we have only a limited amount of that debt to repay; it is the 15-and 16-year-olds and younger who are going to have to pay off the debts that this Government has contracted on their behalf&mdash;said to America after the vote of the people that it did not advise it to go further into government budget deficit because it could not afford it; it was too far in already.

It was $10 billion because the Government's discredited Tax Commissioner wrote it some letters and said, `This is how much money I can screw out of the Australian people'.

Using the government statisticians' figures, we find that in the last 12 months, since this market has been deregulated in New Zealand, New Zealand workers have seen the real value of their wages increased by one per cent.

The New Zealand worker gets for his New Zealand dollar exactly the same product value as the Australian gets for his Australian dollar.

But if they get to open it, fill out the form and send it back by 30 December, the Government will say, `We may not have had time to issue the necessary registration number you need to get the new exemption. But don't you worry about that. We'll give you the exemption anyway. You just tell your supplier that you've sent in your application form'. There are two little problems with that. I do not believe there is anything in the new Act which allows the Government to give an exemption. I believe that farmers and everybody else will have to pay the cash for the sales tax and that they will have to recover it if they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that today the Prime Minister waxed lyrical about poor little sporting organisations. He was desperately worried that they might be caught up in the GST. Again, that was fraud by omission. The documents on the GST are quite clear. Anybody with a turnover under $50,000 does not have to report it under GST. They do not have to do all the book work that almost brought the Prime Minister to tears, as he described all these little treasurers around the place. They just do not have to be involved. They will pick up a little GST at 15 per cent for the things they buy. The Minister might like to tell us what a little small sporting club actually buys. But they do not have to report a turnover under $50,000. Any sporting equipment that they buy will no longer have sales tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now getting representations associated with this new scheme that say that kids who feed their ponies are going to have to pay 20 per cent tax on their prepared stockfeed. I believe that is to be the case. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns): what exemption are those kids going to get? Horses are a thing that generally create great character in a child. They cannot kick it under the bed like a cricket bat or a football. But the Government is going to tax the food that those kids feed their horses with. Some of them will lose their horses as a result of that. So much for the crocodile tears of the Prime Minister!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this document is not available. Farmers have not got it. It is an administrative mess. One wonders why the Government has to borrow all this money. It is because we have a Treasurer who does not know how to run his Department. When he was asked the first question about it, he did not even know what was going on. He came back to the Parliament later and produced a press release from his Commissioner. But he is yet to explain to the Parliament how, under the legislation he passed through this place, the Government can give exemption to people. He has yet to explain how a retailer will be protected if he sells something free of sales tax on the word of someone who says, `I've sent my form in. Believe me; trust me'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1992-93 and Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1992-93 I wish to comment on the social as well as financial implication of the Bills. The costs involved in financing the substantial labour market programs and local capital works programs in the Bills must reflect, in part, bungled economic policies at a national level which, when combined with the $29.5 billion being paid out to State, Territory and local governments in 1992-93, is a timely reminder of the incredible financial disasters which State Labor governments have inflicted on the Australian people over the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the core of these disasters lies the foul-up of the decade, the inept deregulation of the financial system, of which the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his former capacity as Treasurer, was the principal architect. This provided a stimulus for a range of debacles, from the $3.1 billion black hole in the State Bank of South Australia, which has seen former Premier John Bannon summarily dispatched to oblivion&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;to the now increasingly publicised offshore rorting of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Victoria, successive Auditor-General's reports have exposed a damning list of illegal, improper and artificial financing transactions made to disguise the true extent of Labor's damage to Victoria. Not so long ago we had the royal commission report into Tricontinental, the merchant banking arm of what was the State Bank of Victoria, revealing accumulated losses of $2.4 billion. No one was held responsible, and no charges were laid. This is disgracefully typical of the lack of accountability for the disasters of the 1980s. Labor's maladministration and gross incompetence in governing Victoria, now legendary, was the major cause of the decisive outing of Premier Kirner and her Government in the 3 October election. It is now the awesome task of the Kennett Government to implement such unpalatable and difficult measures as are necessary to redress the dire economic circumstances of my own State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, the findings of the royal commission into Western Australia Inc. have uncovered massive rorts involving Labor notables, past and present, particularly ex-Premier Brian Burke. It seems likely that at the Western Australian State election early in 1993, Premier Lawrence will suffer the same very well-deserved fate as Premier Kirner in Victoria. It is interesting that recently, since the obvious failures of economic rationalism have been revealed, Labor Party high flyers&mdash;notably the Prime Minister&mdash;have been surreptitiously distancing themselves from the very policies which they implemented in the 1980s. Those policies are now proven failures and are a terrible indictment of Australia's lost 10 years under the Prime Minister and his predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very desperate measures contained in these Appropriation Bills now before us illustrate aptly the extent to which economic rationalist policies of the 1980s have adversely affected the lives of Australian people. Even the 1992-93 Budget briefing papers provided by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) acknowledge `that a return to full employment will not be easily or quickly achieved'. That would have to be the understatement of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of these Bills now before us may be properly termed the anatomy of despair. Moreover, labour market and training measures contained in the Treasurer's Budget briefing papers, which involve the outlay of $768m in 1992-93, $665.8m in 1993-94, $430.8m in 1994-95, and $108.9m in 1995-96, not only illustrate the enormity of the unemployment problem but also are evidence of the numbers of hidden unemployed which do not appear in official Department of Social Security statistics. Mr Terry McCrann, in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 18 February 1992, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, then, we could say that unemployment was really pushing 2 million or just over 20 %. But that is not what the official numbers say.</PARA>
<PARA>A survey published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 13 March 1992, carried out by Ballarat University College for the Brotherhood of St Laurence, found that one in five workers in that city were unemployed in September 1991. The research has raised serious questions about the methods used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to determine the unemployment rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, on 25 August 1992 the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> published findings of a supplementary ABS survey which painted the bleak picture of 1,971,800 Australians, or 21.2 per cent of the work force, aged between 15 and 69 years, having been unemployed at some time during the year to March 1992. The comment made by Sara Dowse in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Society</EMPHASIS> article of June 1991 is worth noting. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current situation says a great deal about the inroads economic rationalism has made on our national psyche and government that we can feel satisfied about levels of unemployment which would have been unacceptable in the previous decade and considered cataclysmic in the 1960's, when a rate of 2% in 1963 nearly brought down the Menzies Government.</PARA>
<PARA>In an article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Executive Action</EMPHASIS> of May-June 1992 entitled `The welfare state or the bureaucratic state', Mr Marcus L'Estrange sums up Labor's attitude towards unemployment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If only the unemployed would retrain, sign a Newstart agreement, join a job club, obtain a doctorate in literacy/numeracy/job application skills, all would be well, cry Ministers Dawkins/Beazley and Baldwin. Jobs will come forth like water in a desert.</PARA>
<PARA>The human face of the jobless statistics and measures introduced to cope with them&mdash;unemployment benefits, job training schemes and so on, as well as the labour market and capital works programs encompassed in these Bills&mdash;is one of utter misery in both urban and rural areas. </PARA>

<PARA>When contacted, a spokesman from Lifeline in Melbourne was reluctant to comment on the recession as it affected the Lifeline service. That is understandable. However, according to an article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 15 October, the Reverend Dr Gordon Moyes, the superintendent of Sydney's Wesley Mission, invited the Prime Minister to listen anonymously `to the heartbeat of the nation'. He criticised the Prime Minister for saying that the recession had ended. Dr Moyes said that the increased calls to Lifeline proved that people were still suffering. Dr Moyes said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He's talking to the wrong people. The people he is talking to are the survivors.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Jean McCaughey, principal researcher for the Australian Institute of Family Studies, commented on a study undertaken in 1991 at the request of Hanover Welfare Services, a Victorian non-government welfare organisation concerned about the increasing number of families with children seeking assistance with basic housing needs. Ms McCaughey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the 1980's was seen to be the decade of youth homelessness in Australia, the present increase in the numbers of family groups seeking emergency accommodation suggests an alarming new pattern of homeless people in the 1990's.</PARA>
<PARA>The article appears in the AIFS journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Matters</EMPHASIS> of 13 December 1991. The study found that frequent moves necessitated by economic circumstances had a very destabilising effect on families including children. These are a few of the quotations obtained from family members during the study:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The kids at school used to pick on us. They'd call us names like maggots because mum couldn't afford to buy us nice clothes and we were always sort of untidy going to school.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. I was at so many schools I can't remember. I used to like school but all the problems at home reflected on it. I had to leave at 15 because mum and dad couldn't afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. We shifted a dozen times. If we couldn't move our furniture, we'd just sell the bloody lot for whatever we could get and buy again.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite such obvious disadvantages, Ms McCaughey commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the whole, though, it is remarkable that their personal resources enabled so many families to maintain warm and close relationships through all their vicissitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advocacy is an important element of help for homeless people. It is needed with public housing authorities, with government departments (particularly the Department of Social Security) . . . Unfortunately the study showed that the requirements and methods of government services tend to increase pressures on families and make things more difficult for them at the very point that they are most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to another article in the same journal of 30 April 1992, co-authored by Peter McDonald and Helen Brownlee, both of the AIFS, unemployment statistics do not tell the whole story of the recession, although the figures are alarming enough. In November 1991 there were 187,000 couples with children&mdash;9.3 per cent of all&mdash;where neither parent was employed; there were 211,000 sole parents&mdash;53 per cent of all&mdash;who were not employed. In total, about 710,000 dependent children and 585,000 parents lived in families in which no parent was employed. Not all parents were actively looking for work. Some were sick and some were caring for others. Many were discouraged job seekers who had given up looking for work after many unsuccessful attempts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Matters</EMPHASIS> of August 1992, AIFS Director, Don Edgar, in an article `Families in unemployment', wrote of 10,000 people contacting the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Melbourne, since February, seeking clothing and furniture, compared with 5,800 during the same period last year. He instanced 1,100 families per month seeking food vouchers and accommodation at the Salvation Army's Family Welfare Centre in Bourke Street, Melbourne. Recently, the number has soared to 1,600 families a month. Victoria's 64 citizens advice bureaus have received 17,500 calls for emergency relief in the first three months of this year, compared with 12,000 for the same period last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians in rural areas are also suffering pain and despair due to the recession. But because of the complex and variable nature of farming and because of the lack of the kind of survey work done in city areas, the enormous difficulties are harder to pinpoint. Small to medium farmers contacted in Victoria and South Australia&mdash;some of whom are in danger of having to leave their land because of failure to pay mortgages and so on&mdash;see their problems as emanating from the incompetent and destructive deregulation of the banking system during the 1980s. Many were actively encouraged to borrow sums for farm improvement and so on at the most enormous interest rates. One South Australian quoted interest rates of up 30 per cent being charged to farmers during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some farmers' children are eligible for Austudy but, even so, there are financial difficulties because so many students from the rural areas must be educated in the city. There is asset testing of the family allowance for properties worth over $600,000 regardless of income. Rural counsellor, Sue Grimmer, from the Western District of Victoria, told of the great difficulties of her clients. She quoted the example of one married couple who were living on $50 per week. She said that they `didn't starve because they killed their own sheep to eat', but life was still very grim for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major feature article written by Steve Cooper for the Victorian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> of 26 August this year has predicted that as many as one in five farmers will leave the land during the next five years. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government says 25,000 of the nation's 125,615 farmers are at risk financially or are unviable in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>The catalyst will be the revamping of the Federal Government's rural adjustment scheme to include extra aid for farmers who are forced off the land. The Minister responsible, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), took a hard line when introducing a new drought policy in August this year. He said, `There is no point in prolonging the inevitable for the farmer who will never make it'. To ease the pain of change, it is believed that increased financial incentives of up to $50,000 will be offered to help farmers adjust off the land. At present the figure is an amount of up to $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, some farmers have grouped themselves into organisations such as the Australia First campaign and Bank Watch Action groups to make certain that no farming family has to leave its property if it does not wish to do so. Farmers are ashamed and angry. One farmer's wife commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Country people are very proud. They are ashamed now that they find it difficult to pay their way.</PARA>
<PARA>A young man who was hoping to be able to take over the property of his parents was concerned about the break-up of rural communities and their loss of services. A South Australian farmer made perhaps the most telling point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is saying that we have to go. But to where? To the city to join the ranks of the unemployed? I intend to stay on my land.</PARA>
<PARA>The human face behind the statistics of the Department of Social Security makes it clear that we need a new vision for Australia. Such a vision must not only encompass the requisite economic, industry, industrial relations and other policy elements vital to the restoration of prosperity, but also look to giving back dignity and confidence to those Australians cast aside over the last decade in so cavalier a manner. Only a Federal Liberal-National Party government, with a purposeful and imaginative program applied with commonsense and compassion, can provide that vision. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Appropriation Bills that we are debating in this House tonight go beyond this. As the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) stated when he introduced the Bills into the House, the Government's One Nation statement was specifically designed to revitalise our nation's key economic infrastructures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased when Cabinet realistically, in examining what was happening with the expenditure of money since the presentation of the One Nation statement, decided to reallocate some of the money to areas such as local government, as was mentioned by the Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons) in the House today and previously. It has been proven that at a local level there is the wherewithal, and certainly the expertise, but most particularly&mdash;with aid money being paid over and above what has been raised through rate revenue&mdash;the ability, to get on quickly with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people on both sides of this House have been very critical of that, but particularly in the Opposition. It has been said that we are buying votes by expending part of that appropriation money on local government. I completely disagree with that. When we see the works now being done&mdash;not only throughout my State but throughout Australia&mdash;we see the multiplying effect associated with the expenditure of that dollar. And that happens very quickly. It is putting solid work into those communities. The benefits are immediate. We are seeing those communities grow and expand because of the input of that money. In other words, they are being kick-started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel dejected at times when I look at how some of the money has been reallocated. We hear continual harping from the Opposition about where money is not being spent, how badly it is being spent or where it should be spent. For once I would like the Opposition to congratulate this Government on what we have been able to do in the training field, particularly with our unemployed people, by at least providing facilities and by making available&mdash;through our Jobstart, Job Search and Jobskill programs&mdash;the opportunity for those people to learn and to acquire extra skills so that when the economy does pick up, as it is slowly doing now, they will have the expertise to go out into the community and make a worthwhile contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather ironic, when we talk about contributions of individuals and, collectively, of small and medium to large business, that we had today a special ceremony in this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gave me a great deal of pleasure to be able to be part of that and to congratulate one particular industry within my electorate of Prospect. We heard that originally it had become one of the five finalists to be awarded the Commonwealth Bank small to medium manufacturing award, hoping against all hopes, of course, that it would win or at least be one of the finalists. I believe it reached that category throughout the country. But not only did it win; it also won the DHL Worldwide Express exporter of the year award. This is a very small industry, founded 18 years ago in my electorate, which has now expanded to two manufacturing plants to become the exporter of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the history associated with this company. In the 1981-82-83 recession period the company admitted that it made a mistake: it decided, when the economy was going down and when business was going flat in that period, to put off men. But it put off men who had expertise and skills, and it took the company many years to put back such a fine team. Today it also admitted that another mistake it made was not to put enough money into research. The company not only had to get a better product, but it had to get a more competitive product, and a product that would be available on the export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this particular industry. The export manager, a very young man of only 28, actually started work with that company, and he is proud to say that he started by sweeping the floors. He worked his way up to understand and to appreciate what the company was all about, and he is now the export manager. I am talking about Cryofab Industries. It manufactures very large storage containers for liquid gas and nitrogen. Very early on, when it started restructuring, the company decided that the limited number of customers it had in Australia was not enough to keep it going and to have expansion, so it went offshore. Now it has large export markets in the Far East, Asia and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four to five years ago it started to build up its export activity.

It is a company that has been able to work with its employees. When it opened its second plant within my electorate&mdash;it has one in Smithfield and one in Wetherall Park&mdash;it allowed its employees to take shares in the company. So it is a company that has expanded with skills, expertise and foresight. </PARA>

But even Austrade said, `We can only provide that assistance. We cannot provide the expertise that this particular company has, and we certainly cannot give it the money it has been able to obtain with those markets. That has come from its own resilience and its own hard work'. </PARA>

Sometimes they only need a hand to assist them to take the first step. Cryofab Industries needed to reassess where it was going. We as a government, through Austrade, were there with a little bit of expertise to give it a helping hand so that it was able to establish itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe also that the programs we have put into place&mdash;particularly our Jobstart and Jobskill programs because I have been so closely involved with them at a local level with employers&mdash;are wonderful schemes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely we have gone past the stage when people would come in here and say, `Oh, yes, I know of a case where so and so is getting the pension and should not be getting that and they are not really separated, they are really living together' and would therefore maintain that no-one should be assisted because of that individual case which they knew about. We still hear that sort of thing. I say to those people today, `Don't talk about that one case. If you feel that way, report it. But, most particularly, commend and congratulate the other nine who are receiving assistance and doing it so well'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through our programs we are training the youth of today to enter the work force and retraining older people to get back into the work force. We should sing loudly the praises and the achievements of those who are getting there. We should sing loudly the praises of companies such as Cryofab which have achieved because they have got off their backsides and have been prepared to take the risks and take on a team of highly motivated and highly sensitive workers who are prepared to do the job. That is what 99 per cent of the people in this country are like. Perhaps we should assist the other one per cent to take that first step. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Government on these Appropriation Bills and on the way in which this money has been handled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, I appreciate it. The theme this year was: `What it means to me to be an Australian!'. The winner of the junior school prize was Claire Cannon, Year 6, St Francis Xavier College.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the senior school prize, you chose Claire Thomas, who is in year 11 at Sebastopol Secondary College. Honourable mentions were given to Aimee Heuzenroeder from Ballarat and Queens Anglican Grammar School, Shane Begbie from Ballarat and Queens Anglican Grammar School and Aja Bongiorno from Loreto College. I will read these essays to the House. The first one is from Claire Cannon. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australians, we are indeed citizens of "The Lucky Country". We have a wealth of natural resources that many countries lack&mdash;vast, open spaces; beautiful countryside, and a multi-cultural society. Living in a society such as this teaches us that people from other countries may look a little different, speak a different language, but, deep down, they're the same as us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being an Australian means we should help and respect all immigrants. Most of us are descended from foreign families, or may have been born overseas. When we, or our ancestors arrived here, Australia may have been unfamiliar, and possibly, frightening. The sight of a friendly face would have dispelled doubt or fear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only TRULY Australian people are the Aborigines. We should have respect for them and their culture. It is a challenge for us who may not truly understand the Aborigines, and for the Aborigines, who may not truly understand us, to be reconciled. It will be hard to do, but if we make allowances and greet each other with open minds, it can be accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Being Australian also means we should stand by our flag and for what it represents. In the current flag debate, my opinion is that our flag is just about perfect. The Southern Cross is an Australian symbol, and as Australia was originally a British colony, the Union Jack is appropriate. All our flag really needs, I think, is some reference to the Aborigines, the indigenous people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australians we have rights such as the right to vote; the right to stand for election in Federal, State or Local Government, and more. Many people do not have these rights in their countries because of their sex, religion or beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a young Australian, I am proud of the history of our country. Our soldiers have fought bravely in several wars; our government has always been democratic; and the rights of individuals have been respected. The pioneers who settled this vast country did so with a sense of hope and adventure, and that is how we must face the current recession&mdash;with a sense of hope and adventure. Along with that, we should be creative and try to think of ideas to help us pull through. We should be supportive towards one another and, above all, have respect for the land that has given us so much, and still has more to give.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am proud to be Australian!</PARA>
<PARA>The second essay is from Claire Thomas, the winner of the senior section for Sebastopol Secondary College. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is home. There is security in this knowledge and pride in our individual heritage and culture. Australia meets the needs of a vast diversity of people, united only by their love for their country. The composition of Australian society is unlike any other; it is distinctive in its heritage of all who search for a better life. Throughout her short history, Australia has been home to immigrants, and continues to be so. Australia has a quality that attracts people, and the capacity to fulfil their dreams.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes a matter of course for loyalty to influence the manner in which we view our land and tongue. Despite the values, principles and morals affecting our own society, our involvement with society arouses feelings of belonging and provides something we can always call our own. Australia is ours, and despite what we may do to our country, this will always be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do Australians really have so much to be particularly proud of? Is Australia free of the incidents of which it accuses other countries? Does Australia really have a glorious past? These are questions that all communities can answer, and Australians, even in their relative youth, have a belief in their country's attributes and the motivation to act upon them. To a student, there are dreams that may well be realised; there are opportunities available; there is the potential to cater for the fulfilment of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot answer for all, but for many Australians the title implies a relatively free and relaxed lifestyle, the availability of technologies and opportunities to maximize life experiences and the feeling of belonging, understanding and appreciating, which generates loyalty. On the other hand the realities of discrimination, unemployment and poverty cannot be ignored. But one's place of birth is one's domain, and being Australian means I naturally follow the supportive thinking patterns of an Australian, even when this may seem hypocritical. No matter what Australia is held to have done, I am a part of her and her history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be an Australian is to be identified with sun swept plains, bronzed countryside, white washed beaches, freedom of speech and personal rights. To be an Australian is to share the good and bad times with other Australians. To be an Australian is to live richly or poorly, happily or sadly, passively or actively. Above all, to be an Australian is to be proud. Being Australian doesn't just mean stereotype of the "big bronzed Aussie" or the "blond sheila". Every Australian person is unique. Being Australian means having the personal freedom to be an individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flag cannot alter Australia's uniqueness and independence. The status of republic or monarchy cannot alter the fact that we are Australian. No matter what political changes occur, Australia remains Australian and its people maintain allegiance to their homeland. To a young person the flag does not hold the power it does for older generations. Nor does the possibility of republicanism create feelings of betrayal to our Queen. For those who will soon play a greater role in their community, the things of importance are the preservation of their homeland and the people who belong here. In this context, Australia is not so much a physical feature with physical attributes as it is a significant emotional attachment. It is this which makes us proud to be Australian, and truly makes Australia home.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ABC has been under siege in recent years. It has been under siege from the same forces that have waged war on the Australian community through the 1980s. It is under siege from both the Government's funding cuts and the threats of even bigger funding cuts from the Opposition. It has had a steady pressure to increase commercialisation and a reduction of capacity to make programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treatment of the ABC is one of the reasons people are consistently deserting the major parties. With the concentration of media ownership and the commercial censorship that exists in this country now, the ABC is one of the main sources of public information and, as such, it is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the external pressures, the ABC, like all major bureaucracies, has many internal problems. Nothing illustrates the problems of bureaucracy more than the present efforts to get rid of Margaret Throsby. To about a quarter of Australia's people, Margaret Throsby is the personification of ABC radio, the voice of Sydney. After 26 years, the ABC without Margaret Throsby would be a little like Sydney without the Harbour Bridge. Perhaps that is a bad analogy now that the Harbour Bridge has been leased to Kumagai Transfield. It is probably more like Paris without the Eiffel Tower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost unthinkable that some nameless bureaucrat in the ABC can be allowed to take Margaret Throsby off the air. Even worse is the fact that the ABC board could even contemplate such an action. The crime, of which she is supposed to be accused, is that she is taking part in advertisements for the Macquarie Bank. At a time when the Government is corporatising and commercialising almost every institution in the country from Telecom down to the smallest school, I think this reeks of a double standard and, frankly, pettiness. Other ABC personalities have done ads for years: Wendy Harmer, H.G. Nelson, Roy Slaven and Maggie Tabberer. So why pick on Throsby?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Margaret Throsby is a contract employee. She was told before she started the ads that this would not affect her contract. Her ratings are higher than they have ever been; there have been no public complaints whatsoever. She breaches nothing in the code of ethics of the AJA. She has informed the board that she will quite happily comply with whatever policy it decides on doing advertisements at its next meeting in December. Even David Hill accepts the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of all this, she has been pressured and victimised. The pressure has been on to get her to stand down without pay for the last couple of weeks. Now she has been told that there will be no contract next year when she finishes in December. Margaret Throsby has been a Sydney institution. She has informed and given pleasure to millions over the last quarter of a century. I think this Parliament, and particularly every member representing the people of Sydney, should try to prevent the injustice that is being done in the name of petty bureaucracy and perhaps the tall poppy syndrome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Grave concerns about the continuing criminal penetration of the meat industry led to the establishment by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, ABCI, in 1991 of the Jodphur Probe, which in respect of information obtained by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service, AQIS, later reported:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst this infiltration appeared to be happening in several states, the Victorian meat industry appears to be where most activity is taking place with allegations of fraud and drug importation occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> of 23 October 1991, Steve Cooper reporting on meat industry prosecutions for a wide range of offences said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Resources Minister Alan Griffiths is concerned enough to favour strengthening the `fit and proper person' legislative powers and broadening the regulations to take in the domestic meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Where did all these serious expressions of concern eventually leave the meat industry? It would appear, on present indications, not terribly advanced. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekly Times</EMPHASIS> reporter, David Gorrie, in an article of 11 November 1992 headed `Smorgon buys back the farm' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of four works in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia by the Angliss Group to Melbourne's Smorgon family could represent the start of an Australian beef industry revival.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, in that same article, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also make the group the second largest Australian meat processor with 15 per cent market share.</PARA>
<PARA>The report on Probe Jodphur is less laudatory of the Smorgon group. Paragraph 3.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the late 1960s amongst the numerous legitimate operators within the Victorian meat industry, a group run by the Rotstein Brothers was identified as having interests in several boning rooms and abattoirs. Those brothers had alleged associations with known criminals and were supposedly developed as an extension of the Smorgons group who were one of the biggest operators in the industry at the time.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the next decade, in paragraph 3.3, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the mid-1970s another group allegedly run by Norbert Boehm emerged. At that time the meat industry was experiencing some economic problems yet this group who had connections back to the Rotsteins had expanded to the degree that by the end of the decade they were a major force in the industry as part of Steiger operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, of the 1980s, in paragraph 3.10 it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Smorgon Consolidated Industries came under the notice of the Royal Commission with the chief executive Jack Morris being called as a witness. Allegations had been made concerning large scale false halal certification practices but Morris refused to answer questions on the grounds of self-incrimination and the allegations were subsequently never addressed at length.</PARA>
<PARA>Jack Morris is still today managing director of Smorgon Consolidated Industries. It might be added that document H of the 1982 Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry headed by Mr Justice Woodward dealt with these allegations in some detail. Mr Justice Woodward commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters could only excite suspicion that the meatworks had something to hide.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, Smorgon Consolidated Industries, through its company Pacific Meat Supply Pty Ltd, was convicted under the Contravention of Secret Commissions Act in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 20 February 1986 and ordered to pay $4,000 into the court poor box, as shown on the relevant documentation. The charge was strangely changed from the original conspiracy to defraud, again as documented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the Federal Labor Government's steps to supposedly strengthen the fit and proper person requirements, I would like to know from the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) how the Smorgon Group, with its extraordinary record and associations over a long period, was able to take over the Angliss Group unchallenged.
