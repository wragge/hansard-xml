<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development agree with the view that to involve Australia in a GATT consistent free trade agreement with the United States would be `naive' and `primitive'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister, quite rightly, labels proposals to negotiate with NAFTA as naive, given that NAFTA legislation is not through the Congress, given that we do not know what is in NAFTA, and given that the details of NAFTA we have available do not do anything for us in respect of agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is naive; I have already said that. When you face the situation in bilateral negotiations, as I will again next Monday in Washington, and say to the Americans, `We have access to about 4 per cent of your beef market. We have access to a bit less than one per cent of your sugar market. We have access to a bit less than one per cent of your steel market. We have access to an almost negligible quantity of your dairy markets. We want to negotiate in these areas', they come back and whack you pretty heavily and say, `Yes, but we have only 50 per cent access to your telecommunications and broadcast market and, really, we want all this settled up first before we will do anything in other areas'. When you see NAFTA, which has nothing in it for agriculture, nothing in it for steel and nothing in it for the areas in which we have particular comparative advantage, it becomes rather silly and naive to think you can actually negotiate bilaterally with the United States to get a GATT consistent free trade arrangement when there is nothing in it for us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says that when the Prime Minister goes to Japan he should be talking about rice. We will always talk about rice. I was up there the week before last talking about rice. I am sure all agricultural Ministers in previous governments have talked about rice to the Japanese. But suddenly the Leader of the Opposition has discovered that the Japanese have massive barriers on rice&mdash;about 700 per cent. I simply point out that, if you think you can solve that one bilaterally, you have another think coming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has a $45 billion trade deficit with Japan. It provides the defence umbrella. Japan and America are each other's largest trading partners. With that massive trade imbalance, the United States cannot get anything out of the Japanese on rice. Even if it could, it would be blocked in the upper House in Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will raise it, and we will continue to raise it, but in many of these areas&mdash;for example, the areas of agriculture and natural resource products, where we have comparative advantage&mdash;it is best to continue on the multilateral path, because you will get these matters solved here and you will get a breakthrough there. Bilaterally, you can only get marginal gains. If you can get under the multilateral umbrella, you certainly will get a lot more bilateral access. The Prime Minister is right to say that the Leader of the Opposition was naive. He did not know what he was talking about, and he still does not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The APEC Ministerial Council last week committed itself to continue an agenda of trade liberalisation in the region. The communique had some quite interesting text on it. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers endorsed the view of the informal group that APEC economies should encourage investment linkages . . . and support the process of broader trade liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers discussed the practical measures identified by the informal group to carry forward the mandate from the Seoul meeting to identify options and make recommendations for approaches to trade liberalisation in the region.</PARA>
<PARA>It talks in these terms. This was another step on the way to further integrating Australia in the region, which has already brought us remarkable trade success as we now have exports running at about 25 per cent of GDP; where we have seen our manufacturing and service exports triple; and where we have seen elaborately transformed manufactures triple.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going to have targets for these countries where we have no control and require bureaucrats and the private industry of Australia to meet the targets. At the same time he has a precise target of withdrawing $70m from the trade budget and, while he slashes Austrade and splits the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the shadow trade Minister says, `We don't need an export development grant scheme or something like it'. In other words, those opposite would take away all of the mechanisms to increase trade, while at the same time adopting precise targets that were not mentioned in Fightback. But, of course, they are targets over which the Leader of the Opposition has no control. Yet, where he would have control, as a government, he has no targets for Australia or for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has no target for the Australian motor vehicle industry&mdash;it can sink or swim under zero tariffs; no target for the Australian sugar industry&mdash;it can sink or swim under zero tariffs; no target for textiles, clothing or footwear under zero tariffs; no target for Australian manufacturing employees; and no target for Australian farmers. But, all of a sudden, under his trade policy, where he is slippin' and slidin' on trade, he now has precise targets for markets. None of this is in his official text. This has been developed on the run over the weekend. Bureaucrats will be required to meet them and, presumably, the trade Minister's head will be lopped if the targets are not met. But he has no targets in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it true that, as reportedly stated by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy during his recent visit to Washington, the issue of a close Australian involvement with NAFTA was specifically raised by the Australian Government with President Bush and his team when they visited Canberra in January? Is it also true that the matter was subsequently addressed by Cabinet?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of a North American free trade agreement&mdash;the development of NAFTA&mdash;was precisely mentioned by me. I said that it was largely an insidious influence on world trade if it extended into South America. I made the points then to the President, and I made them in the public speech in the Great Hall, saying that we wanted the United States to have a foot in both oceans&mdash;in the Atlantic and the Pacific&mdash;and that actually slipping behind trade barriers in the Americas was basically not going to be a trade liberalising thing; that is, for Australia, which produces a lot of products similar to that which would be produced by Canada and Mexico, and particularly by countries of South America. I said that a free trade agreement must inevitably mean that exports from this country would be shut out. I told the President that, while there was a naturalness about Canadian and Mexican exports going to the United States&mdash;meaning that it was natural, therefore, that a free trade arrangement between the countries could be developed&mdash;there was nothing natural about Central America or South America.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made that quite clear. Therefore, that issue would mean that, if the United States is basically jockeyed into a position where it wants to respond to trade protectionism in Europe, this is basically against its best interests. The great preponderance of its trade is in the Pacific, not the Atlantic, although most of its investment is in the Atlantic. The President should enhance the role of APEC as a trade liberalising force so that we all enjoy higher incomes and greater levels of growth by seeing trade in agriculture, services, intellectual property rights and all of the things which are in the current GATT round, as we saw a pick-up in trade in goods following the Kennedy Round in the 1960s. That is what I urged upon the President. It was because of those urgings that he made it quite clear in his parliamentary speech in this chamber that the United States was not withdrawing from the Pacific, that it was going to engage the Pacific and that he wanted to consider those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this Government which proposed the establishment of APEC. Those opposite make these fraudulent claims that the Government has sat down on trade policy. But the very vehicle with which most of the countries of the Asia-Pacific area focus&mdash;that is, APEC&mdash;is the vehicle which was promoted by this Government. As we saw from this week's meeting and the transcript and the communique, APEC is continuing to develop. But the issue of Australia and NAFTA has been discussed over a very long period and has been rejected as a way forward by this Government. We made it quite clear that we were not going to fly over Asia to San Francisco. As I said the other day, the only place where you are comfortable is either Washington or London. If you are not being drawn to the old epicentres of influence&mdash;London or Washington&mdash;then you are basically lost.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="883" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. It is the case that the international competitiveness of Australian manufacturing industry has improved dramatically in the last 10 years. One only needs to look at some of the statistics which show that there has been an increase in labour productivity of something like 3 per cent per annum in manufacturing industry as a whole. If we look specifically at the car industry, we see that during the 1980s labour productivity has increased by about 3 per cent per annum, something which even the honourable member for Goldstein has reflected on admiringly, when he says that productivity growth has been between 6 and 12 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at export growth, we find that this has been nothing short of spectacular. Motor vehicle exports have grown 2 1/2 times to $1.3 billion. Interestingly, we have seen the quality of Australian cars improving as well from over four faults per car to something like two faults per car, well within the order of the quality of imported cars which we were not within cooee of a few years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the steel industry we have seen that labour  productivity has increased by well over 6 per cent every year during the 1980s, and that as a result BHP Steel has made investments and it has slashed the cost of making steel in this country. In the next day or two the Australian Manufacturing Council will reveal that something like 400 companies in Australia have seen their elaborately transformed exports growing by an almost unbelievable&mdash;to use their expression&mdash;rate of 60 per cent per annum. This has come about because of the sustained hard work of the manufacturing industry, improving their productivity and improving their quality. It has been the sustained hard work of management within that industry, working with unions, improving work practices, developing new products and seeking out new export markets. It has also been the result of sustained hard work on the part of this Government, providing the supporting mechanisms, providing things such as export facilitation and an industrial relations environment in which these changes can occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are some of the stars of Australian manufacturing industry that have been able to achieve these results? Amongst the long list, of course, would be John Prescott's BHP, Bob Johnston's Toyota, Mike Quinn's Mitsubishi, Dick Warburton's Du Pont, just to mention a few. These are people who have worked hard at trying to lift the quality of Australian manufacturing industry. These are the good managers in Australia. But I note that amongst the many things on which there is a huge gulf between us and the Opposition is this question about who are good managers in Australia. I reflect back to 1987 when the Leader of the Opposition wrote on this topic of good management in Australia. After spending the usual 90 per cent of his article denigrating Australian managers, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he saw a silver lining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there are signs that things may be changing. They indicate that a managerial revolution is under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This revolution has manifested itself in the emergence of a new breed of industrial managers. Names such as Skase, Bond, Elliott, Spalvins . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superior managerial skills of this new breed are readily apparent.</PARA>
<PARA>They may be readily apparent to him, but they are not so readily apparent to us. I do not know what Chris Skase has exported from Australia, except other people's money and backache; and, of course, John Elliott has managed to export 30 per cent of Fosters.</PARA>

The worrying factor is that he embraces each conviction with an absolute intensity along with the belief that many of those who do not support him are motivated by ill-will.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the view which is so concerning about the Leader of the Opposition and the way in which he has launched this assault on so many great Australians who have been doing such a lot for manufacturing industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, as a result of the work of these managers and their unions, manufacturing industry has transformed the success of Australian manufacturing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Leader of the Opposition says, `We need a new consumption tax; we need a big bang in industrial relations and we need zero tariffs'. But what should be ringing in the ears of the Leader of the Opposition is those powerful words of Mr O'Brien the other night when he said, `What if you're wrong, John?'. That is the question which members of the Opposition should be asking themselves constantly. What if the Leader of the Opposition is wrong? What will be left of these great companies?

What did he say in Washington in relation to Australia and NAFTA? Has Cabinet addressed this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="884" SPEAKER="Crean The Hon S.F." NAMEID="DT4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="HOTHAM" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not indicate to anyone whilst I was in Washington about Australia's possible accession to NAFTA, nor did I ask for that matter to be taken up by anyone with President Bush. It is true that when I was in the United States and I had discussions with my counterpart the Secretary of State for Agriculture, Secretary Madigan, I raised with him my concern about the possible implications of NAFTA to our sugar industry. I indicated in this House last week the response that I got in relation to that issue specifically having been raised; and that was that I was concerned&mdash;and this is one of the basic concerns that the Government has about joining NAFTA&mdash;that trade bloc agreements can become inward looking, not outward looking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the reason we were having concerns with the way that NAFTA was developing. It might have been all right if NAFTA had been building on the need for trade liberalisation. But, if NAFTA was resurrecting or constructing new barriers, it did not have much in it for us. The sugar industry was one particular area where this matter was taken up. As I say, I referred to this when I responded in the House the other day.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those discussions with Secretary Madigan, he indicated to me that when the details were known Australia's concerns would be alleviated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that I have been having is that, between the document that came out on 12 August, I think&mdash;which had no detail at all about the level of sugar tariff or the impact of the sugar implications of NAFTA&mdash;and the leaked document that has been available over the last couple of days, we have still been trying to clarify what that detail involves and to ensure that that detail, when it translates, adheres to the commitment that Secretary Madigan gave me. That is the very reason that we have it as a priority on the discussions with the US trade officials and Agriculture Department officials when they come here tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, after all, is what sensible bilateralism is about. It is not about running around trying to join something that we do not know the details of. It is about trying to get clarification as to how policy which is going to be implemented over there will apply to specific industries. The very fact that we cannot guarantee in advance how these things are going to apply is the reason why we need specific domestic policies which take those factors into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's approach is to join in some nonsensical commitment to NAFTA without knowing the details, and to try to join it after one side of the coalition&mdash;the National Party&mdash;has called America our number one trade enemy. How one expects to get any sense in negotiations from someone those opposite have insulted before one even sits around the negotiating table is a bit beyond me. But having put all their eggs in the basket of joining NAFTA on the back of an insult, Opposition members  would then proceed to decimate the sugar industry in this country by wiping out its tariff support and, in the process, try to pretend that there is no difference between Opposition policy on sugar and our policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that there is a gulf of difference. That gulf of difference is the reason why the sugar industry is spending more time talking to us about its future than it is spending talking to you. It is the reason why the statement by the Deputy Leader of the National Party,  who has asked me this question, that countervailing duties can protect the sugar industry was dismissed so rapidly by the Cane Growers Association. It is of course a stupid suggestion and the Association knows it,  but it is all those opposite can offer. They offer them the chance to join NAFTA when they do not even know how the thing will apply to us; they insult them in the process and then believe that countervailing duties will protect the sugar industry. Well, they will not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition policy so far as the sugar industry is concerned is vacuous. It reflects the same approach to industry policy that has been demonstrated not only by the National Party but also particularly by honourable members who claim to speak for industry on that side of the Parliament. It is policy run by anecdote and backward-looking visions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an amazing circumstance last week when the honourable member for Barker, confronted in his party room and asked how he developed the approach in terms of industry policy in relation to the car industry, said, `Well, when I got in the car and turned on the ignition, the gear wouldn't work'. That is the way that side of the House approaches policy. Similarly, when he was asked to tell people how regional development would react to changes in industries such as the sugar industry when tariff was cut away from them, the honourable member said, `Go and have a look at what happened when the corn laws were introduced in England in the nineteenth century'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There you have it. It is industry policy run by anecdote, by the past and by this view that all one has to do is dispense the medicine without any regard to the consequences. It is little wonder that people are turning away from those opposite in droves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will protect the interests of the sugar industry. We will do it by having a sensible trade policy, one that is multilateral in dimension, but with a strong bilateral focus. But most important of all, we will develop a growth strategy for the sugar industry with the sugar industry and in which we will recognise a legitimate role for government&mdash;not one in which government vacates it and leaves the industry to the corrupted world market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to be able to inform the House that a national system of road user charges for heavy vehicles proposed by the National Road Transport Commission has now been accepted by the Council of State and Federal Transport Ministers. I might add that this is a great win for cooperative government; it is a great win for doing things by consensus and rational discussion; and it is a great win for all of us because the Australian economy is very heavily dependent on an efficient road transport industry.

It designates 18c a litre fuel excise as a road user charge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things which the Opposition should realise is that trade matters between Australia and the Americans have always been a huge priority for this Government. There have been important reasons for that. One is that the Australian Government, and, indeed, the Cairns Group, has had no fiercer supporter in its endeavours to improve world trade in agriculture than the American Government, now and over the years just passed. So, of course, we discuss with the Americans how we can improve the global environment for world trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Opposition is now trying to make a big point. The point I was making a few days ago was that for months the Opposition Leader has been flaying around, not knowing whether he was in favour of multilateral trade, as he said at the summer school in Perth earlier this year. He said then that anyone who talks about bilateralism in trade is having himself on, or words to that effect, and that we should not deviate at all from our concentration on the importance of the GATT. That is what he was saying just in January of this year. Now he wants to talk about bilateralism but he wants to talk about bilateralism at the same time as he talks about zero tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of bilateralism is that we trade off access between two markets. That is the basic ingredient of bilateralism: we give one country a concession in return for our getting a concession in that country's market. But what concession can you give if you have set zero tariffs for everyone and if you have said, `Our market in Australia will be open to everyone for anything'? What concessions can you give and what kind of negotiating position would you be in if you went to the Americans, the Mexicans, the Canadians, the Chileans or anyone you like to mention and said, `We want to do a deal with you but of course you won't have any better access to our market than anyone else because we have zero tariffs for everyone on everything'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you started it, but we have accelerated it. The point about trade agreements is that what they do in the first instance is simply to formalise existing trade patterns. The reason why NAFTA developed was that Canada's trade, the United States's trade and Mexico's trade were predominantly with each other; that is, they were each other's major trading partners. But the pattern of trade has been changing for Australia in recent times. Australian exports going to NAFTA are just 12 per cent and falling. Our trade going to Asia is 44 per cent and rising. So the whole point is that in the period that we have been talking about in the last few years, ASEAN has actually eclipsed the United States in terms of being an important trading partner. In other words, ASEAN is now about our second or third most important trading partner; hence the absolute importance of our looking to Asia, and not proceeding as the Opposition Leader would do to join some irrelevant North American club.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most remarkable things about the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is that when he is under pressure in Question Time he cuts off Question Time as quickly as he can. Today we had four questions from the Opposition. When we exposed the hypocrisy of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on the trade issue, suddenly the Prime Minister wanted to cut it off&mdash;just as he would not debate the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) last Thursday, and just as he cut off Question Time last Tuesday, at the beginning of the fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a man, by the way, whose great political hero is none other than Winston Churchill. He says to the unsuspecting Australian public that the reason he admires Winston Churchill is that Winston Churchill showed a great sense of leadership and destiny at a time of his nation's greatest national crisis. The irony of the Prime Minister's view is that we as a country face today one of our greatest national crises&mdash;certainly our second greatest national economic crisis since 1788. But we do not have a Prime Minister who is prepared to address and analyse the problems of the country, to commit this country to practical solutions and to have the courage to tell Australians what solutions will really work in their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in stark contrast to the Leader of the Opposition who, for whatever else the Labor Party may say about him, is a man who does not lack political courage and who, as the Treasurer himself said the other day, believes what he says and says what he believes. That is something that we on this side of the House are proud of. The fact that the Labor Party thinks it is a point of criticism says more about it than it does about the substance of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, led by the Prime Minister, has done precisely the reverse. Government members have looked at the problems we have as a country and they have analysed those problems. They know about the exploding foreign debt that we have; about the one million people who are out of work in Australia; and about the recurrent month by month massive balance of payments deficits. They know that those problems can be resolved only by making this country more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But have a look at the Government's record in decision-making. Does it reflect the knowledge of the problems and an objective analysis of the solution to those problems? The fact is that after 10 years in office&mdash;not 10 days or 3 years&mdash;all Government members are doing is playing politics. They are inventing arguments to suit the convenience of the day, which bear no relationship at all to the fundamental problems that this country has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through some examples of how the Labor Party&mdash;and in particular the Prime Minister&mdash;has been doing this. I have noticed that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, in particular, like to make the point that the Leader of the Opposition apparently abuses business. Let us reflect on that. Do the Treasurer and the Prime Minister ever abuse the business community? The answer is that they sure do. Many members of the Opposition will remember the remarks the now Prime Minister made about Nobby Clark and the National Australia Bank, and how the National Australia Bank was broke. The Prime Minister said that, if it had not been for him, that would have been the end of it. There has been constant criticism of business people. On 23 November 1989 the now Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean if there is any slothfulness in Australian policy or Australian commerce, it is not on the part of the Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it's on the part of business.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that many Australian business people:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wouldn't get going in a barrel of yeast. . . a great problem Australia has is basically its management structure and particularly its middle management.</PARA>
<PARA>So every single day we have abuse across the chamber about how we criticise certain business leaders, but the Government has attacked the whole of the business community. The person who did it was, of course, the notorious Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the great issue of the day&mdash;the tariff issue. Let us look at what the Prime Minister has said about tariffs. He is running around Australia giving the impression that the only way our economy can be saved is by high levels of protection. He is beating up every protectionist sentiment in this country for cheap political advantage. Yet we all know that he knows that one of the things we have to be prepared to face up to as a country is reducing tariff protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a matter of credit to this Parliament&mdash;not much is&mdash;that over the last decade or so it has supported a process of lower levels of tariff protection. If it had not been for the support of this side of politics in that process, it would never have been achieved. It would have been simply unachievable. The Prime Minister is running around and trying to beat up protectionist sentiment, set himself up as the champion of protectionism. In order to do what&mdash;win an intellectual point? No, in order to rake in a few cheap votes. That really is cheap politics of the worst kind. On 9 April 1991 in this House, the then Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are the only party that has removed the tariff wall&mdash;in 1988 and more recently in the Prime Minister's speech&mdash;to see it go to 5 per cent, to see it abolished, and to see a free flow of goods as well as a free flow of funds in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 12 March this year, the present Prime Minister said:</PARA>

I would have thought that it was the patriotic duty of this Parliament to try to get better access to other markets. Oh no, this is shock, horror, terribly naive and terribly dangerous. But as we were reminded in Question Time, the Treasurer, not five or 10 years ago, but on 4 September 1991 at the Northbridge Taxation Office doorstep&mdash;I think a plaque should be erected there; a plaque should be put on the doorstep&mdash;said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the issue of payroll tax. Now the Prime Minister says that it is impossible to abolish payroll tax and all these sorts of things; he is not in favour of payroll tax. In fact, the present Prime Minister is the champion of the payroll tax system, as I love to tell my constituents. But back in 1977 he said to the Fraser Government that we should abolish payroll tax and that that would create 200,000 jobs. Was that what he believed then? Does he believe that today? We would not know. He will believe today what suits him politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I finish on the issue of the GST. I want to read to honourable members two quotes that I hope they and the Australian public will reflect on. One of them was in a speech to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> taxation symposium on 7 June 1985 when the now Prime Minister was arguing in support of a broadly based consumption tax. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must all recognise that it would be all too easy in this debate to inflame fears and prejudice. And we should realise that some people will be trying to do just this&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>What humbug! What a frightful lot of humbug we get from him today! What a fraud! Yes, if ever there was a fraud in this Parliament it is the present Prime Minister. There were all those arguments he used to repeat in support of a broadly based consumption tax: `Allow a more rational indirect tax system; generate tax revenues to allow for a reduction in marginal rates of income tax; get rid of the black economy'&mdash;that was one of his big arguments&mdash;`there should be virtually zero exemptions; a single rate tax structure. That is a crucial design feature, to assist both administration and compliance: for business this is a simple tax'. Ho hum&mdash;the man who admires Churchill!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech that we have just heard from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) had as its premise an absolutely false proposition, as those opposite all know: that this Government has not been about fundamental change to the Australian economy to make it much more internationally competitive&mdash;the fundamental objective that a government should have if it is going to tackle the needs of the economy at the present time. His premise is that this Government has not been doing it. That premise is absolutely untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that no government in the history of this nation has tackled the need for this country to become internationally competitive in the way that this Government has done. No government has come anywhere near that, let alone its predecessors, the Fraser Government or the other conservative governments that ran this country from 1949 to 1982, except for three years. Those governments made the Australian economy what it was at the beginning of the 1980s: entirely unable to develop a sophisticated array of manufactured exports or service exports; entirely unable to be internationally competitive; dependent on its rural and mineral products for exports; and therefore not able to continue to maintain the growth in living standards which the people of Australia had become used to through the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reality of what the previous conservative governments delivered to the Australian people at the beginning of the 1980s. This Government has spent 10 years addressing the shortcomings of that period and has brought about enormous change in the process. Certainly, in making those changes, there has been an evolution in the Government's thinking in various respects. We are doing some things now that we would not have said we would do at the beginning of our period in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the Government's thinking changed, but there has been an evolution in the thinking of the parties involved and a greater understanding of various policy propositions, which has led us to the point where we are now, I believe, pursuing policies which are absolutely dedicated to continuing the thrust of greater international competitiveness. No government has done more to bring this about than this Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been in the driving seat of all of those changes, as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, and he certainly deserves enormous credit from the Australian nation for the changes that he has been prepared to face up to and introduce in this country, rather than be castigated by the juvenile, schoolboy debating tactics of the honourable member for Mayo, who cannot even stand the heat and has now left the kitchen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this Government has brought about that enormous change. Let me just give an example of that and look at enterprise bargaining and wages. The wages system in this country has evolved during our period in office and we are now pursuing enterprise bargaining very successfully. Is the Opposition against that? Is the Opposition crook on us for adopting enterprise bargaining? Those opposite say this Government has not gone far enough. One of the great ironies is that it was the conservatives who brought about the non-competitive Australian economy, and now they attack us for not moving faster to undo the non-competitive economy which they produced over 30 years. They say we should be moving faster to undo their previous policies. When we have introduced programs such as enterprise bargaining we are attacked for not doing it fast enough. As in many other cases, the fact is that this Government is pursuing enterprise bargaining, tariff reduction, the liberalisation of aviation and so on in a very substantial and measured way, which is as fast as it can without creating substantial problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fundamental tenet of the Opposition's approach to economic policy in this country is absolute extremism; right wing extremism and right over-the-top&mdash;completely over-the-top&mdash;policies. It has been the hallmark of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), as Leader of the Opposition, that that has been the way in which the Opposition's policies have evolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at enterprise bargaining. It is not just a matter of accepting enterprising bargaining which we introduced, and which is now developing at a rapid rate, and in a very satisfactory way, with increased productivity and with major change in our workplaces. It is happening well because of all the preconditioning that occurred with the change in attitudes of the parties over the previous decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition wants to go much further than that. It wants to break away the safety nets of award conditions which would open workers to exploitation where they did not have strong bargaining power. It is a typical example of the Opposition's right over-the-top, extremist approach. This is an ultra right wing approach to economic policy, and one which would do great harm to Australians and to the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at tariffs. The Opposition would adopt a policy of taking tariffs to zero, or near to it, by the year 2000 in the car, and textiles, clothing and footwear industries, knowing that the result would not be the strengthening of the industry by making it more efficient, but the demolition of the industry. The Opposition does not care about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It knows that investors are saying, `We will not invest, if that is the policy'. It knows that investors have investments on hold now because they think that the Opposition might win an election. It is doing great damage to the Australian economy and to the recovery process. Nevertheless, it is pursuing an ultra, over-the-top, extremist policy. The policy is damaging even now from opposition. If it were to get into government, the policy would be devastating in its impact on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to aviation, the Opposition has a policy of open skies. We have had tremendous change in aviation. There have been increased numbers of international operators coming into this country, and the number of passengers coming into this country has doubled in our period in office. That has been brought about by great liberalisation through the bilateral agreements, which give much greater access to foreign operators to come into Australia. This has resulted in many more operators and many more services by those operators. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what does the Opposition want to do? It is not satisfied with going down that kind of path. It wants to go right over the top and have an open skies policy. What is an open skies policy? It is a policy where there are no bilateral agreement restrictions. One simply says: anyone who wants to come to Australia can, and can fly his plane here and wipe out our aviation industry&mdash;certainly in its international aspects. That is the open skies policy in Fightback which the Opposition pursues. It is another typical example of being right over the top, massively over the top, in the way in which it seeks to approach the solutions to the Australian economy. It is deplorable that the Opposition has such extreme policies and they certainly are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to taxation, and Fightback, and all of the associated arrangements with that, there are a whole panoply of over-the-top policies, including a very large goods and services tax at 15 per cent. This would put inflation into the economy of at least 5 per cent, when the other taxes are taken off. In the process, this would undo one of the great achievements of recent times, which has been to get inflation down to very low levels&mdash;below the levels of our major trading partners. That is an enormous structural change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions are committed to saying, `We will pursue wages policies which will keep us in that position, where we will have inflation at no more than that of our major trading partners'. Australia has never been, for a concerted period in its history, able to have inflation continuously at competitive levels. If we are able to achieve that now, and go ahead with growth on that basis, that is a fantastic structural change, and one which will be of enormous benefit to our manufacturers and exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what would the Opposition do? It would drop a 5 per cent inflation effect, at least, on that through the goods and services tax. This would totally blow apart the arrangements in relation to wages, lead us to countervailing wages claims for compensation, and take us back into the high inflation mould. That is what its policies are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it will all just pass through in a year, but it knows that is not going to be the case unless it really grinds the economy into the ground by exceedingly stringent fiscal and monetary policies. That is what it would do. It would have to if it were going to stop inflation becoming endemic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have typical examples of the Opposition's absurdly over-the-top policies. The honourable member for Mayo attacks us for engaging in privatisation. Privatisation is something which this Government has pursued to a certain degree. It believes it has done so in a measured and sensible way and one which will bring about substantial benefits in terms of increased efficiency in some of those industries and certainly a return to the Budget. But the Opposition wants to go right over the top and privatise just about everything in sight. In the process of doing that, it would be likely to cause substantial damage to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental tenet of the proposition of the honourable member for Mayo is therefore utterly untrue. It is simply untrue to say that this Government has not been able to address the fundamental issues. It has addressed those fundamental issues in an extraordinarily diligent way since the time it came to office. If one looks at what is happening now in the Australian economy one can see the fruits of that approach beginning to arrive. One can see it in things such as the growth in manufacturing exports. There has been enormous growth in manufacturing exports. Why? It is because people are able to be competitive. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite say that they would produce great benefits for business by taking $20 billion in taxes off business. This is one of the great, absurd arguments of all time. They are saying, `We'll take off payroll tax, the wholesale sales tax and the fuel tax&mdash;that's $20 billion in taxes off business&mdash;and therefore business will be free to grow and there will be a tremendous burst of economic activity'. I have never heard such nonsense in my life. They are totally ignoring the $27 billion in taxes that they would impose through the goods and services tax. Those opposite take $20 billion off business inputs and put $27 billion in tax on business outputs. The consumer pays either way.

But those opposite are not proposing that; they are proposing a much bigger tax on wages. Through the goods and services tax, they are proposing a $27 billion tax on value added. What is value added? Value added is wages and profits&mdash;overwhelmingly it is wages. Those opposite are proposing an estimated $27 billion tax on wages. They will take off a $6 billion tax, put on a $20 billion tax and then say, `Haven't we had a tremendous reduction in taxes on wages and won't a million flowers bloom in the form of increased jobs?'.

But when the Opposition wants to take them from 36 per cent down to 5 per cent nominal, which is probably 10 or 15 per cent when grossed up to the effective rate, and we want to knock another 20 percentage points off that, all of a sudden that is somehow disastrous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance really reflects the way the debate has gone in this Parliament over the last week and the absolute disarray of the Opposition on a series of issues relating to tariffs, its general policy perspective as far as the economy is concerned and fundamentally the total inflexibility of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to address the issues that areas of business and the broader areas of the community are concerned about in order to ensure that we get economic recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we got from the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was a diatribe of abuse directed at the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). There was no substance and no structure to what they propose as far as their policies are concerned. There was no attempt to answer the fact that industries around the country, particularly industries such as the motor vehicle industry and the sugar industry, are telling those opposite that their policies will not work, that their policies will decimate those industries and that there will not be investment at the Mitsubishi plant in Australia if the Leader of the Opposition proceeds with his mad experiment of the zero tariff approach and the other things that are part of his agenda. All of those things that come forward from various segments of the community to suggest to the Opposition, `At least think again; have dialogue and discussions before proceeding with that sort of structure' have met with derision and abuse&mdash;the sort of abuse and the sorts of comments that we got from the honourable member for Parkes and his colleagues when he was speaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing can dispute the fact that, for instance, the executives of many of the motor vehicle companies have said that the Opposition's policies just will not produce investment. If the Opposition wants to have its way and say that the motor vehicle industry is an optional extra for Australia, that the workers in that industry do not matter, that the industry does not matter and that the exports that have been generated through the motor vehicle component industry do not matter, that is fine. Let those opposite have that policy; but let the people of Australia understand what the net effect of that policy would be and contrast that with the Government, which is dealing with a very deep recession and creating the economic recovery that is necessary, but at the same time is recognising that we have a part to play in the world and that the best way for us to achieve that is to get a combination of national and international perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in his contribution that, when we get this sort of spurious MPI that we have had from the Opposition, we are entitled to ask: what about wages policy? Does wages policy matter? Of course it matters; yet the Opposition suggests that having a meaningful wages policy, a dialogue with the trade union movement, also is an optional extra. It wants to decimate the trade union movement of Australia and it is prepared to go along with that as part of this phoney experiment that it wants to place upon the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at the questions relating to employment and industrial relations, we then turn to the questions relating to overall economic conditions. We have been through a period of very difficult economic times in Australia. But we are not unique; that has been the case around the world. We have a chance in Australia because we now have a low inflation setting; we now have inflation at the lowest level in 20 years. We have the lowest interest rate setting in 20 years and manufactured exports at the highest level for many years&mdash;in record terms in fact. The fact that we have those ingredients should be the basis for new investment to occur, for real sustainable recovery to occur and for jobs to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not just relied on having those conditions right. The Prime Minister and the Government recognised that, as well as those preconditions for recovery, there was an important need for government to reflect the continuing stimulus in the economy and create circumstances for growth by a fiscal stimulus, as occurred through the Budget, the One Nation statement and the youth jobs statement in July. All of those things are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's alternative to having that sort of fiscal stimulus is to say, `We'd like to take $7 billion out of Commonwealth outlays'&mdash;to hit the very people who need assistance in these difficult times. The Opposition is quite happy to have the unemployed tossed out on the street after nine months. It is quite happy to have a situation in which people who need to provide for themselves&mdash;for example, accommodation for the aged&mdash;elect to have an extra 15 per cent lumped onto those sorts of services. That is okay; in the view of the Opposition it does not matter about those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there does need to be a balance of policy. There does need to be a recognition that we cannot have this extreme right wing ideology lumped on the people of Australia come what may: `It does not matter what happens, we can have this experiment thrust on the people of Australia'. Adopting the Hewson experiment would be a disaster for Australia. It would put an end to those lights of economic recovery that are starting to shine. Putting the Leader of the Opposition in charge of economic policy in Australia would be the equivalent of putting Guy Fawkes in charge of an explosives factory. That is an experiment I do not believe the people of Australia would want. I am sure that, as time goes on, the people of Australia, particularly those in the motor vehicle and sugar industries, will start to speak up and make it known that they are not prepared to be wiped out; that they are not prepared to let the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues loose on this sort of setting for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that in the last week we have seen some people starting to get out of the Opposition Leader's cart. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) and the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) are starting to raise serious questions because they have manufacturing industry in their States and areas. They are saying, `We're not too sure that this manic desire of the Leader of the Opposition to wipe out the motor vehicle industry is such a good idea. We're prepared to speak up and say this might not be the best way to go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are entitled to speak up. Indeed, they have a responsibility to speak up so that the people of Australia understand that it is no good just branding the leaders of our motor vehicle industries as liars, as the Leader of the Opposition has been prone to do. It is one thing to denigrate the people in the Parliament&mdash;the Prime Minister and the Ministers&mdash;but we get the spectacle of continual denigration of those outside the Parliament who disagree with the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank is constantly under attack. Renters are under attack; they have committed some sort of heinous crime. The Greens are constantly under attack. All of the people who happen to question some policies of the Leader of the Opposition are subject to the sort of abuse that we have witnessed today from the honourable member for Mayo. The truth is that those people have a legitimate point to make as well. They are entitled to have their views heard. We are entitled to ensure that, in the development of national policy by the Government or the Opposition, some regard is paid to the interests of Australians in the broader context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the unique spectacle of the Leader of the Opposition, as part of this process, having reached the stage of engaging in international insults. Over the weekend, both the United States and Japan&mdash;Japan, our largest trading partner, with which we have a tremendous trade surplus&mdash;have been forced to come to the unique position of attack in response to the Leader of the Opposition's comments. Japan is saying, `Some of the comments of the shadow Minister for trade are a bit far-fetched'. As Greg Sheridan said in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You've got to hand it to the Opposition. They've pulled off an amazing quinella.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to understand the psychology and politics of this. It is an extraordinary event.</PARA>
<PARA>Much of what has been going on in recent times with the Leader of the Opposition is an extraordinary event. The more the pressure is put on the Opposition to explain how it is going to deal with the effects of its policies and the more it is asked to explain the impact of what its policies will be, the more amazing it becomes, the more abuse we get, the more strange the circumstances and behaviour, and the more dramatic are the Opposition's announcements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the extraordinary turn in circumstances of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the trade issue. How did we get some sort of ordered policy in the Opposition Leader's trade policies? There was not any order; there was not any coherence. It really was policy on the run. What did we get when he went to North Queensland? He said, `I've got to do something to get this sugar industry off my back. I've got to find some way of getting the sugar industry not to focus on what we are planning to do with our zero tariffs on sugar. We've got to try to do something about it'. What did he do? He dreamt up this notion: `We'll get in and attack our trading partners. That'll be the best way of getting us off the hook'. As we have seen, it has not got him off the hook. In relation to trade and the broader economic issues, the Government has, rightly, focused the attack on the Opposition and where its policies will affect Australia very severely and adversely, as they will in the sugar and motor vehicle industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good saying now that our policies are really just the same. We know the policies are not the same. We know that fundamentally there is a gulf between the policies of the two sides. Zero does not equal 15; it does not equal 25. What really matters is that we do have a car plan; we do have a commitment to Australian industry; and we do have a commitment to economic recovery and economic growth. The Government's strategy all through this process, led by the Prime Minister, has been to achieve that objective. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I am pleased to present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations regarding its inquiry into refugee and humanitarian visas and permits. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System:  Achieving a Balance Between Refuge and Control</EMPHASIS>. It focuses on all issues concerning onshore asylum seekers&mdash;that is, those persons who seek asylum at Australia's borders&mdash;and persons who are temporary residents or illegal entrants in Australia and who seek asylum from within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the most comprehensive assessment of the onshore refugee situation yet undertaken in Australia by any public body. During the inquiry the Committee received a large number of submissions and took a considerable amount of public evidence at hearings over a two-year period. The Committee's inquiry and this report have come at a critical time. Today the world is faced with a refugee crisis of proportions not seen since the Second World War. Australia, like many other countries around the world, is faced with an increasing number of asylum seekers applying for refugee status, either at the border or once they have entered the country. It is estimated that currently there are approximately 17.5 million refugees worldwide. With the continuing crisis in the former Yugoslavia, this number is expected to increase in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent visit which I undertook to several European nations, I was able to witness first-hand the extreme difficulties which many countries are facing as a result of the refugee crisis. I held discussions with officials from countries such as Germany, which are bearing the major refugee burden. I also witnessed the trauma and suffering of the refugees themselves, and was told continually of the need for a solution to this crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deal with this growing problem, Australia and other major countries of resettlement, such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, have been reviewing and amending their refugee laws and processing arrangements. My Committee's inquiry has been an important part of that review process. With countries around the world looking to each other for solutions to their own refugee difficulties, my Committee's report takes on a significant international dimension. The recommendations in this report will be compared with and assessed against the proposals which other countries are bringing to the refugee debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report the Committee has sought to achieve a balance between the best humanitarian outcome for asylum seekers, while ensuring that Australia maintains control over its refugee programs and systems. During the inquiry the Committee had to come to terms with a number of changes to Australia's onshore refugee and humanitarian system implemented by the Government. A number of these changes reflect the evidence received by the Committee. Through these changes, the Government has sought to address the deficiencies in the existing processing arrangements which were identified in the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the evidence to the inquiry supported the establishment of a simpler and speedier processing system for onshore asylum seekers. There was a strong view that lengthy delays in processing not only disadvantage genuine refugees by prolonging uncertainty in their lives, but also provide an incentive for those who do not have legitimate refugee claims to lodge an asylum application as a mechanism for prolonging their stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, the Committee has noted the recent changes which have been implemented and announced in relation to both the primary refugee decision-making process and the review procedures. At the primary stage, the changes include priority processing of border claimants and detained illegal entrants, time limits on lodgment of applications, and greater emphasis on case officers obtaining information at interview. These measures accord with the Committee's view that the Government should seize the initiative and control refugee determinations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the review stage, the changes include the recently announced replacement of the Refugee Status Review Committee with a new and independent Refugee Review Tribunal in 1993. The Committee anticipates that the RRT should be demonstrably fairer, should allow for a more accurate assessment of the merits of a claim, and should be faster and less costly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee, though, was concerned to ensure that there would be consistency in decision making between the various members appointed to the Tribunal. For this reason, it has recommended the appointment of a senior member to the RRT, who would be responsible for allocating work to Tribunal members to ensure development and enhancement of country expertise, and who would be empowered to establish three-member Tribunal panels to consider model case types for persuasive authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry one notable criticism of the existing decision-making process was that the information available to the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs regarding events and circumstances in particular countries was incomplete and out of date. The Department itself admitted in evidence to the Committee that the data available to it is limited, as its documentation centre is still in its formative stages. To rectify this problem, the Committee has made a series of recommendations aimed at improving the information which is available to both the Department and the review body, and which is used as the basis for their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the Committee has recommended that the Department establish and maintain a current and comprehensive database relating to every country in the existing refugee case load for use by departmental officers and the Refugee Review Tribunal. In addition, refugee applicants should be able to request and obtain all publicly available information which is used by the Department or the Tribunal in making their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also gave consideration to the existing procedures for granting entry on humanitarian grounds. In the report the Committee has endorsed the principle of providing short term extensions of stay to particular ethnic or nationality groups in humanitarian need. Recent examples of this policy include the concessionary arrangements applied to the nationals of Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf conflict, and to nationals of the former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Committee's view, such a policy allows the Government to respond appropriately by providing protection to classes in need, while ensuring that such protection is given for the term of the conflict or disaster which is the basis of the need and not beyond it. To this effect, the Committee has recommended that short term extensions of temporary stay should not only be given to individuals in a class or group affected by civil disorder, but also should be considered for individuals in groups whose homes or livelihoods have been affected by a major natural disaster. The area affected by the civil disorder or natural disaster could be either a nation state or part of a nation state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the temporary extension of stay is given to those who actually need it, the Committee has recommended that, where repeated extensions of stay in excess of one year have been given, before any further permit is granted, the applicants should be expected to show not only that they are citizens of the country affected by the civil strife or natural disaster, but additionally that their homes, livelihood and families are in areas affected or that they would be required to return to the area affected if returned home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the general on-shore humanitarian program, the Committee considered the existing procedures for humanitarian entry under which the refugee and humanitarian streams are combined into one process. The Committee was firmly of the view that the refugee and humanitarian streams should not be separated because of previous problems relating to duplicitous applications. However, it has recommended that to assist future decision making in this regard, monitoring of the existing refugee case load is required to determine which cases are more appropriately humanitarian claims rather than refugee claims. The Committee also has recommended that the new Refugee Review Tribunal be empowered to recommend to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) that, in deserving cases which do not meet the requirements for grant of refugee status, the Minister grant stay on humanitarian grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more contentious issues during the inquiry related to Australia's procedures for processing persons who claim asylum at Australia's borders. This includes boat arrivals who under existing requirements are held in detention until their applications for asylum are processed. In particular, the Committee heard considerable criticism about the lengthy detention to which recent boat arrivals have been subjected. In a number of cases, persons have been held in detention for over two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various explanations were given to the Committee for this lengthy detention, particularly of the Cambodian boat arrivals. While some have criticised the processing procedures of the Department, others have been critical of the time taken by lawyers to lodge refugee applications for these people. The Committee is firmly of the view that, regardless of where the blame should be apportioned, the detention of these boat arrivals has lasted far too long. It is imperative that the procedures which are in place do not allow a repetition of such lengthy detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard the Committee has noted the recent initiatives of the Government aimed at achieving a more efficient and expeditious determination system for border claimants, including the adoption of processing target dates. As recommended in an interim letter of advice which the Committee provided to the Minister in July 1991, the Committee also has noted the amendments to the Migration Act in May this year, which set out the intentions of the Parliament that undocumented boat arrivals should be held in detention until their status is determined but that such detention should not extend beyond a designated timeframe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this latest legislation, the Committee is of the view that even though it was introduced as an interim measure it has added to the complexity of the border arrangements. There is now a confusing array of provisions focused not so much on the status of the person as on his mode of arrival in Australia. There is a variety of terms now used to describe border claimants. In response, the Committee has recommended that the provisions in the Migration Act relating to border claimants be rewritten in a simplified and comprehensible manner, using as far as possible a single descriptive term for border claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for existing detention arrangements, the Committee has recommended that, given the new expeditious processing procedures for border claimants, the Government retain the policy of holding border claimants in detention until such time as their applications can be processed. Priority, though, must be directed to the expeditious processing of border claimants, with adequate resources to be directed to the Department to ensure that the processing targets are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also has recommended that the detention facility at Port Hedland be maintained. While the Committee heard various criticisms about the Port Hedland facility&mdash;particularly about its remote location&mdash;the Committee found that the facility has proved useful in ensuring improved access to detainees and improved opportunities for obtaining information relevant to their claims. In particular, the Committee took note of evidence from one group of lawyers working at Port Hedland that the isolation of the facility enables those lawyers who are assisting border claimants to focus on the task of preparing applicants' claims without the usual daily distractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the role of lawyers in the refugee processing system, the Committee has recommended that public funding be available for the provision of legal assistance to border claimants in relation to the preparation of primary applications for refugee status. However, the Committee felt that public funding should not be available for pursuing unmeritorious claims through every avenue of appeal. Accordingly, it has recommended that publicly funded legal assistance to refugee claimants seeking review of a refusal decision be provided via the Legal Aid Commission, based on the merits of that particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also considered the issue of permanent residence for refugee applicants. In the past, Australia granted refugees immediate resident status. However, this policy was modified in June 1990, when new regulations were introduced which gave refugees four years temporary stay, with the option of obtaining permanent residence at the end of the four years, subject to the availability of places in the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While endorsing the general principle of granting four-year temporary stay to refugees, the Committee was concerned about the inflexibility of this arrangement. In the Committee's view, there are some refugees, notably torture and trauma victims, who ought not to be required to wait out their full four-year temporary permit if places in the refugee program are immediately available or become available at some earlier time within the four years. Recommendations to this effect are contained in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the final chapter of the report, dealing with citizens of the People's Republic of China. This issue was the subject of much debate during the inquiry and within the Committee itself. In particular, considerable attention was focused on the position of PRC nationals who had arrived in Australia prior to the incident in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, and the Government's decision to grant such persons four year temporary entry permits. Debate within the Committee was directed especially to the undertaking given by then Prime Minister Hawke that no PRC national in Australia before 20 June 1989 would be forced to return to China against his will. This undertaking was reaffirmed in April 1992 by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee concluded that while recent policy in relation to PRC citizens has been aimed at providing a humanitarian response to persons, particularly students, affected by the unrest in China, it has contributed significantly to the immense burden which has been placed on Australia's refugee determination system over the past three years. It has also led to a great deal of uncertainty among PRC nationals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considered that there are difficulties in granting permanent residence to pre-Tiananmen Chinese as a class. It also considered that there are problems if all such PRC citizens are rejected for permanent residence when their temporary entry permits expire in June 1994. Such a move would raise the alarming possibility of the refugee determination system being clogged with some 10,000 PRC citizens when their temporary entry permits expire in June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In searching for a solution to this problem, the Committee came to a consensus agreement that Australia, as a nation, must stand by the word of its Prime Minister, and should honour the spirit of the commitment which was made to those PRC nationals. However, there was disagreement in the Committee as to what constitutes a solution to the PRC dilemma within the spirit of the Prime Minister's commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this question, I, as Chairman, differ from the majority view of the Committee. The majority has recommended that the Government should end the uncertainty concerning the long term future of PRC permit holders in Australia by announcing the arrangements which will be used to differentiate between those who from June 1994 will be granted permanent residence, those who may be granted a further four-year temporary entry permit, and those who will be returned to the PRC. The majority has recommended that from June 1994 PRC permit holders should be able to apply either for permanent residence, on the basis of already existing criteria for change of status, or for continuing protection, on a case by case basis against internationally accepted refugee criteria. The majority, though, has gone on to recommend that those who do not meet these selection criteria should be granted, on expiry of their permits, a short extension of stay, say three months, to put their affairs in order and make appropriate arrangements for departing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the recommendations of the majority clearly contradict the spirit of the Prime Minister's commitment that no PRC permit holder will be returned to China against his will. The recommendations, if adopted, probably would result in the vast majority of PRC permit holders being required to return to China after June 1994. I cannot support such a drastic solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, I have recommended that all PRC permit holders be eligible to apply for permanent residence provided that they satisfy certain criteria, and that all applications be considered on a case by case basis as to whether they satisfy the criteria for a specially designed PRC permanent entry permit. I have recommended that all applicants must show, in order to qualify, that they have strong humanitarian grounds, such as the possibility of facing severe discrimination or detention on return, and/or that they have appropriate connections with Australia, that they have been making a worthwhile contribution to Australia, and that they satisfy public interest criteria. Those applicants who do satisfy these criteria should be given permanent residence, while the remainder should continue to be given temporary entry permits until such time as they thought it safe to return to China. My strongest recommendation is that at no stage should they be forced to return against their will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My recommendations are similar to those in the other minority report on this issue by Senator Barney Cooney, who suggests that two categories should be available for this group of PRC nationals at the end of June 1994. Under Senator Cooney's proposals the first category is to give them permanent residence, while the second is to continue the temporary entry status they now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the differences in the Committee on the PRC issue, it is important to note that all other recommendations in this report have been endorsed unanimously by the Committee. To achieve this result, a great deal of hard work has been undertaken by Committee members. I wish to express my appreciation to my fellow Committee members for their assistance during this long and difficult inquiry. Special thanks also go to the Committee's legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, the current Committee Secretary, Mr Andres Lomp, the previous Secretary, Ms Robina Mills, and Secretariat staff, Ms Dianne Fraser and Ms Cassandra Paulus. I would also like to thank the many foreign government representatives and officials who provided the Committee and me with much useful information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of this inquiry, it is evident to me that the refugee crisis is an international problem which will continue through this decade and into the twenty-first century. As a result, it is important that nations such as Australia continue to pursue the twin goals of achieving the best humanitarian outcome for asylum seekers, while maintaining control over their refugee programs and systems. It is towards these goals that the Committee has directed its recommendations in this report. I urge the Government to give immediate attention to the implementation of these recommendations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance between Refuge and Control</EMPHASIS>. I urge the Government to adopt the recommendations in the report in their entirety. Before I move to the report itself, I join with the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), in thanking the Committee's advisers and assistants, particularly Dr Kathryn Cronin, who assists very much as our legal adviser, our Secretary, Mr Andres Lomp, and his predecessor, Robina Mills, as well as the other staff. It is particularly important that this be noted because they have put an enormous amount of work and effort into the report. I am sorry that the Chairman of the Committee is not here to hear the comments that I offer in relation to the report because it is one of the more notable reports that the Parliament has seen in a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, the report is one with a bipartisan view&mdash;not one formed in the way which is often assumed; but one which is formed between all members of the Opposition and a majority of members of the Government. It is in relation to the most perplexing issue that needs to be resolved in the refugee area, and the issue which gave rise to the problems that Australia faces today in dealing with the refugee issue: the outstanding question of the PRC nationals who were here in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the Committee are conscious of the emotional environment in which a lot of the decisions in this area were taken. But this report catalogues in the most comprehensive way how the decisions taken in this area&mdash;starting with the decisions taken by the Government to market to PRC nationals in Australia the education of the English language&mdash;undermined the integrity of our immigration program and our ability to assist those people who have a need for refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report gives all of the sorry history in terms of the absence of control and the inability to undertake bona fides testing. It deals with the number of students who were allowed to arrive in Australia before the Tiananmen Square event and the number of them who were already here illegally before that event took place; in other words, those who had already breached visa conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also catalogues the number of people who came after the Tiananmen Square event and who have not left Australia; that is, the 44,644 people who came up to 31 May 1991 and the 16,382 who left. We had something of the order of 28,000 at that point of time still here in Australia. The report clearly deals with this matter in the most honest and frank way that any committee could, with a view to providing to the Government helpful advice as to the way this long term problem might be dealt with and assistance in ensuring that we have non-discriminatory principles in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Calwell commented, this report is one that a majority of members of the Committee&mdash;seven out of nine members&mdash;have agreed to entirely. The only people out of step were the Chairman and one other member. The majority recommendations on this issue present a challenge to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Government. They call for the abandonment of the proposals put in place by former Prime Minister Hawke, which constituted a discriminatory approach and gave the PRC nationals preferential treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition and Government members who formed the majority view of this Committee have taken a truly bipartisan approach. It is our view that the Government should demonstrate some flexibility and appreciation of the longstanding bipartisan principles of migration and make it clear that from 1994, under either a coalition or Labor government, the position will be as follows: the uncertainty concerning the long term future of the PRC permit holders will be resolved; from June 1994 permanent residence will be granted to those who hold four-year temporary entry permits on the same basis as any other applicant for permanent residence; non-discriminatory criteria will be an important principle in the refugee determination system; and that, in addition to the granting of permanent residence using universal selection criteria, there will be continued protection, established on a case by case basis against internationally accepted criteria, for any others who have a need for ongoing protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the view that, to assist in determining whether there is a need for ongoing protection for PRC permanent entry holders on an impermanent country assessment of human rights, the Government should be prepared to put together information to enable those people to be properly assessed against the situation in China and assurances should be sought from the Government of the People's Republic of China to ensure that permanent PRC permit holders who return to the People's Republic of China will not suffer discrimination or detention upon their return. We further determined that those PRC permit holders who do not meet selection criteria should be granted, on the expiry of their permits, a short extension of stay for, say, three months to enable them to put their affairs in order and to make appropriate arrangements for departing from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a point about this. The Chairman in his statement suggested that the Committee was in some way walking away from the statement of the former Prime Minister and not wanting to give effect to his undertaking. Let me make it clear that we did not want to make a political point of that sort, and we did not seek to do so. We sought to put in place provisions that would enable this matter to be resolved without rancour or difficulty and in a bipartisan way. As I said, it is an honest and frank assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of members of the Committee came to this view for a number of reasons. I want to emphasise two of them to ensure that it is well understood. Firstly, the majority of the members of the Committee wanted in place consistent and principled decision making; they wanted the same rules to apply to anybody from any part of the world. We wanted to get those provisions back in place. Secondly, we did not want a situation where we had, in effect, quasi-guest worker status for those people who are in Australia under these arrangements at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we adopt the view that is put by the Chairman or Senator Cooney, we are saying, `Look, we are going to have permanent residency for some people but we are going to have another class which will be for temporary entry, but quasi-permanent in character'. It would not give right to any other entitlements that people might have for benefits in Australia, even if they remain here for the whole of their lifetime. It would not give rise to rights to family reunion to the full extent that would apply to anybody else who is in Australia. In other words, it would open up Australia to a form of guest worker status that, as we have seen, has bedevilled countries in other parts of the world. All of us look in anguish at what is happening in Germany at this time. One of the reasons is that it has this guest worker status where people are brought in and allowed to remain permanently. They may be there for generations, but they are not citizens of the country. The majority of members do not want to see that occur in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is a most comprehensive report; it is one that is very worthy of this Government's consideration. I am glad the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is here because what we endeavoured to do in the most constructive way possible was to canvass the international situation&mdash;the problem that is affecting the world generally&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee has acknowledged many of the matters that the Government has addressed and has sought to assist by suggesting, with helpful advice, further steps that the Government might take. I will go through some of those points that ought to be made. We have looked at the problem that has been occasioned by the fact that refugee claimants, if they are given refugee status, have to apply for four-year temporary entry permits. We are conscious that there are some people, particularly those who have suffered torture and trauma, who are disadvantaged through not being able to consider permanent residency. We have sought to address that. I think it is a very appropriate series of recommendations that has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to humanitarian policy, we have endorsed the approach that the Government has taken, except for the PRC student issue, and given some helpful advice as to the way that can work in the future. In relation to the Minister's new proposals for a refugee tribunal, we have given advice as to the way in which that organisation ought to operate to overcome the problems that have occurred in the development of the Immigration Review Tribunal. We have suggested that there ought to be a senior member who is able to bring together members of the panel to constitute an appeal body to ensure that they can deal with model cases, and establish a framework of decision making which will bind all the members of the tribunal together. We think that is a very positive and helpful suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have suggested a positive approach to the question of offering legal advice. We wanted to bring to an end this business of providing legal advice right through the courts and the appeal arrangements. One should give them advice in the beginning and ensure that it is done properly, but take away the further extended nature of advice that now appears to be offered to many of those people who are seeking to make non bona fide claims. We have suggested the aid should only be available where there is a prima facie case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very critical of the fact that people have been held in detention for 2 1/2 years, but we do not want to undermine that system. We have suggested further steps that might be taken in relation to dealing with those who are held in detention. We believe that the putting in place of further arrangements will in part assist in relation to that, but clearly there is a view in the Committee's mind that the refugee tribunal needs to be the last resort and further appeals ought to be constrained. If it is helpful to the Minister to have that advice in putting in place a new regime, he will find it in this report. </PARA>

I know the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) is about to return to Cabinet. I wish there was somebody there with some sense; I do not know that the Minister will add much, but one hopes that he might.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as this report is concerned, I want to do as both the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Committee have done and commend Dr Kathryn Cronin and the staff of the Committee. The preparation and the work that has gone into the report has been excellent and they certainly deserve commendation. Ms Robina Mills, who was Mr Andres Lomp's predecessor, also deserves to be thanked for the contribution she made. But there is no doubt that the work of Dr Kathryn Cronin has been outstanding. We are extraordinarily fortunate to have had the benefit of her advice and guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to set down a bit of the background to the report and comment on it, because those points have not been brought out. Australia is in a rather different position from that which obtained since the end of World War II. It is not new for Australia to receive refugees, but it is true that only in recent years has the number of applicants from our region arriving by sea become a significant feature in the determination of refugee status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend those who are interested in the subject to table 3.1 on page 34 of the report. That table sets out the number of refugees arriving in Australia from January 1945 to June 1984 from the top 14 source nationalities. Importantly, that table indicates that the dimension of the refugee problem around the world today, as the report itself identifies, is significantly in Europe. Indeed, in an earlier table in the report, on page 14, table 2.1, the applications for asylum in European community countries are identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the immediate postwar years, Australia played a very important part in receiving refugees from the displaced peoples of Europe. It was that mass migration in the postwar years that largely changed the character of our country. All of us recognise and commend the influence that those who came from Europe have had on our culture and our society at large. In more recent years the movement of refugees has come significantly from the region around us and many of those people have arrived by sea rather than by plane. This report identifies the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who come by plane are in a different position, and to a large degree they have been dealt with fairly satisfactorily; although I think all of us have been a little concerned about some stories we have heard of people who have applied for refugee status and who perhaps have not been given the consideration they should have been. I believe that problem has largely been overcome, although from time to time there are reports which suggest that on occasions the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has not given adequate consideration to those who apply for refugee status on arrival at airports. It is very important to ensure that there is equity of treatment between those who arrive by sea and those who arrive by air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem, as it exists now, appears from table 5.1 on page 98. That table lists the applications for residence awaiting processing, compassionate and humanitarian cases. The number of people indicated in that table&mdash;10,928&mdash;identifies the crisis in our refugee determinations. It needs to be remembered that as soon as we accept somebody as a refugee we are prejudicing an application by a person who is applying for entry into Australia as a migrant, who might well have been in a queue for a long time. We have laid down the criteria for entry into Australia. While many of us have reservations about some aspects of those criteria, we realise that essentially they mean that some people wait for a long time before they can gain entry. A person who is coming in as a refugee of course gains precedence. I have a worry that there should be equity between those who come in as refugees and those who apply in the normal course to be migrants. That is something that we need to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to go over the details of each of the recommendations. I think in general the report is very good. I am one of those who had some doubts about this special status that was given to the Chinese applicants for refugee status post Tiananmen Square, and that is the four-year temporary entry permit. I have that reservation because it seems that we have already created a special entry condition. It is because of the problems of continuing that special entry condition that all the members of the Committee, except the Chairman and Senator Cooney, have come to the conclusion that there has to be some terminal way of putting to an end that temporary entry status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there has to be genuine recognition of the rights and responsibilities of Australia to accept those who meet the international criteria of reasonable fear of persecution. I tend to be one of those who think that where there has been a delay in processing, as there has with the Chinese boat people up in Port Hedland, it becomes far more difficult to expel the refugees after they have been here for a time, particularly when they have been in detention&mdash;as the report itself identifies, some for more than two years. If people enter, we have to adopt expeditious procedures to process them or an enormous problem is created. I do not think to date we have addressed that problem adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I criticise the Minister and his Department for the way in which they have not required the processing of documentation, and even the lodging of applications. The recommendations in respect of legal aid are designed to ensure that does not occur again. We have suggested that any applicant should have immediate and adequate access to legal advice to ensure that they can apply for refugee status so that the Department in turn can process that as soon as possible. Having talked to some of these applicants, I am worried whether we have treated them in the way in which they should be treated in a humane society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think people being confined for long periods of time creates difficulties. My answer is not to support Senator Cooney's minority recommendation, that is, that we release them, it is that we should make sure that their applications are, initially, lodged quickly and then processed quickly. Then we provide not for aid in all cases but only where there is a prime facie case which ensures a reasonable chance of their being successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend very much to the Government the system that we recommend with respect to the Refugee Review Tribunal. I think it is essential that there should be a capacity to provide uniformity of judgments. That is why we have recommended the appointment of a senior member to the RRT, who would be responsible for allocating work to Tribunal members to ensure the development and enhancement of country expertise, and who would also be empowered to establish three member tribunals to consider model cases for persuasive authority and precedence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of looking at that, I am most concerned at what seems to be the inner capacity of the Department with respect to country expertise. It just is not good enough. There needs to be a far better fund of knowledge available within the Department on the state of affairs in each country. If the consequence of the freedom of information applications is that the sources of that information might be disclosed&mdash;which means that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade does not provide the information to the Department&mdash;that needs to be exempted from FOI applications. As far as I am concerned, the Department has to have better information than appeared to me to be available during the course of our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite important that there be an adequate source of information. It has to be current. If the information is provided on a confidential basis, the privacy of source must be protected. I do not see that it needs necessarily to be passed on to applicant. I think that, in circumstances where the applicant claims a right of appeal, it should be only that information which is public that could reasonably be passed on. There are circumstances which obviously need to be taken into account by the Department and the Refugee Review Tribunal in making their determination. It is in that area that I think the Government again needs to take note of the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wanted to add two words with respect to the question of the Chinese students. It is a very difficult question. I think all of us recognise that the Government, in its attempt to promote English language instruction, did not put in place adequate supervision of those institutions that were offering English language instruction. I have been concerned that people have paid large sums of money in order to get English language instruction and some of them&mdash;certainly, for quite a long while&mdash;were disadvantaged because of the processes that they undertook. Some of the bodies in Australia certainly deserve to be criticised for the way they went out to try to attract clientele. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre the numbers of people who so flooded the system were such that there now needs to be a resolution to ensure that we get them out of the system. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) in his concern that we do not set up permanently a group of people who, one might say, are guest workers. They would have fewer rights as Australians than any other Australian if they were here under some different permanent condition of residence. It creates all sorts of problems if they are not able to participate in family reunions or have employment, and if those who because of their relationship with them, come in under some sort of conditional entry visa and are also denied employment. That is no good for the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us face it, as I suggested in the beginning, the number of boat people is likely to increase, not reduce. Whatever the negotiations we have in our region&mdash;which I hope are continued to try to ensure equitable treatment&mdash;from the flood of movement that is occurring in Europe, we need to understand that we are unlikely to be isolated simply because we are at the other end of the world. Those people from Europe will not come by sea, but we are likely to have to accept numbers of them through our participation within the United Nations and by negotiation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I do not want to see us accepting refugees from only one part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think we have to be very careful in dealing with those from Asia who come by sea so that we do not set up a unique condition of treatment which precludes us from playing a part on a worldwide basis. That is another aspect of the problem that I think needs to be kept in mind. I commend the report to the Parliament. I believe it is worth while. I suggest that the Government and those interested in the refugee question can gain a great deal by looking at the report and the statistics within it. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister ought to listen to this. This Bill is a simple, yet effective, example of the ongoing reform; an example of this Party's dedication to move with the times and get better value for the taxpayers' dollar. Day surgery is being used increasingly where an operation or other surgical procedure can be performed and the patients are sufficiently recovered to return to their own homes within one day. This not only saves the need and cost of having a patient remain in hospital when it is not necessary, but also it allows people to recuperate in more familiar surroundings.

If their research tells them that the people of Australia want to have a health care system where those who cannot pay are sacrificed; if their research tells them that the people of Australia want to pay more for their meat, milk, bread and vegetables; that 16-year-old kids want to beg their bosses to be given a few extra cents beyond the $3 slave wage; that some home buyers want to return to higher interest rates and higher inflation; that sacked Commonwealth public servants want to be kicked off the dole after nine months; and that Australians want to return to the bad old days of industrial chaos and confrontation, I would love to sit down and play a game of poker with them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last month the Keating Government, via the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), delivered its first and what will almost certainly be its last Budget. Without doubt it was the last throw of the dice for this failed Government for, when the people of Australia saw that the document offered nothing for them except more of the same, they gave it the thumbs down as a non event. The Australian people are now waiting for the next election to be called so they can vote this Government, and especially this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), out of office once and for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rarely, if ever, has this country seen such a tragic waste of what is now almost ten years of office. This country was once a vibrant leader amongst the great nations of the world, but after Gough Whitlam introduced the handout mentality, after Bob Hawke went through a period of policies of populist nothingness, and after the present Prime Minister gave us the recession we had to have, Australia has been reduced to an economic wasteland. This Government, via various Prime Ministers, has delivered a million jobless, despite its constant cries of compassion for the poor and its so-called trumpeting of social justice. It has given us record bankruptcies of business, particularly small business. It has blown out the overseas debt from about $23 billion net to $148 billion. One of the tragedies of that is that even after we take over after the next election, overseas debt will continue to increase&mdash;such is its momentum due to the structure of the economy at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has also delivered us with interest rates which have been at record levels for a record length of time. The architect of this appalling situation was indeed the previous Treasurer, the present Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland, one P.J. Keating. If we look at what this man has achieved as opposed to what he tells us, we find that he wins by the length of the straight the gold medal for the worst track record of any member of parliament in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost no exaggeration to say that when it comes to the economy, nearly every prediction the Prime Minister has made has been so wide of the mark as to blow away his credibility forever. This is shown in the comment of an ex-Minister in one of the previous Labor governments, Labor elder statesman, ex-Senator `Diamond' Jim McClelland, who said in a period back close to the Gulf war that Paul Keating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is like Saddam Hussein in that every disaster is called a victory. To coin a phrase, he saddamised the community.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's policies are on track.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1985 he said the Budget:</PARA>

<PARA>In 1986 he said the Budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1987 when delivering the Budget Speech he said:</PARA>

<PARA>In 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nation is successfully emerging from the most severe economic crisis in a generation . . . this is the one that brings home the bacon.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will emerge . . . without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1990 he said that the economy will improve:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know the truth of those statements. We have had time to judge them and all of them have been wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House that his record is a disaster. Like all Labor Treasurers, past and present, State or Federal, none of them can handle money when it comes to dealing with the economy. One only needs to look at the record of the last New South Wales Government, the present Western Australian Government, the present Victorian Government, the present South Australian Government, the previous Tasmanian Government and the present Australian Government. All have failed miserably when it comes to handling the economy. The present Prime Minister in so many ways must now be an acute embarrassment to his Party. For almost 10 years he has had his go, and he has failed and failed miserably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have that is offering for the future? I suggest it will be more of the same, if one studies the last Budget. One only has to look at the Budget Speech of the Treasurer this year. I quote from page 13:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the absence of new measures, revenues are also likely to decline. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the fiscal position nearer to the time is not stronger than is now projected, the Government will consider and implement a number of tax changes to maintain the revenue structure. These changes&mdash;referred to in the Budget Statements&mdash;would allow for the 1995-96 deficit to be between  1/2 per cent and 1 per cent of gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the famous statement made by the present Treasurer where he signals that this Government is going to have to bring in new taxes and possibly increase present taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a series of Budget deficits. When one includes last year's deficit with this year's, as well the deficits in subsequent years referred to in that quote, we will have a further blow-out in the Budget in the order of $50 billion. Last year the deficit was $9.3 billion. It is projected to be $13.4 billion this year. Next year it is projected to be $11 1/2 billion. If we are generous and say that the year after it will be $9 billion and the year after that again it will be $7 billion, we have an extra $50 billion to be tacked on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is not just in economic matters that this Government has gone astray. It is interesting to look back over the past decade at some of the other areas. Do honourable members remember the famous Bill of Rights that this Government tried to bring in and foist upon the Australian people? Fortunately it was rejected at the end because it was so unpopular. Goodness knows how much money was spent in trying to bring in that Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look back at the infamous Australia card which the Government tried to foist upon the Australian population. I dare say it would have brought the Government down if former Senator John Stone and his friend had not found a way to block it in the Senate. In one sense even though that has saved the Australian people from having the Australia card brought in, it probably also saved the Government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recall the four referendum questions that the previous Attorney-General and Deputy Prime Minister, Lionel Bowen, put to the Australian people. The then Government spent over $40m just holding that referendum and each of those four was rejected by record amounts. I think the vote was something like 80 per cent of Australian people voting No in every case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other area of great waste that received a little bit of publicity the other day. I refer to the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1987 under which the Government wished to investigate Nazi criminals and prosecute them in Australia. When the Government introduced that Bill, this side of the House pointed out what a ridiculous piece of legislation it was. A short period down the track from the passing of that amendment to the War Crimes Act, according to reports the Government has investigated 834 allegations against people living in Australia who were supposed to have been tied up in war crimes overseas. I believe that three of those 834 cases have prosecutions against them. One relating to a 78-year-old pensioner in Adelaide has been dropped; and there are two other still active prosecutions out there, one against a 75-year-old and the other against a 68-year-old. It is my guess that those cases probably will be dropped. There is one active file on a Melbourne person, but apparently the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) advised the Cabinet the other day that there are only limited prospects for success. So the Government has also dropped that. </PARA>

Blunder No. 1 was that it gave it to some councils and not to others. So, rather than getting pats on the back, as it expected, from all the councils around Australia, all it has done is to get the backs up of the councils that did not receive any money. One has only to look at my electorate, my new electorate from the next election, which will take in 40 per cent of New South Wales. It is probably the most impoverished part of Australia at present, experiencing in many areas the worst drought in the country's history. Seven shires got some money&mdash;Wellington, Bogan, Coonamble, Bourke, Brewarrina, Central Darling and Broken Hill. Broken Hill got $700,000; those others got less than half a million dollars between them, which is less than one seven-hundredth of the money doled out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go further and look at what is actually proposed to come out of this spending of $345m. I turn to the employment paper which is the last of the Budget Papers. The very last paragraph of the last page reveals all. It states that the Government hopes to create 13,000 jobs right across Australia over a two-year period. So there we have it: only 13,000 jobs created&mdash;and, what is more, temporary jobs. If we cost that out, it works out at $26,538 per job. As most of those jobs will last no longer than three months, on an annualised basis we are looking at a cost to the taxpayer of $100,000 per job. So all we will do ultimately when we finally fund these jobs is to tax business and put marginal jobs, real jobs, out in order to create government jobs&mdash;painting rocks white, so to speak. All the Government is doing is putting taxes up in the long run to destroy more real jobs than it is creating in the short term. All it is doing is creating artificial government jobs to hide the unemployment problem out past the next election&mdash;a cynical exercise if ever I saw one. Nothing shows more how bereft is this Government in its capacity to solve the problem that it has created than does this RED scheme revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time remaining, I would like to address my comments to the car industry because it has come in for debate in recent days. The Government is trumpeting that it is going to leave the tariff at 15 per cent later in this decade and that somehow this will save the industry whereas the coalition will reduce the tariff to 5 per cent. Somehow 15 per cent will save the industry and 5 per cent will be a disaster. What the Government, in running this illogical line, is overlooking is that the coalition will remove payroll tax, which works out at a reduction in cost of about $350 to $400 a car. We will remove wholesale sales tax, and we will remove fuel excise of at least 19c, if not 26c a litre in business cases. But we will not just remove those things; we will front end load them because we will put those benefits up front from 1 October 1994 for six years before we get down to that negligible level of 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, because we will lower tariffs to 5 per cent, all cars will be $1,000 cheaper to the customers of Australia than they would be under the Government's policy. So what this Government is in effect saying is that it is for more expensive cars; that is what it is saying. In what I have said so far, I have not even allowed for the industrial relations changes which are desperately needed in the car industry to drag it kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like honourable members to contemplate for a moment the car industry itself. There are 335,000 people employed in the car industry. Of those, 66,000 are employed in the assembly and parts industries and 269,000 in the rest of the car industry, servicing all of those cars, selling petrol, selling cars or maintaining them on the road. That is a ratio of four in the service industries to every one in the assembly industry. If we can make those cars cheaper by $1,000 a car, as the Government acknowledges, and if we can make the customers who buy those cars wealthier by giving them such things as $95 per week in tax cuts&mdash;as the miners in my electorate of Broken Hill will be getting&mdash;we will sell more cars. What will happen if we sell more cars? That ratio of 4 : 1 will come into play and we will need more people employed in the service industries, and I believe more people employed in the assembly industry also. That has not even taken into account the fact that businesses will be able to buy their cars 15 per cent cheaper on top of that because they will get a refund of the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our policy is for more jobs in the car industry overall. It is a good bet that there will be more jobs in the assembly industry as well as more jobs all over Australia&mdash;we believe two million more jobs by the end of the century. The policy we have now makes cars $4,000 dearer, on today's figures, and that is a drain of $1,600m on the 400,000 cars we sell each year. That works out at $25,000 per job, which is exactly the amount of money that the average worker in the car assembly industry is earning today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget builds upon One Nation and the youth package to give a moderate fiscal stimulus to the Australian economy to the extent of about $4.2 billion. The deficit is projected at $13.4m, about 3.3 per cent of GDP. Outlays are estimated at 27 per cent of GDP, which compares very favourably with the 30 per cent of GDP of the Budget of 1984-85. In those circumstances it is entirely responsible, given the domestic and overseas recession, to run a deficit of this nature. The key economic forecasts in the Budget are, of course, a demand estimated at 2.75 per cent, business investment at minus 2 per cent, plant and equipment at 3.75 per cent, employment at one per cent, unemployment to average 10.5 per cent, GDP at 3 per cent, inflation at 2 per cent and the current account deficit at 3.75 per cent of GDP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still think that if there is any risk in this Budget it is on the down side rather than the up side; that is, poor investment performance, low growth and intractable unemployment figures are a greater risk than a blow-out in imports or a surge in the current account deficit. However, one trusts that these Budget projections are more reliable than has been the case in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said at this point how unfortunate the Government has been on two fronts. Firstly, there has been an apparent total inability of Treasury&mdash;and, I must say, of Government advisers and perhaps of some senior Ministers too&mdash;to produce reasonably accurate forecasts, particularly in 1991 and 1991-92, and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document, on which fiscal and monetary policy could be based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecast for gross domestic product in the 1991 Budget was 2 per cent. Of course, we actually had minus 0.8 per cent. In 1991-92 we saw a projection of 1.5 per cent and we had average growth of 0.4 per cent. These are all average growth figures. One Nation projected a 4 3/4  per cent growth for 1992-93, and this Budget projects 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a breakdown in projections occurs, such as occurred in those two Budgets and in the One Nation statement, virtually every other major forecast goes out the window. For instance, the deficit can explode, investment can be lower than projected and unemployment will be higher. Above all, hope and confidence in the community, especially in business and industry, can fade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inaccurate forecasting can be politically dangerous and can lead to precious opportunities being lost. For example, as a result of inaccurate forecasting, real interest rates were kept too high for too long in 1989-90 and, I think, in the calendar year 1991. As a result of inaccurate forecasting, we saw delayed opportunities for fiscal expansion and improvements to investment incentives in 1990 and 1991. These matters were, to an extent, rectified in the One Nation statement and in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inaccurate 4 3/4 per cent projection of the One Nation statement led to the problem of how to achieve a surplus by 1995-96 and extend personal tax cuts amounting to $8.6 billion over two years to 1995-96 at the same time, since all this depended on 4 per cent plus growth over three years; and that was a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last February-March I wrote that the Labor Government was in danger of economic derailment from this puzzling failure to advance credible economic forecasts and that 4 3/4 per cent growth in 1992-93 would not be met. In truth, most street-smart economists and politicians should have known this at the time, given the flat domestic economy and the international situation in the United States, Japan and Europe. I conclude that there must be a major shake-up and revamp of economic forecasting branches and units in the Treasury. There is no question about it: that is what is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of ill fortune suffered by this Labor Government has been the continuing overseas recession, excessively high German interest rates and the inability of the OECD and the IMF to get their projections right. For example, recently the IMF forecast average GDP for the United States of 2.1 per cent in 1992 and 3.4 per cent in 1993, and for Japan of 1.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent in 1992 and 1993 respectively, and the same for Germany. However, I do not believe there is much optimism anywhere in the world, so I doubt that these IMF forecasts will be achieved. Today I read this in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Westpac</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Market Insights</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No country can point to strong consumer spending at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>Recently I travelled through the US and Germany. I had some talks with the US Federal Reserve, the Treasury of the United States and some commercial banks, and, of course, with the Bundesbank officials in Germany. All of them said that this is a time of consolidation and not a time of growth. Rather than project 1.9 per cent and 3.5 per cent growth for 1992-93, Bundesbank officials were projecting to me 1 1/2 per cent for 1992 and probably just in excess of 2 per cent for calendar year 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US banks, similarly, were predicting 2 per cent growth for 1992 and probably not in excess of 2 1/2 per cent growth for 1993. These are the latest trends. President Bush knows it too well, and that is why he is bribing US farmers and talking about tax cuts early next year if he wins, which I think is a highly doubtful proposition at this stage. He is offering tax cuts despite the horrendous US Budget deficits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, Japan is stimulating its economy with a $A125 billion fiscal package. As the Bank of Japan reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today, Japan is apparently looking at the worst recession since the 1970s. At any rate, even if those figures are achieved, I believe that Australian unemployment at 11 per cent, and 10 1/2 per cent average, for this financial year cannot be tolerated. In those circumstances, $4.3 billion is a moderate fiscal response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that job losses are quite serious. Industry restructuring, plus the recession, has caused the job losses in this country. The recession was caused by high interest rates through 1989 and compounded by the overseas situation that I have just been talking about. Necessary restructuring in the steel industry cost 14,000 jobs during the 1980s in Port Kembla alone. The private sector has lost 385,000 jobs in two years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and manufacturing was down 75,000 jobs in one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, figures showed that full time jobs in August went down by 30,000. Many regions, such as Wollongong and south-western Sydney, are looking at 15 per cent-plus unemployment. My point is that, even if the Budget estimates on unemployment are correct, employment has reached totally unacceptable levels for the labour movement in this country. Something more will have to be done about it, in my view. Measures to encourage exports and to establish new value added industries to increase growth and create jobs will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to give the impression that all is gloom on the economic horizon; not at all. Many policy pluses are in place. They are the building blocks of the future. Inflation is down to 2 per cent, and the Australian dollar, at last, is fluctuating between US71c and US72c and has gone down on the TWI. That is very helpful to export industries and import competing industries. We have a stimulatory fiscal policy in place, we are increasing spending on infrastructure, and on top of that we have in place an accelerated depreciation allowance and a 10 per cent investment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing starts are up, as they ought to be, as housing rates have come down by 8 per cent over the last couple of years. They were up 9 per cent in June. We have a credible wages policy in place, involving enterprise agreements, the maintenance of the Industrial Relations Commission and an equitable minimum award system to provide wages at a fair level to youth and low income earners. I note in passing that this coalition Opposition would terminate the IRC and terminate awards, and intends to pay the youth of this country the slave wage of $3 per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a major education expansion in place, including big increases in spending, in labour market programs and in vocational training. As I have said, these are the building blocks of the future. Above all, the other great plus for this Government, while I am listing the pluses, is that it does not intend to introduce a goods and services tax of 15 per cent on jobs&mdash;that is, on value added industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the fall in the Australian dollar, I think that is good for industry. I do not think it will be inflationary, at least not very much, and I do not think it will fall further. There must be no increase in official interest rates. I think that people, particularly in the media, should drop talk of the possibility of having to increase interest rates again, because I believe that will not happen, nor should it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also probably on balance there ought not to be any early further additional cuts in official interest rates. The reason why the Australian dollar has fallen is not because of the Budget deficit, but because of international differentials in short term real interest rates. For instance, in the United States that differential is less than one per cent; in Germany it is 6.4 per cent; and in Australia it is somewhere in between those figures at 4 per cent. Germany, of course, has resorted to high interest rates in order to curb inflation resulting from reunification costs. Also, Bundesbank officials told me that they had resorted to high interest rates in order to curb future expectation in wages growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that pressure will come off German interest rates over the next two or three months. I confidently predict that, because that is the sort of message that came through to me in Germany recently. I think it will happen before Christmas at any rate. I think that the reason for the coming reduction in German rates is that it finally has its inflation under control. The Bundesbank is now satisfied with wages growth expectations for 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Germany has a worsening economy by the month, in tandem with a large budget deficit, so there is no scope for loosening fiscal policy in Germany. If it wants to get its economy moving, it really has to be on the monetary policy interest rate front. It is also suffering increasing pressure from other EC nations which feel that they are being held hostage through German monetary policy and high interest rates, and also a very strong deutschmark in comparison to the UK pound and the US dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that there is no reason for the Reserve Bank to be even thinking of increasing official interest rates in the near future. That would be a disaster for a sluggish economy and declining investment. I note, again in passing, that the Opposition would lift inflation and interest rates in this country by the introduction of a goods and services tax. But we have not done too well on investment either. I have to say that and it is evident in the Budget Papers. In fact, I would go so far as to say that in an otherwise moderately satisfactory Budget, investment is the black hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics states in its latest report that manufacturing investment in the calendar year 1991 went down by 11.7 per cent. There is an upside in manufacturing. Exports, particularly elaborately transformed manufactured exports, are 34 per cent and 14 per cent respectively of our exports, and $1.3 billion of that is in motor vehicles. That is a terrific performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The downside is that in manufacturing we have lost over 130,000 jobs since September 1989, and TCF is set to lose 50,000 jobs by 1995. Restructuring is necessary, but it is also necessary to establish alternative jobs and new industries. It is true, in my belief, that although we have general investment incentives of an improved nature now in place as a result of One Nation, further specific measures are now required to assist specific new industries. I think the first one is to extend export facilitation to all elaborately transformed manufactured exports; and the second is to extend specific assistance to specified new industries via the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, as in the United States, the lowest interest rate since the 1960s has not generated increased investment in new industries. This is a legacy of the wasteful 1980s when corporate debt surged to the highest levels this century. The people I spoke to in the US Treasury and in the Federal Reserve agree with me on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, in 1992, business and industry are repairing their balance sheets. They are refinancing at lower interest rates and restructuring their existing operations. They are not yet in an expansionary or investment mode. Banks are very cautious; their margins are outrageously high and jobs are still being lost. This process has still some time to run, but capital reformation is under way. It is not so much a matter of a shortage of world capital, in my view, but as to when  borrowing and investment will commence again&mdash;and, when it does, which nations will attract this investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, Australia needs additional specific incentives on top of the One Nation initiatives. I think they should be of a non-tariff, non-bounty assistance nature&mdash;for example, tax holidays for new industries, as has been offered in the past by the tiger economies of South East Asia, and lower corporate tax rates for a fixed period after cash flow commences for agreed new industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to gain and expand industries such as wool and cotton processing&mdash;I certainly am very pleased at the initiative that was taken by Senator Button to help in the establishment of the new wool processing plant in Geelong by the German firm based at Bremen, whose factory I visited recently&mdash;food processing, aerospace industries, information and communications, technology and products and maybe even electronic goods, further incentives will be necessary as nations fight for advantage in investment over the next several years as reinvestment occurs throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I am sorry that I cannot really be more optimistic, but I believe that when we are in public office and are in the Parliament of Australia, we really should speak our minds and call the shots as they are and as we see them. I do not think that any economy, with the exception of Japan, can balance the ever more complex technologies of production with employment growth sufficient to provide full, or even near full, employment in future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one thing is absolutely certain. This Labor Government with its policies on social justice, on education and vocational training, on its consensus on industrial relations&mdash;which has the support of business, industry and unions&mdash;its more moderate and sensible position on tariffs, and its refusal to countenance consumption taxes, is infinitely preferable to a coalition government. Such a government would ignite an industrial relations bonfire that would wreck the motor vehicle industry with zero to 5 per cent tariff levels, and destroy some 114,000 jobs and $1.4 billion of new investment. This Government is preferable to a coalition government which would reignite inflation with a $27 billion to $30 billion goods and services tax. Such zealots and inflexible ideologues can never and will never govern this country. </PARA>

<PARA>The summary of the practices adopted in Asia, as analysed by Heather Smith, drawing together the work of a number of economists, is that macroeconomic policies are the ones that can best allow a nation to flourish, rather than a policy of trying to pick winners.

I think most Australians know that our mining industries are internationally competitive and that they have helped to pay the bills also. </PARA>

I guess that if one consults the participants in those industries one becomes aware that they too are concerned about how well they can manage and how well they have done in the past. In an analysis presented to the Industry Commission inquiry into the automotive industry, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries outlined what it felt the Government was doing to restrict it. On page 29, right at the beginning of this report, the organisation states that government needs to get out of the way to allow it to do things in a certain number of areas. It says that we do not need to have the wages or the living standards of Asia but we need the Government to remove some things, thus allowing us to become competitive and able to hold up our heads in the international region. </PARA>

However, there is no mechanism for achieving those goals. That is why we have employment creating programs, education programs, superannuation increases and statements in the Budget and One Nation, some of which have been partially followed but most not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has lost its determination and direction to deliver for Australia what Australians themselves say they want. So we have a manufacturing industry beset by many problems. We have the worst recession for 60 years. People are not buying stuff; Aussies cannot afford to buy stuff. Their standard of living is too low to allow them to buy the sorts of products they want to buy. On top of that, the Government has instigated a regime of massive interest rates so that people wanting to expand or buy things as the ingredients of a manufacturing process have had to pay exorbitant interest rates. People were not prepared to make new investment or buy new equipment and machinery. There is no new activity; it is all low activity. The automobile industry is trying to develop new models to stay competitive in the process. The Ford company itself has lost market share. The quality of its vehicles and industrial disputes have marked it as having great difficulties in management. </PARA>

The Australian automotive industry has selected four major areas that it thinks the Government should deal with. First, it has asked for the level of taxation to be reduced so that there are incentives for effort in the community. Secondly, it has asked that the tax mix which disadvantages manufactured goods&mdash;which are subject to a wholesale sales tax and represent some 70 per cent of the GDP&mdash;relative to services be more equitable and the same as the tax that the rest of the country pays. Thirdly, it wants the sales tax that motor vehicles attract to be reduced. Fourthly, it wants taxes on fuel to be dealt with. It says, rightly so, that taxes on fuel are effectively taxes on motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The automobile industry and our manufacturers have been asking for a new package and attention from the Government for two years. The Government has not delivered. The Prime Minister has resolved this situation by retreating more into the past instead of seizing the present and looking to the future. In a comparison of international attractiveness of Australia's position relative to selected automotive producers, 10 factors were considered. We score really badly in a number of areas compared with most nations. We score badly for our innovative forward orientation. We are not prepared to drive into the future to take advantage of our comparative advantages. Our outward orientation, our besetting of the mixes of policies, is also poor and we score below Germany, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Canada, the USA and Korea.

While it is recognised that we have a long way to go, the Government fiddles with Budgets at the margin and then criticises the Opposition for producing a plan that meets the needs of Australian manufacturers and the Australian people by reducing taxation, dealing with wholesale sales tax and looking at fuel excise and a whole raft of other measures that are designed to give Australia a boost of $20 billion from cuts in taxes; another $10 billion from reform of our infrastructure, our wharves, shipping and the rest of our transportation system; and a further $20 billion from the industrial reforms that we need to make. A total of $50 billion is going into the Australian economy to give Australia a boost&mdash;to give Australians a fair go, give average Aussies a chance and make them feel proud again that we are worth while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue has come down to whether or not there should be protection for Australian industry. There should be protection for Australian industry and that basically comes from having anti-dumping and other procedures to stop the international cheats. We ought to be able to get in there, clout them and stop them playing games with us. It is not a matter of building walls that they need to jump over for the cost of their goods; it is a matter of stopping them abusing Australia. There is the classic instance of apricots being purchased in Turkey. Somehow or other those apricots were allowed into Australia and were not able to be sold here because the quality was so low. But when the importer wanted to export them again, he had a problem on his hands. He wanted to get them out of country, but he was not allowed to export them because the quality was so low. They were of good enough quality for Aussies to eat, but too poor for us to export. So those are the crazy things that we are doing in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has fooled around with its anti-dumping and countervailing measures, but it has done nothing.

We need to be smart by instigating anti-dumping and countervailing duty processes which will advantage Australia&mdash;not to protect us, but to stop the international cheats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the tariff debate is concerned, it is wonderful how the Prime Minister says that a tariff level of 15 per cent is such a massive difference from 5 per cent, when there was a drop in protection in the auto industry in 1988, just four years ago, from 243 per cent to an effective 113 per cent&mdash;which is half the protection. That is the sophistry of the Prime Minister. He dissembles here day after day, using language that this House should not have to listen to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year on the John Laws show the Prime Minister said that at the end of the tariff phase-in, which is in 1997 and 2000, he will have removed tariffs altogether. Those are his real views, and now he is trying to argue that the 10 per cent difference between the Opposition and the Government is a significant difference at the end of the day. Of course, it is not. The real things that will make a difference to Australia are those things that the automobile industry has identified: providing incentive, relieving Australians of taxation, giving people an opportunity to take a second job or work overtime without penalty, and allowing Australians to buy cheaper goods because those goods that we make ourselves will be made more efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the situation just across the water, in New Zealand. Its economy was really bad news. It was in an extremely bad way, but it is starting to recover. It has settled its wages problems in a wonderful way&mdash;92 per cent of people are getting the same or more. Yet I know that there are people on the other side of the House who will continue to be hypocritical about this process and say that wages will be cut. That is not true. The facts do not prove that in any way whatsoever. We can do better if we have the shackles taken off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has to stop its hypocrisy, stop talking about whether 15 per cent is as bad as 5 per cent and deal with the macro-economic things. If it is prepared to look at the big picture, Australians will be able to buy motor cars a lot cheaper than they can today&mdash;$4,000 a vehicle cheaper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the past two Budget debates I have devoted my contributions to criticisms of the policies of economic rationalism that have broken the hearts of Labor's rank and file, obsessed the minds of the Liberal Party and totally enthralled Australia's bureaucracy over the past decade. Nothing I have seen in the past 12 months has moderated my contempt for the neo-classical economics and those who peddle its immoral, unprincipled philosophies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there can be no doubt that Australians are beginning to reject these marketeers and turn their faces towards policies more conducive to social harmony and economic stability. This Budget may well be seen by historians as the turning point, when Australian politicians buried the fallacious argument that all we had to do was free up the market and permit business to pursue its own self-interests whereupon our economy would boom and prosperity would be showered upon all who were prepared to work for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that, as we approach the twentieth anniversary of the sacking of the Whitlam Government, we should contrast the policy directions of that era with those of the past decade. I emphasise that I am not talking about the economic settings of the Whitlam Budgets, which most commentators would agree involved imprudent spending. However, just because it can be said in retrospect that Gough and his Ministers tried to do too much too soon, it does not follow, as the rationalists would have us believe, that Whitlam's social policies were wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s, government economic policy was dominated by a value system based on a humane and compassionate society giving encouragement and support to all Australians to play a full role in our community. It was characterised by respect of human rights and dignity, promotion of social justice for the disadvantaged and the development of a society accepting all classes, cultures and creeds. Those values were enshrined per medium of traditional Labor economic policies which were rooted in the Keynesian economic position that the market, left to itself, would not produce a full employment level of output and that meant that governments had to intervene to manage demand and stabilise fluctuations in the level of economic activity. Such policies incorporated the belief that Australia's unique history and geography made it imperative that the public sector play a special role in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True it was that these early Keynesian policies tended to be somewhat naive, but they were capable of adaptation and much greater sophistication. They did not deserve to be dumped for a neo-classical philosophy which presented as new scientific economic thinking, but which really represented a throw back to the discredited and failed policies of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the sad truth is that politics, like economics, is a cyclical business and in the wave of political reaction that saw Labor leaders like Whitlam, Dunstan and Wran depart the political stage we were thrown into an era of government by chartered accountant, where greed was god and the public sector activity had to be sacrificed at its altar. The new credo was the maximisation of the scope of corporate and individual activity and the sacred icon of the new economic religion was the market mechanism. The neo-classical theory was dubbed `rationalism' because its gurus constantly asserted that it was based on scientific empiricism. The implied corollary to the title was that its opponents were irrational&mdash;and they were often sneered at as the `looney Left' or `voodoo economists'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what the rationalists were about was no different from their discredited laissez faire primogenitors. They saw society purely as a marketplace and sought to separate economic science from the culture in which it operated. They told us that the only choice for Australians was between a command or centrally planned economy or an absolutely free market system. They entertained no debate about middle ground models which would allow governments to create equitable, just societies by intervening to ensure competitive markets operated in a socially acceptable way. When faced with the inevitable cyclical boom-bust nature of free market economics they simply shrugged and told us that life was not meant to be easy and that recurring market failure is the cost that we have to pay to maintain individual freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had a healthy disregard for zealots and believe Australian society should reject those who preach that greed is good and that the law of the jungle is the proper order of things. I have no less disregard for the nonsense the rationalists spout about even playing fields and the infallibility of the market mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the real world speculation constantly dominates enterprise, economic power is never evenly spread and complex cumulative processes control prices. Despite the rationalists' rejection of concepts such as morality, social values such as integrity, initiative, freedom and thrift play a major role in market outcomes. For example, the criminality of the likes of Bond, Skase, Connell and the business irresponsibility of the Australian banks greatly impacted on the confidence of the Australian markets and attitudes of our trading partners. Australians are still paying a very heavy price for the antics of those corporate cowboys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real economies are nothing like the computer models of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). They are not simply the sum of their parts or susceptible to simplistic arithmetical modelling&mdash;often sectors have discrete lives of their own. The complexity of their interaction and the immense potential for major error makes a joke of those who claim to be able to make economic policy on a scientific basis. Such people are about as reliable as long-range weather forecasters. Allowing the market free rein will produce times of great prosperity, but it will also guarantee regular recessions and occasional depressions. The lives of the rich will be enhanced by such a system but great suffering and impoverishment will be periodically visited upon the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationalists also gloss over or choose to ignore other fatal flaws in their models. For example, the environmental movement is constantly pointing out that the most profitable industrial processes invariably produce the most pollution. The builders of the atomic reactors at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island thought that they were producing cheap energy, but the ultimate cost to their communities was immense. One of the first rationalist economies was Brazil. It grew rapidly, but the cost was international environmental disaster, as natural resources, including the Amazon forests, were raped, affecting us all. Unsustainable development fits nicely within economic rationalist thinking, which puts individuals before the community, even if it leads to social disaster. Little is said by the rationalists about the increasing international mobility of capital. Capital today tends to move around the world to where the cheap labour is. To a much lesser extent labour will move around a nation to where the capital is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dual mobility results in powerful pressures to reduce wages. Australian workers are now being told by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his Leader that they will have to lower their wages or the jobs will move offshore. They are also being told that if we are to compete with cheap Asian labour we will also have to cut or abandon long held conditions, such as social security, unemployment benefits, workers compensation, superannuation and health and environmental protection. We should be very wary of the uncontrolled logic of these arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 30 years the Third World has continued to get poorer. Becoming increasingly desperate to survive, Third World countries will accept lower and lower incomes and conditions. Eventually a free flow of capital to Third World countries would equalise wages, but at very low levels and with catastrophic results for the standards of living in countries such as Australia. Already the emergence of a vast underclass can be seen in developed nations. The recent Los Angeles riots bring the implications of this pattern home to Australians. The last decade has seen Australia follow the American and British trend to increasing inequality of incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of having highly efficient markets if their effect on society is to produce great wealth for a shrinking minority and increasing misery for everyone else? We would all like to pay less taxes, but with the exception of the Leader of the Opposition and his fellow members of the Gordon Gekko society, most Australians also want to maintain high standards in education, transport, communications, health services, defence, policing and environment protection. Those standards cannot be achieved in the feudal jungle the rationalists would make Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like it or not, society is an interdependent phenomenon&mdash;we have to work together if there is to be a common good. To ensure social harmony and economic stability we have to provide safety nets for the poor, the disadvantaged and the underprivileged. Having an equitable, socially just society does not mean we lack freedom, any more than laws against murder restrict individuals rights of self-expression, nor does it mean that our economy should not be productive or efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How dare the rationalists describe the primitive lifestyle they wish to create as free. The American trends are proof enough of the great lie behind those arguments. There they are developing a form of new feudalism where the privileged are retreating behind high walls guarded by ever increasing numbers of private police and sophisticated security systems. Larger and larger proportions of their wealth are being used to protect themselves from the poverty stricken hordes who, being without jobs, social security or an adequate health scheme, burn, rape and pillage like the barbarians of old. Sooner rather than later such underclasses are going to become so numerous that they represent a real threat to the stability of democratic societies. Unstable nations' economies will never be productive or efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the economic problems facing Australia and the world are horrendous. However, they will not be successfully resolved by adopting the amoral pseudo-scientific stance of the rationalists. We must face up to the real questions of ethics, of social morality, which affect us all, no matter what our religious or philosophical commitments are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, I believed that, despite our obvious party political differences, we shared a vision for the betterment of Australian society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, I cannot say that about the current leadership of the conservative forces in this Parliament. They are the true radicals&mdash;radicals of the Right&mdash;who would happily visit social chaos upon us all in their fanatical commitment to the view that market forces will solve everything. There is no starker example of the yawning ideological gap between the major parties at the moment than the issue of industrial relations and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback plan presents a policy based on the Liberals' perceived need to substantially lower unit labour costs. A 30 per cent reduction in the unit cost of labour is the Opposition's objective, and it has talked about a wide range of plans to reduce wages and conditions. However, the Liberals have reneged on their promise to produce a draft Bill outlining their industrial relations policy. All we have to rely on is a series of sometimes contradictory statements made by their Leader and the honourable member for Bennelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, they proposed to scrap our conciliation and arbitration system of awards and replace it with a deregulated, market driven system based on direct negotiation between employers and employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unions will be excluded from the negotiations, and strikers will be made to personally pay for any economic loss the employer sustains.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has recently turned turtle and has said that employers will now have the option to stay within the awards system if they want to.

They identify two obstacles in that exercise; that is, excessive labour costs and tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's radical solution is to scrap the accord and our arbitration system, crush the unions, reduce wages to the level of our Asian trading partners, and reduce all tariffs to zero.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government relied on macro-economic policy strategy to maintain job growth, and on the accord to maintain wage restraint. I have always seen a flaw in the accord; that is, it did not lock employers into the system.

If the employers had been locked into the accord, we would have had a better result.

In the end, of course, it will be quality that counts because, if Australians do not receive education and training equal to the best in the world in the open trading environment of this coming decade and beyond, they will certainly not be able to hold down jobs which will withstand international competition. Quality is the key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there must be opportunities for all young Australians to build their knowledge and skills. It is one of our main criticisms of this Government that it has unduly restricted and limited the capacity of young Australians to pursue their education. As the United</PARA>
<PARA>States, which has traditionally had one of the world's highest participation rates, has found, sheer numbers of completions mean little if quality is not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's attempts to claim higher retention and participation rates as its main educational achievement do not withstand examination. The truth is that school retention rates have been rising for decades. In 1967, 22.7 per cent of students went through to year 12. By 1983, this figure was 40.6 per cent&mdash;up from 34.9 per cent in 1976 when the Fraser Government took office. By 1986, the figure had reached 48.7 per cent and in 1990 it was 64 per cent. The Prime Minister always contrives to understate the participation rate in the year that Labor came to power&mdash;but we know from his attack on the flag that history was never his strong point. If the Government has made a distinctive contribution to higher retention it is through the impact of the failure of its economic policies in destroying job opportunities for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous coalition Government had a proud record of expanding educational opportunity. It was the coalition led by Sir Robert Menzies which began the great expansion in the university sector, and it was the coalition which initiated the policy under which the colleges of advanced education were founded. In 1960, there were 53,391 higher education students in Australia. By 1983, this number had increased to 348,577. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not entitled to claim any special credit at all for rising educational participation. Given the rising level of qualifications and skills throughout the world, it would have been shocking if it had not increased. It is shocking that the Government, for ideological reasons, continues to restrict the right of parents to choose an appropriate school for their child and to restrict access to tertiary places so that tens of thousands of qualified students are locked out. The Government's policies give every impression of having been deliberately designed to stop Australians investing in education&mdash;in their own education and in that of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failures of this Government's policies in education and training are visible at every level of education. After nine years of Labor, one in five Australians does not have even basic functional skills in reading, writing and mathematics, science standards are falling demonstrably relative to other countries, language education has declined, and the knowledge at senior grade levels of Australia's history and institutions is abysmal. The status of teaching as a profession has been eroded and parents who want to choose a school for their child have been discriminated against year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to training, by the Prime Minister's own admission Australia is facing a training emergency. The number of places for young people in vocational education and training has actually declined in recent years as a result of the Government's policy failures. In an address last week, Mr Richard Sweet of the Dusseldorp Skills Forum surveyed the fate of the Government's traineeship system based on subsidised wages. Mr Sweet pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its inception, the Australian Traineeship system has never been able to meet its annual target of 75,000 places adopted as a goal in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intakes peaked at 13,796 in 1989-90, but have fallen by around 5,000 to 8,698 in the last two years. This 37 per cent decline in traineeship intakes over the two years is about the same as the observed rate of decline in apprenticeship commencements over the period.</PARA>

<PARA>Labor's deliberately chosen training policy has been a complete failure and it is now setting out on a new venture under the guidance of Mr Laurie Carmichael: an Australian certificate of vocational education grounded in competency based training. In theory, of course there is much to be said for competency based training if it is genuinely applied and if it is applied only in those areas for which it is suitable&mdash;mainly the trade related areas. Misapplied, it has the potential to do great harm, and the obvious agenda of the Carmichael report is to produce a centralised system of competency definitions linked to the centralised industrial relations system where promotion and pay will be according to certification and where certification is linked directly into the award arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the industry focus of the system there is a very great danger that the needs of individual enterprises will be overlooked and that employers will end up being forced to pay for training which is of no relevance to them. The Government's approach carries with it the danger that a whole new nationwide and centralised bureaucratic system is about to be imposed on industry, with the trade union movement exercising a veto through tripartite tribunals at every point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Years have been wasted as the Government has neglected quality vocational education and training for young people as a result of its preoccupation with participation rates in schooling and with its union inspired forced amalgamations between universities and colleges of advanced education. This latter policy, which was never explained or justified on educational grounds and which not even the Government now claims has resulted in significant financial savings in the provision of higher education, was part of the Government's attack on the so-called elitism of the universities in pursuit of its egalitarian ideologies. It has resulted in exploding costs in a number of institutions and has produced a demoralising upheaval which has made academic life increasingly unattractive to those who would otherwise have contemplated an academic career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards across higher education are being squeezed down as a result of this policy of forced amalgamations and there is a looming shortage of up to 20,000 qualified academic staff&mdash;a shortage to which this policy has been a significant contributor. The forced amalgamations have not been the only contribution the Government has made to the decline of academic staff conditions. The centralised industrial relations arrangements imposed on universities after 1985 forced on these institutions an inappropriate model which was drawn from the corporate world, with an ideology of confrontation and national uniformity. It has been one of the most significant factors in depriving Australia's universities of control over their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But beyond all of that, its great failure has been that it has presided over a sharp decline in the conditions of academic employment relative to those in other countries. For that reason it should be condemned. The failure of this system, so beloved of the Government, is another major contributing factor to the declining attractiveness of academic careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The threat that the staff shortage poses to standards is a significant one, but students and staff in universities are well aware of the effect on standards of the overcrowding and declining resources per student which also result from this Government's policies. Here we come to the effects of the absurd system of central regulation which the Government has imposed on the university system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of overcrowding are a direct result of the regulations the Government has imposed on the universities. The student quotas mean that universities are not funded for the additional students they take in. The incentive was always to enrol up to the quota, never under it. Overcrowding is a direct result not of numbers of students, but of unfunded students. The Government's recession has induced many students to stay on in university. The result has been thousands of unfunded students, with all that this has meant for the quality of teaching and learning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was addressing the problem of overcrowding in universities. The Government has, of course, given its ideology, rejected the obvious answer to the problem of overcrowding. That answer is to allow the universities to create additional places and give students and industry the right to invest in those places&mdash;the traditional right that universities have always had. But the Government's answer is to force the universities, at a time of unprecedented demand, to cut back on their intakes. The number of commencing students has actually fallen as the number of students seeking entry has risen. It is 7,000 lower this year than last year. This year there are some 50,000 qualified students locked out of universities, many of whom would have gained entry in previous years. This problem shows every sign of continuing over the next few years unless effective action is taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government mouths its platitudes about equity, but what equity is there in a policy under which universities can admit 15,000 overseas students into unfunded places, with the permission of the Government, but cannot admit Australian students to similar places? This is what the Government calls central planning. It claims to have planned the increase in school retention, which it did not. Does it also claim to be planning the intakes to the universities? Did it plan the disastrous training initiatives to which I have referred?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no central plan for education in this country, nor could there be a detailed and coherent central plan given the complexity and size of the education sector. The great mistake the Government has made is believing that there could be such a plan for higher education and forcing its preferences on the system to the point where it is choking the universities in this country of resources which would otherwise be available to them, and demoralising those who are supposed to be bringing the clever country into existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is to provide the institutions with the freedom and the flexibility to address the problems. There is nothing very radical about this; it simply means restoring to the universities their traditional freedoms to decide what courses they will teach, to whom they will teach them, the terms on which they will admit students, and the terms on which they will employ staff. These proposals are, of course, frightening to the powerful bureaucratic and union interests for whom the present policies are designed because they mean that power will return to the academics and to the universities and empty away from the central supervisory and regulatory agencies these interests have so painstakingly put in place. So for the next few months until the election we will hear the most irresponsible scare talk about how it is impossible to give the universities back their freedom because this would be incompatible with the interests of working class Australians who would be shut out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fraudulence of such claims needs to be exposed. The 50,000 students shut out of universities will be overwhelmingly students from less advantaged backgrounds. The correlation between tertiary entrance scores and educational background makes this certain. Under a freer system there will be more places, because a Hewson government will fund at least as many places as the Government proposes to fund directly, and will also restore the rights of Australian students to provide their own funding for additional places. Many will get industry sponsorships, others will work to put themselves through, and the money available for scholarships to provide free places to talented poor students will expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has abandoned its traditional supporters. They are the ones paying the price of the Fawlty Towers system of university regulation the Government has put in place. They will be the major beneficiaries of a better funded system with more places and more scholarships. Out of the chaos caused by this Government, of course, quality has been the victim. But the Government has an answer to that. It will set up  committees to give an assurance of quality: when in doubt, set up a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For schools it has set up the so-called national project on the quality of teaching and learning. This is a committee of employer and union representatives. It is the kind of committee beloved of this Government. It excludes the parents and the community, but they have never been favoured participants in the Government's corporate state. The main work of this committee&mdash;the national project&mdash;seems to be to provide the Australian Teachers Federation and other unions with a cover under which they can hijack the move towards teacher professionalism through supporting an Australian teaching council dominated by the unions and interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a body can never promote teacher professionalism in any real sense because a professional body must be, above all, concerned with standards and must be prepared to act when standards are not maintained. A professional body should be representative and be led by outstanding teachers, and not dominated by the industrial relations agenda. But a real professional body might challenge the grip of the unions, and that cannot be allowed to happen in Labor's world, even at the cost of setting back the professional advancement of teachers for a decade. So little is the Australian Teaching Council being seen as a genuine professional body for teachers that it is even being debated whether teachers will have a majority on it. I am sure that the significance of this fact will not be lost on teachers around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the issue of quality in the universities. Ah, the Government has a solution to that one too: set up another committee, this time called the quality assurance mechanism. This committee will give out money to the universities which use their resources best. By what criteria? Ah, this causes more than a slight problem. It is coming up to a year since the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) announced this initiative. We are still waiting to see the criteria. There are no satisfactory criteria which can be administered by such a committee. The criteria of quality relate to the quality of the degrees which the university issues and the quality of its research. One can be quite sure that these will not be the dominant criteria when they are eventually published. The whole concept is a nonsense concept, and instead of pretending that it is viable the Government should abandon it and put the money to some more useful end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the Prime Minister's admission that Australia faces a training emergency. According to the latest report of the Auditor-General, this emergency extends right into the Department of Employment, Education and Training itself.

His interest is not in solving problems but in servicing them to meet the political needs of the day.

It is certainly incorrect to say that the Government has forgotten its traditional supporters. Anybody who has been a student of employment, education and training policies in this country would know and note that the Government has improved the opportunities available to every person in Australia in the education system and has also made sure that more places are available for people to take up, as well as improving Austudy, which obviously helps people from lower socio-economic backgrounds.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a very important aspect of the Government's approach, and one which I am very proud that we have taken. Certainly it cannot be said that a person&mdash;for instance, a supporting parent&mdash;is now being encouraged to stay on a pension. Such people are being encouraged, on the other hand, to take up a position in the work force or to pursue education to improve their position so that, when their children are older&mdash;say, age 16&mdash;if they want to go into the work force they will have the skills to do so. That offer, that opportunity, is being accompanied by assistance from the Government in terms of child-care, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute nonsense for the honourable member for Goldstein to make those comments about the Government's employment, education and training programs. I wanted to point that out to the House, although it was not meant to be the primary part of my speech. I would also point out that under Jobstart we have an improved situation where more money is being paid to employers to employ people who have been out of work for a considerable time. They will be subsidised in their employment for up to 26 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, both in my own and other electorates, we have a particularly good scheme which has been assisted by DEET where BP, a national company, has undertaken to train people to work as forecourt attendants in service stations. This is a new area of employment for people. It is a return to some of the old value systems where people expect to get service for money. The petrol station proprietors acknowledge that they have been losing custom because of self-service. People have been coming into the service stations, getting the petrol themselves and driving on through without anybody checking their water, their oil, the air in their tyres or their batteries. That is an opportunity lost for the small business person concerned, the operator of the service station, in trying to assist that customer to buy something from the service station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe BP has taken a laudable step in this direction, with the assistance of the Federal Government through Jobtrain and Jobstart. I might stress that this scheme has been aimed not just at young people but people up to the age of 45 and over, and they have been getting these jobs. After five weeks of training these people have a guaranteed job for 12 months in the forecourt of a service station in Western Australia. The service station proprietor chooses the person that he or she wants for the job. If they are able to prove themselves, then in a year's time, with the economy picking up, there is a very strong chance that that job will remain on the service station's books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to say that BP is going on to start a console operators course so that people who previously may have had little experience with computers are now able to train on them. They can then try to get a job in the computing area of a service station in order to be able to assist with stocks and so on. Both Jobstart and Jobtrain are good schemes. I think that the honourable member for Goldstein was underestimating the Government's commitment towards trying to get people into work and also keep people in work.

This Government is not proposing anything of that kind. On the contrary, this Government is proposing a policy of continued support for and expansion of Austudy for students. It also means that people in receipt of Austudy will have the opportunity to take out a loan of up to $2,000. This is traded in as part of their Austudy in order to expand the student's resources during the period of study. That loan will be paid back in the same way as under the HECS arrangements. In other words, when their income reaches the average weekly earnings point, they start to pay it back through the tax system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget has some very important, compassionate and caring aspects. I would like to concentrate my remarks on the areas of health, housing and community services, albeit I have already made some comments on employment, education and training. To begin, the 1992-93 Budget provides a $93m package of assistance to carers. I would point out to honourable members that at the moment I am wearing an `I Support Carers' badge. This has been provided to many members of the Government, but I assume that members of the Opposition would also be able to obtain them. These are badges that people can wear to show that they support carers during this carers week. This is a very important week because carers are a under-recognised resource in our community. Without these people, we would be up for a lot of money. We would be a less compassionate society if we did not have people in the community who are prepared to put themselves out to assist members of their family and their friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is National Carers Awareness Week. Carers provide care and support for a parent, partner, child or friend who has a disability, who is frail or who suffers from dementia or a chronic illness. It is an unfortunate fact that many carers experience a deterioration in their own health as a consequence of the physical, mental and emotional strain occasioned by long term care of someone else. It is imperative that the Government act to diminish these stresses and strains in every way possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all honourable members are no strangers to situations in their own electorates where an elderly person is helping their partner and they are suffering physical hardship as a consequence of lifting that person in and out of bed and so on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a lot to do with people suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that this illness has occurred mostly in the eastern States, especially in New South Wales, but we also have a large number of sufferers in Western Australia. These people could not exist without carers. It is a sad fact that many families or partners are unable to withstand the rigours which those sorts of problems cause. It often ends up with a breakup of the marriage, which is a very sad thing. What the Government is intending to do for carers will help many people in those situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carers deserve our thanks and our support. They need recognition and assistance in their essential role. Accordingly, the Government has proclaimed its commitment to carers in a statement released recently.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be understood that the Opposition's proposed cutbacks in government services and spending would cut the heart out of areas such as community services and inevitably would result in even more responsibility and work being thrown on carers and other compassionate volunteers in the community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsible government cannot and must not avoid its obligation to provide assistance to those in the community who cannot look after themselves.

Government must also assist carers in every way possible, including the arrangement of respite care wherever reasonably required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government genuinely cares for carers. The Budget includes the following welcome improvements in this regard: the domiciliary nursing care benefit will be increased by $5 per week to $26 per week from January 1993. It will also be indexed to ensure it keeps pace with increases in the cost of living. Care can be interrupted for up to 42 days a year without affecting eligibility. Carers will benefit from the injection of an extra $40m to expand existing respite services. Almost $5m will be available to improve information and support for carers. This will include a carers kit with information about available services and how to access them, together with material on financial, legal and health issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carers pension will be increased by $6 per fortnight in January 1993. Education and part time employment opportunities are to be enhanced and promoted by allowing carers up to 10 weeks for training, employment or education and access to the JET scheme.

I am very pleased to note that the Budget Bills being debated tonight include an allocation of $135m over the next six years to meet the Government's commitment to implement a national mental health policy in conjunction with the States. This policy will see a major expansion in community based care and acute care facilities in mainstream hospitals, improving care for people affected while enabling the progressive closure of substandard institutions. The national mental health policy will result in a marked change in mental health care, focusing on consumer rights and improved service provision. The package of measures announced in the Budget will increase significantly the range and quality of community services available to assist people with mental health problems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UT4">Mr NUGENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I would just like to pick up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen). I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by some of her comments because they were less than accurate. The honourable member for Cowan referred to, for example, the jobs for the petrol station attendants that BP Australia Ltd is organising and so on&mdash;which, I have to say, is a good scheme. I remind her that it was her Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who not many weeks ago in this place was pouring great buckets over the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for suggesting the creation of just such jobs. It seems to me that there is a fair degree of hypocrisy in those statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to the honourable member for Cowan that the Government does not have a monopoly on care and compassion. I may not be wearing a badge, but if she cares to come down to my office on Friday afternoon she can have tea with the several hundred people, carers from my electorate, who will be coming in to mark the same occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have to challenge her on the statement that the coalition would cut the heart out of the carers area. That is absolutely untrue. If she reads <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> she will find that there are extra funds directed specifically at those sorts of service deliveries. Where we are going to cut funding is very much in the bureaucracy; but we are going to put the money at the sharp end where we need to deliver the services. She should look at the detail of the policy and not just believe some of the rantings of her Prime Minister in this place on occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous speakers from this side have dealt extensively with the broad measures in the Budget, so I do not propose to go over them in great detail. I want to make a few quick general comments. I want to talk specifically about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elements of the Budget because I take a special interest in that area, being the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and being a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation&mdash;in fact, the only member of this chamber on that Council. I also want to develop in depth some thoughts in the area of industry, particularly in science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms it would be fair to say, from talking extensively around my electorate, that the Budget is a non-event for the average man in the street. It caused a currency crisis when it first came out. It borrows heavily to provide some bandaid measures, and it ignores, for short term political benefits, the fundamental change necessary in this country. It is really all about not offending some people's mates. It increases our debt substantially and will have a marginal impact on the long term unemployment situation. In terms of doing good things for the people in my electorate, it very much leaves them out altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Aston in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne there are no local government capital grants whatsoever. There is minuscule road or housing funding. There is no help for business. The threat when the Budget came down of an increase in interest rates has become an actuality&mdash;and this in an electorate which has more mortgage payers than any other electorate in this country. I have the mortgage belt of Australia in my electorate, and what we are seeing is interest rates starting to go up. It seems to me that there is great inequity in terms of the way my unemployed residents are treated compared with many others. A 45-year-old unemployed man with a wife and three children is just as deserving if he lives in my area as one who lives in some other area. Under the scheme that this Government has brought down, he is being ignored totally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that we must recognise the impact of the world economy and the recession. But 10 years under this Prime Minister as either Treasurer or Prime Minister show that he does not have the answers in any shape or form. What the Government should have been doing is to bring down a reduction in business costs so that businesses can get up and working and start to employ people again. It should have been attacking the issues of the costs of things such as electricity. It should be doing away with payroll tax and attacking the problems with Workcare, petroleum excise and so on. We need a reduction in government interference in business, yet the trend is in the other direction, with more and more forms to fill in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be looking at competition, to get prices down and better service&mdash;not monopolies&mdash;in the public and private sector, in so many areas whether transport, communications, power generation or whatever. We need some incentives for individuals to save, to invest and to work&mdash;not the present system where so much of what we earn goes in tax. We need to wean people away from the handout or welfare mentality. Of course, all of those things are in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about some of the specifics in this Budget. Firstly, I want to talk about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander area. As I have said, I take a special interest in that. I have no intention of making this area a political football because I think there is broad support for what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points I would like to make briefly. Firstly, I say to the Government&mdash;and I am sure I will have the wholehearted support of the coalition in this&mdash;that it has done well to spend money as a result of the recommendations of the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal Commission, but it is important that it continue to press the States, of whichever political persuasion, to make their contribution as well. It seems to me that a number of the States, of all political persuasions, are avoiding that issue. I think it is something that they should not be allowed to get away with. They are running for cover and they have to be made to stand up and face their share of the responsibility as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a need to prune some of the bureaucracy which is eating up so much of the Budget allocation in this area. There are too many consultants and bureaucrats, and not enough of the money that has been allocated to the Aboriginal and Torres Islander area is actually getting out to the sharp end for the delivery of services. Thirdly, I am pleased that the Government has chosen to fund the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in this Budget for the first time. The Council actually asked for somewhat more than it received. It had a 20 per cent reduction on its original request. That will mean that in this very important area we will be forced to cut back some of the planned activity. I think that is to be regretted. The Council's strategic plan will be presented in this place shortly. Obviously, that will be the time to comment on it in much more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to devote some time to talking about industry and innovation. I want to talk about Australia's situation and some of the options facing us today. I will make some general points up-front. Firstly, we need to look at what I would call the technology pull, because of the failure of technology push in this country. For far too long, through R&amp;D, the academic world and others have come up with some very clever ideas and have tried to sell them off to industry. It has not worked. Nobody has wanted to pick up those ideas. We really should be looking at getting our businessmen and our business leaders, as a matter of course, when they have a problem or a competitive need, to say to their R&amp;D people, `Here is a problem. You solve it'. When that answer comes up, they are much more likely to pick it up and implement it. That is the pull from business that we need, rather than just pushing out a few ideas from academia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need application of innovation across the board. One or two bright ideas will not solve this country's problems. We need the consistent application of innovation, efficiency and technology right across the landscape of business and industry. I suggest that some of the Government's specific measures in this Budget are well-intentioned, but other things have not been addressed. I would like to remind the House of where this country stands at the moment and refer to the 1992 World Competitiveness Report. An article recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 World Competitiveness Report . . . suggests the pace of micro-economic reform and the internationalisation of the Australian economy is not moving fast enough.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although in the past Australia has had a variety of strengths and weaknesses compared to other nations, the latest report suggests the nation has many weaknesses and only average strengths.</PARA>

<PARA>These are not my views; this is an international competitive report that looks at the whole world. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a range of government policies are holding back Australia's competitiveness. Although Government fiscal and monetary policies are generally favourable, the legislative and regulatory environment are a drawback&mdash;especially in terms of environmental protection, improper practices and government efficiency and transparency.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's exports are heavily concentrated in energy (coal and oil), agriculture (wool and wheat), mining and basic metals. But these are the areas of world trade which are either declining or growing at slow rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, in areas such as metal products, chemicals, wood and paper, textiles, food and building products (where world trade is growing the fastest), Australia is only a small player and only a small part of its exports are found in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA>So what has the Government given us? The Government's science and technology White Paper, for example, tells us that the key to developing `a nation that is internationally competitive and environmentally responsible' is to generate business enthusiasm for applying research findings to increase wealth. To achieve this, the Government has revoked its original plan to cut the 150 per cent business research and development tax concession and will retain it, as it is, `indefinitely'. Would it not be better to relieve business costs across the board and cut payroll tax for everybody, as well as Workcare and those other things I mentioned earlier? Why do we have to just pick out some companies? Surely we would get more value from cutting across the board those business input costs, and it would be far less difficult to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is to waive the $10m limit on pilot plants purchased or built after 19 August and has reversed an earlier intention to slash support for rural research&mdash;a move in the right direction, but hardly a major initiative. The Government plans to create three new advanced engineering centres to bind public research and private industry more closely in an innovation chain. This probably is a good idea, but surely it is still tied to the concept of government involvement and science push when what is really needed is the commercial pull about which I spoke earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is to provide $4.9m to get the Australian magnesium metal R&amp;D project off the ground and revamp the Prime Minister's Science Council to include engineering and, heaven forbid, to include the Federal Treasurer as a member of the Science Council. I would have thought that there were enough government Ministers on that Council as it was. The Government is to set up a special office to commercialise defence science and has funded its science commercialisation agency, the Australian Technology Group, which has not really distinguished itself in glory in the short time in which it has been in existence, through a one-off payment of $30m. Again, this is all more government involvement in business operations. Why not pass it to the private sector, whose very job it is to run business and make a profit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has announced a new scheme to link Australian firms to overseas partners to acquire international  know-how. It is another contrived scheme, but at least it is a move in the right direction. There is a crying need in this country to get technological transfer into the country and to learn from what goes on overseas. There is, equally, and in some senses more importantly, a need to have those international relationships so that we can take advantage of the international distribution channels for our products going overseas. It is very hard for a company in this country to go overseas and set up the mechanisms and all the infrastructure and the costs that take such a long time to get established. We need those international distribution channels, so those linkages are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has also said that he will launch a genetic manipulation authority to get the biotechnology industry up and running, and he has offered to provide seed funding for a food technology innovation association. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology&mdash;which recently completed an 18-month report of 300-odd pages with 50-odd recommendations into genetic engineering in this country&mdash;I certainly welcome this move, but I would also be interested to know when the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) will respond to the recommendations we made in that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major thrust of the Government's White Paper lay in the restoration of some of the nation's science infrastructure, which was run down over the 1980s. A total of $30.6m is provided over two years to upgrade assets in government research agencies. CSIRO receives $12m of this, although I have to say that it asked for $20m. It is perhaps noteworthy that this Government had allowed CSIRO capital spending to sink below the level of the last year of the Fraser Government until only this last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other measures, of course. I could go on but time precludes that. We have had for far too long the fast buck mentality in industry, research and development, technology and innovation, the areas that I take a particular interest in. This Government has compounded the problem by adopting short term re-election stances. I suggest that the blueprint for advancing our industry, which means the take-up of innovation across the board, as I said earlier, requires a number of fundamental steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Starting at the bottom, we need to re-educate our work force and perhaps put much more emphasis on technology and innovation for our children at school. We should be using our purchasing clout, such as it is, to require multinationals to make long term investments here. We should be playing to our strengths in industry clusters&mdash;not individual winner picking, but using our natural advantages. We should be educating our business leaders in what is possible by way of technology to help solve their problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the sort of better business climate provided by Fightback: $20 billion taken off the back of businesses to help them be more competitive, to help them grow and to help them create those important jobs. We need better depreciation and investment incentives for business, and we need to wean business away from the short term property speculator mentality over to the longer term innovation investment mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I have a jaundiced view of the Budget. Mainly it is short term measures. Debt has increased yet again. We have, of course, seen an incredible increase in debt during the lifetime of this Government. It took us 193 years to get to $23 billion; it has taken us another 10 to get that figure up to something like $180 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No real jobs are created in this Budget at all; they are all short term measures. Locally, in my electorate of Aston, the unemployed are in as much need as they are anywhere else. I am one of only four Federal electorates in the State of Victoria that do not get a red cent. None of my three municipalities get a thing. Do not tell me that is because we do not have a big enough unemployment problem. We may have started off with a lower base, but we have had an over 600 per cent increase in unemployment in the last 10 years. People are bleeding in my area just as much as they are anywhere else, and they are entitled to support and help the same as everybody else. But they have been ignored by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I certainly support the thrust of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander elements of the Budget. I dislike many of the science and technology elements. In a sentence, I have to say that this Budget fails to achieve most of what is required for this nation and for its people to prosper. I urge the House to condemn it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I close, I would like to say one other thing very briefly. In Question Time last Thursday the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition is espousing policies which would see major companies desist from major investment in the motor vehicle industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He named me, amongst a number of other coalition members, as being well aware that our policies would wipe out these industries. He implied quite clearly that we were not happy with that. I have to say to the Prime Minister and those opposite that that is untrue. I have certainly never made that sort of statement. Under the Labor Party's administration, companies in my electorate are already voting with their feet and going overseas. Tariffs are not the only issue. We have had a lot of argument recently about tariffs, but there are other things that we will do that the Government will not do which will help business tremendously. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In 1992, we have double digit unemployment, which is not good enough, but we also have almost no inflation. I will speak about that a little later.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, it is no higher now than it was in 1983. We need to face a number of challenges. We certainly need to face the challenge of more equipment, more robots and more computers taking the place of people. We need to face the challenge of how we will share the work. Here we have the problem of competing with countries that are paying low wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to face the challenge of hours of work. That is happening already; more and more people are working part time. We have to face the challenge of optional retirement. That is also being faced right throughout Australia. I congratulate the Government on moving towards optional retirement, particularly through superannuation, and giving people the opportunity to retire from the age of 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston spoke about local government community projects. I did not receive very much in my electorate either for these projects, because my electorate has lower unemployment than many areas of Australia. For instance, one area which received an allocation was Eurobodalla Shire, which recently had 15.6 per cent unemployment. Areas which did not receive it included Yarrowlumla Shire, which had 2.3 per cent unemployment. So it was based on submissions by local government and shires associations and by the Government itself. The Government wedded the ideas of both sides to come up with the program of local government community projects. Just because the Government did not pork-barrel, it does not mean that it will not be an effective project. It will be more effective because of that. This is why the electorate of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), for instance, received funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge to unemployment is not only in the area of creating jobs; it is also in looking at education&mdash;education so that we can help people bridge that gap between the relatively high number of unemployed people and the relatively high number of jobs which are available to people with the right skills and the right education, if only they could get these attributes. This is why the moves that are made in the Budget to combat literacy and numeracy problems and to help through the $60m school capital works program some of those schools that have aged and not had an upgrading of facilities for many years are long overdue. All these things will benefit education and assist students to become employable more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Mrs Margaret Whitlam on the work she did with the Australian Language and Literacy Council, touring Australia and inspiring people to seek more funds to help improve literacy and numeracy. This will make a tremendous difference. It will mean that people who have been moving out into the work force without knowing their numbers, without being literate, will no longer feel like drop-outs and feel the low self-esteem that people have at the moment. There will be a big difference, I believe, in the way in which students move out into the community and their readiness for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job creation programs are important too. They are important for jobs; they are important because people see the work they are doing as important; and they are important because they are doing some very important works in the community. For instance, the water projects at Mogo, Bermagui, Nimmitabel and Captains Flat have assisted people to get good clean water when they did not have it before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dune care has helped many thousands of hectares of coastal Australia via job creation projects in the soil conservation area. Sand is no longer blowing away, no longer being washed out to sea, no longer being subject to widespread erosion. We have seen a lot of growth along our coastal areas simply because of the projects to care for some of the dune areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a wide range of projects, for instance, underground power lines in Cooma. Job creation projects do have long term benefits. The work being done by the Government in tourism will be of great benefit. The Snowy Mountains and coastal areas of south-eastern New South Wales and the historic towns in this area, as well as in other parts of Australia, will benefit from 80,000 new jobs in tourism&mdash;simply because of the successful promotion overseas of Australia as a tourist area. Now that tourism has passed all our commodities in terms of its value to Australia as an export industry, we ought to be taking it seriously. We should no longer be dismissing it as something that is temporary and that will not last forever. Paul Hogan did great work overseas in his advertising. Greg Norman did great work overseas. Now there is to be a new impetus with more sophisticated and direct advertising, particularly to some of the people of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is good reason for confidence, as long as we are not tied to any of the `isms'&mdash;as long as we are not tied, for instance, to economic rationalism as a major reason for our successes. Economic rationalism has contributed to our success, but no `ism' is sacred. Humans are fallible, and so are their doctrines. Capitalism gave us growth, but it also gave us child labour and slavery. Communism gave us new insights into cooperation; it also gave us inefficiency and totalitarianism. Fascism gave us racism, persecution and dictatorships; but even fascism gave us constructive ideas about government intervention into industry. Economic rationalism gave us leaner government, more efficient industries and balanced Budgets. I draw that to the attention of those on this side of the House who deny those benefits. But it would also give us, if allowed to go unleashed, soup kitchens, homelessness and social chaos. Anyone who has visited the United States recently would have seen some of that social chaos in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's governments need to be concerned about the economy. They need to give attention, as well, to interhuman justice and to environmental sustainability. That is the difference between Labor and the coalition. Labor will give more attention to interhuman justice and environmental sustainability. It certainly will not be tied to the doctrine of economic rationalism. Neither would the National Party subscribe to this, except that it is the tail of the Liberal dog. That is its problem. Therefore, it is tied to economic rationalism. That is why honourable members opposite will be very embarrassed as we challenge them on Telecom and on Australia Post&mdash;when we challenge their intentions in regard to some of these great local country services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, 10 years of a Labor government has seen a couple of mistakes. For instance, lack of control of bank lending may have been a mistake&mdash;when we saw people shuffling paper and making money but eventually coming a thud&mdash;forcing interest rates up at a time when commodity prices were dropping. There could have been more control of bank lending. Interest rates were perhaps not increased quickly enough. Those increases could have taken place in 1988; it could have been done earlier. There have been mistakes, but there have been some great successes. In spite of what the honourable member for Aston said, under Labor there have been a number of Budget surpluses which have made history in Australia. If we compare them with the achievement of any other government we will not see the level of Federal Budget surpluses that we have had here in Australia. They have stood us in good stead. We have not often been in the black. That means that the Government can go into deficit now with confidence in itself and the confidence of those who know the Government's record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some excellent Ministers. We have seen tariffs drop. I believe that we should not go back on those. We should not wipe the advantages that we have had from lower tariffs. Neither should we wipe the tariffs altogether because they have given us some great benefits. Certainly, whenever we talk to the Japanese about rice&mdash;the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) mentioned this today&mdash;they say, `What would we have done in World War II if we had not had our own food, if we had not had rice?'. For similar sorts of reasons we need to have a car industry, a clothing industry and a footwear industry. It would be wrong to allow those industries to go because, if we are to retain our independence and not be dependent on the industries of other countries, we need to have basic industries here in Australia. While I would urge the Government not to go back and increase tariffs, I also urge it not to wipe out tariffs entirely, as the Opposition would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a great record in health. In fact, our health system, in a very difficult world, is a very good one&mdash;one of the best. It may well be the best. I can recall an economics expert who works in business coming to one of the Government's policy committee meetings and mentioning that we ought to be selling our health system and our education system to other countries. Our health system is the best in a world that is finding it very difficult to cope with health costs. We can now spend a lot of money just to keep people alive. Should we be doing it? Archbishop George of Adelaide said only yesterday that it is now so expensive to keep people alive that we ought to look at the ethics of doing so. It is also expensive to treat people. Someone can go into a pharmacy or a hospital pharmacy or have ordered a prescription that is worth $2,700. The Government pays that, and the patient pays $15. That person does not always know how much it costs. So we need to continue this debate on where we are going with health expenditure. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that we maintain our lifestyle. For all the criticism of the Victorian Government, just recently Melbourne was awarded fourth position in the world for lifestyle values. It was in the top four in the world. It is true: if we go to Victoria we find that the roads are better, transport is better, and health and community services are better.

At that time agriculture was over 30 per cent of our economy. It is now down to just over five per cent. Mining has gradually increased in value to the Australian economy. But neither is occupying the proportion of the Australian economy that they once did. Australia cannot expect to rank as high when areas of income on which we depended for so many years are no longer quite as reliable in terms of economic return as they once were. </PARA>

If we were to ask which racial sector of the world is in the most confused state, we would probably look at the former communist states and find that they are in a confused state. But we could also look at the English speaking countries such as Britain, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It is true that we have become arrogant over years of being on top. Now comes the inevitable demise when we choke on the lassitude, the arrogance, the careless mistakes, the assumption that the world owes us a living&mdash;which very often follow world dominance.

There is great reason for confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget contains a number of measures for farmers and businesses in country areas. I can think of Landcare, the income equalisation deposits and the farm bonds that are associated with them. There are a couple of things that we need to remember. One is that farmers and businesses should not fall for Fightback. It is not only the paperwork that is involved, where they will have to tally everything that is sold and deduct from it everything that is bought, that will not help businesses and farmers. It will also have an effect on low wages. The performance is less when wages are lower because there is less spending in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the fuel confusion. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned it today. Those opposite tell us that they will deduct 19c off petrol prices and, in the same breath, that the user will pay for roads. How? They have not explained it. We can only assume that they will find that $17,000 in the form of a registration charge or that they will tell the States to charge at the bowser. They should be telling us. The Prime Minister made it quite clear today that, after taking into account what those opposite have said, there will be $17,000 a year more in registration charges for vehicles. What will happen to car drivers, including pensioners and people such as that? Will they get a huge registration charge once a year? If the user pays, those opposite will be looking somewhere for most of that 19c. The Opposition will now be tackled by this Government day after day. Where is that user-pays money for roads coming from? We want to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great advantages that this Government, farmers and businesses have at the moment is low inflation and a relatively low dollar. What has happened in the last few months with the dollar, interest rates and low inflation could mean $5,000 more for every farm household or $5,000 less on their debt&mdash;and I know that quite a few of them are in debt. It will be a $5,000 advantage to farmers. The drop in inflation reduces farm costs and business costs and helps management. It is a tremendous advantage to anyone in business, particularly for farmers who cannot price their goods, and they have always been in that difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason for a positive attitude within Australia is the fact that there may well be a world recovery. Much depends on Japan and Germany. Just today Germany has made a decision on lower interest rates which could have very good ramifications. It has already had ramifications in the markets today. Much depends on world trade improving. More importantly, much depends on working towards economically, ecologically sustainable usage of our resources. It is particularly important that we get that balance right. In one sense, to use a hackneyed term, we are borrowing these times from our children and what we do today will be very important to our children and our grandchildren in the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another positive move has come from getting tariffs down. As I said, it has resulted in enormous efficiency in our industry. Farmers do well out of cheaper equipment and machinery charges and they have a vested interest in promoting low tariffs throughout the world. They also recognise that we do not want to walk away from important industries, such as the car industry, which must remain part of our economy if we are not to become dependent on other countries. As has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), there are a great many things for retired people and wages policy. I believe that when it comes to a vote no-one will vote to pay higher prices in shops and no-one will vote for lower wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the impact of the Budget on country people, farm viability, town employment and the quality of life of people who live in regional Australia. The starting point is the depressed situation in rural and regional Australia where, in the financial year just ended, most farmers had the lowest incomes ever on record. It reached its worst point with broad acre farmers&mdash;that is, the graziers&mdash;with a minus $44,000 net farm income. There will be an improvement this year, but not by a great amount. The western division of New South Wales, which is 42 per cent of the State, and parts of western Queensland have the worst drought they have had in many years. Cash income has fallen 55 per cent and the average debt in those areas is over $400,000 per farm. If we look beyond the farm, we see that there are above average levels of unemployment throughout regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depressing news in the Budget&mdash;this was quickly picked up by people in rural Australia&mdash;is that there is no long term hope for improving farm viability, employment or quality of life. There is no strategy; there is nothing that they can look to in the future to improve their situation. When we look at the Budget deficit&mdash;and this is very significant with regard to the interest payments that are necessary with those levels of debt&mdash;we see that it is already projected officially at $13.4 billion. Independent commentators put it at $21 billion. That compares with the Budget last year when the starting point was officially $4.7 billion and it blew out to $9.9 billion by the end of the year. So who knows what the final Budget deficit figure will be. Already there is pressure on interest rates to move up again with that deficit level and that, in turn, will have pressure on inflation. That is a very significant cost to country people when we consider those average debt levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is also projecting income tax cuts to try to match those of the coalition in Fightback. But because the Government has that deficit level, it is obvious that it will have to increase taxes somewhere if it is to have any credibility with its personal income tax proposals. Therefore, there is this question of hidden taxes on the agenda by the Government. In an answer by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in Parliament last week in response to this question of extending the prescribed payments system to the taxi, tourism and fishing industries, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have said that we will tell you in due course, sooner rather than later.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he has not denied that there will be the extensions of those taxes to those industries&mdash;they were all mentioned in Question Time&mdash;and, beyond them, to other rural industries with the impact that will have on cash flow. Has there been any recognition in the Budget of the short term problems facing farmers, particularly as this is the worst income year ever? In spite of it being the worst year ever, expenditure in primary industry is down $97.8m. The Budget figures reveal that, in broad terms, primary industry received $1,760m, but that includes $774m of the farmers' own money for the payment on their research levies and so forth and $438m on the diesel rebate. The allocation for primary industry was $551.7m, which, as I said, is down $97.8m. So there is no great hope in the Budget for farmers in the short term or in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some problems in agriculture are unable to be solved by government, such as natural disasters&mdash;particularly the drought at present&mdash;and corrupt world trade. But country people do judge a government on what it can do to alleviate these problems. This Government has removed drought, even severe drought, from the natural disaster arrangements. It has put it in the catch-all of rural adjustment and, as there is already a budgetary limit on the rural adjustment scheme, there will not be too much assistance for drought. With corrupt world trade and access to markets, the point is being made repeatedly by the coalition that, for the last 10 years, the Government has put all its faith in the GATT round of multilateral negotiations and turned its back on better bilateral access, whether it be for agricultural or other products that we export. In countries such as Malaysia, Taiwan, the PRC and Indonesia, there is example after example of restrictions against our products which this Government has done nothing to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall impact of a government on a community&mdash;and I am talking here of the rural and regional community&mdash;is not restricted to one Budget. It is on record that over the past 10 years the Government has systematically transferred government assistance and resources out of regional Australia, whether it has been on roads, tax incentives or the new assets test, which was unfair in equity terms for education and welfare. Those rural industries with tariff assistance had those tariffs reduced without at the same time micro-economic reforms being put in place to provide competitiveness. The dumping and countervailing procedures against those unfair practices were made softer rather than tougher at a time of corrupt world trade. This made it hard for many of our import industries. Then year in year out there was the relentless increase in taxes on inputs, particularly in the form of fuel tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done these things, but sometimes governments recognise that they have made mistakes and do something to redress the balance. What about this Budget? Has the Government recognised any of these errors? Certainly the Government has put some one-off payments into drought relief&mdash;$14m into both Queensland and New South Wales&mdash;but it has not made the decision that it should have taken to put drought or severe drought back into the natural disaster arrangements. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is talking about arranging seminars on risk management for farmers. How realistic is it for someone who is on a nice safe salary, whether in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne or Canberra, trying to tell a Mallee wheat grower about risk management. When one considers the combination of corrupt world trade, government inputs increasing growers' costs of production, and the effects of the weather and the soil, I cannot think of anybody in Australia who is now more adept at risk management than a Mallee wheat grower. In my view, the present position is absurd. It would be better if more practical forms of assistance were provided for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the rural adjustment changes that are still to be completely announced. There will be even less flexibility under the new arrangements than there was in the past, particularly in relation to corrupt world trade&mdash;which, for example, could apply to wheat because of the EEP subsidy proposals of the United States. Following one or two years of a wheat war, an otherwise viable wheat grower might not be able to match rigid criteria because of the lack of flexibility. I hope the Government will recognise special situations where criteria have to be flexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The household support arrangement for farmers at the bottom end of the income scale&mdash;that is, those who need money to put groceries on the table&mdash;is still unfair compared to the rest of Australia. Basically it is still a loan arrangement. The Government said it would overcome this problem by bringing in some special arrangements under Jobsearch for unemployment benefits. When Jobsearch was announced in December last year, the Government indicated that about 5,000 people would qualify. The rural community said, `Well, that is not adequate. The figure needs to be more than that'. But since that scheme commenced nine months ago, not 5,000, or 4,000, or 3,000, or 2,000, or 1,000 have actually qualified. As of Budget day, 672 had applied and only 285 had obtained any assistance under the scheme that was supposed to overcome those problems. </PARA>

If the Government had retained a decent IED scheme, there would not have been quite the call that there is now for government assistance, because there would have been self-insurance by the rural community.

For example, we are told that $74m will be provided this year for these schemes. According to the Budget, that is a big increase on last year. If we go back to last year's Budget Papers, the Government was to allocate $71m but spent only $60m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sleight of hand. In relation to regional employment and the problem of high unemployment in regional Australia, the Government has announced for this year its $250m scheme with local government. Local government is a most appropriate group to administer that type of assistance. I acknowledge that in my electorate all 19 councils qualify and that approximately $5m will be provided. But those local councils say they have a dilemma. If they go back to an employment arrangement such as the old red scheme&mdash;having supervisors, having the unemployed and not being able to provide facilities at good cost benefits and/or of long term value to the community&mdash;they will face the dilemma or the choice of using private contractors. In that way there will be a better cost benefit delivery, where facilities of long term benefits will be provided, but as a result of which basically no-one who is presently unemployed will be employed. I acknowledge that in some cases it will mean that some who were to lose their jobs will maintain those jobs, but very few unemployed will be employed. The overall point for regional Australia is that there is no substitute for genuine jobs through a more competitive Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing for me or anyone else in the coalition to criticise the Government and its policies; it is another thing for us to say what we would do. We are in a very strong position with regard to policy. The goods and services tax element of Fightback alone means $1 billion in cost savings for Australian farmers. Where there is corrupt world trade, it is difficult in the short term to increase the price farmers receive, but their viability is determined by price minus cost. It is mainly government that has put on those costs and it is government that can remove them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Treasury, there will be a cost saving each year of $1 billion, or an average of $8,000 per commercial farmer; $1.3 billion for the food processing industry; $670m for the timber industry; and $1.1 billion for the road transport industry. According to work carried out by the independent consultants ACIL and also by Treasury, farm families will be better off throughout their income scale because they are part of farm business to start with. Secondly, petrol for private motoring will be considerable cheaper. Thirdly, family allowances will be bigger and better. There will be the most generous form of assistance for those with private health insurance; and, particularly important to country people on low income levels, the income tax threshold will be increased. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have a far quicker and tougher policy on fair trade than the Government. We are committed to bilateral, hard-nosed negotiations with other countries. We will provide resource security for forestry. We will make those improvements to the labour market which will mean that no longer will it cost twice as much to slaughter a steer or a sheep in Australia as it does in an abattoir in New Zealand or the United States.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in the cynical politics of this Government with regard to country policies and people, there is nothing more cynical than its sugar policy. Labor removed the embargo on sugar imports. Labor tried to bring in a certain tariff reduction regime, which the Opposition in the Senate slowed down. Labor broke that Senate arrangement so that as of 1 July this year it is $55 per tonne specific duty rate or about 22 per cent ad valorem. The Industry Commission has recommended that from 1 July 1998 it be a nil tariff. We have said that as part of our general tariff reduction policy, along with the textile and motor vehicle industry, the tariff will be 5 per cent in the year 2000. That is far softer than the Industry Commission report. It means that we have, in effect, rejected the Industry Commission report. Labor has not at this stage rejected the Industry Commission report on the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback will help the sugar farmer and the sugar miller, just as it will anybody else. Labor has done nothing to make coastal shipping competitive and the sugar industry in Australia faces the spectre of sugar from Thailand coming into Western Australia or South Australia cheaper than it can come in from Queensland. Labor cannot do anything about that, only the coalition can. Because of the coalition's commitment to providing greater independence for the Reserve Bank, it can guarantee lower interest rates and inflation rates, which is important for the sugar industry. We in the coalition are committed and have already announced our policy on far tougher fair trade policy than Labor has. There has been some debate about sugar imports into Australia. Australia is a very efficient producer of sugar. Therefore, with the exception of that coastal shipping problem that the industry faces under Labor, any sugar that comes into Australia will do so on an unfair or dumped basis. In that situation, the tariff level that will be there&mdash;around 15 or 20 per cent or whatever is determined at that time&mdash;will do nothing to protect the domestic sugar industry because some countries will provide export subsidies of up to 200 per cent tariff equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage Labor has given no indication that it will reject the Industry Commission report and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has indicated that not only will tariffs be in the Government's decision making over the next few months but also other elements that have traditionally been the responsibility of State governments. We will not accept the recommendations of the Courtice committee. It is a political committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I remind country people that the Cattlemen's Union passed a unanimous vote of condemnation of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) because of his failure to deliver to them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Labor's instincts, and its relationship with the broader labour movement, led it away from the worst excesses of the Reagan and Thatcher administrations.

The ALP also articulated a social justice strategy to maintain key social infrastructure such as Medicare, unemployment benefits and indexed pensions and targeted social expenditure better to ensure the ongoing viability of key income support programs which would otherwise have been at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we emerge from the 1980s, neo-conservatism worldwide looks increasingly discredited. In retrospect, the 1980s have been revealed as a decade of wasted economic opportunities in which the Bonds and the Skases rose as bubbles on a whirlpool of speculation and fortunes built not on enterprise but on deals. The economic bubble burst. The boom of the 1980s has been followed by the recession of the 1990s, and once secure administrations which had adopted neo-conservative ideas now appear on very uncertain electoral ground. </PARA>

The Liberal-National parties manifesto, Fightback, places the current Opposition unambiguously in the mainstream of 1980s neo-conservatist thinking. It proposes slashing personal income tax by about 30 per cent; reducing the top marginal rate from 49c to 42c in the dollar; introducing a 15 per cent goods and services tax; cutting the public sector by approximately $6 billion; the abandonment of the arbitration system as central to industrial relations by replacing it with individual contracts, low minimum wages and lower youth wages and the emasculation of the union movement. While everyone else, including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser who now lines up with Bill Kelty to argue against inflexible right wing ideologies, can see the harm that so-called economic racialism has wrought, Dr Hewson is unbending.

At a time when organised labour has proven itself to be as rational and as interested in improving the operation of Australian industry as anyone, the Liberal and National parties&mdash;State and Federal&mdash;are planning an unbridled attack on the working conditions of organised labour. In simple terms, the conservatives have chosen the APPM style of labour relations rather than the ANM style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania provides an interesting example of conservative thinking. In Tasmania the Liberal State Government has put forward a draft Industrial Relations Amendment (Enterprise Agreement and Workplace Freedom) Bill, which is a masterpiece of corruption of the English language. The State Government appears to be waiting until after the Federal election to have the Industrial Commission determine the new Tasmanian minimum wage. But there is no doubt that this H.R.

The States would be cut back further and the Commonwealth's own programs would be slashed. Massive job shedding, on a scale far exceeding anything seen to date, would be inevitable. Industrial confrontation, tax transfers from the least to the most well-off and job shedding&mdash;if we strip the policies of their rhetorical shells these are the neo-conservative answers for Australia's problems in the 1990s. They are not my answers, they are not the labour movement's answers and they are not this Labor Government's answers. </PARA>

It therefore knows that a simple retreat to past certainties is no longer possible.

But we remain forward looking, not backward looking, and committed to policies of change, growth and renewal&mdash;not to the repetition of past mistakes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to say a little about defence, but I have to confess that I have left my notes on defence behind. In any case, I want to begin by talking somewhat about the issue of car tariffs because that is an issue which, as a South Australian member, is close to my heart and close to the hearts of my constituents. In light of that, I thought it would be appropriate to use this debate as an opportunity to express some of my views on that issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin by saying that I do not think any reasonable person in this Parliament would ever argue that there was another member of the Parliament who did not want to see the Australian car industry prosper. Nobody in this Parliament has some sort of passionate desire to close down the car industry. I am included in that group; I want to see the car industry grow. I want to see our car industry become an international industry that we can be extremely proud of. I want to see it become one of the really rapid growth car industries of the world, and I think we in this country have the opportunity to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago the Industry Commission did quite a lot of work on the car industry. It concluded that Australia could be one of the three most competitive countries in the world in which to invest in order to manufacture passenger motor vehicles. That must be our objective; that is what we have to try to achieve. I am not a defeatist about this. I believe our car industry can do it. Fightback as a document offers the car industry a large number of very major benefits and an opportunity to move down the path of becoming internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to make the House aware of some of the data that we on this side of the House have received from people in the car industry which illustrates the point that I am making&mdash;that under Fightback very real benefits will accrue to the car industry which simply are not available under the present Government's programs. First of all, the car industry&mdash;and these are the industry's own figures, not mine&mdash;estimates that the abolition of payroll tax,  which for the industry is a very real burden given the size of the companies, would reduce the cost per car, based on a $15,000 wholesale price car, by between $350 and $400. Clearly, that represents a considerable saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax would reduce the cost of producing a car by between $150 and $220. The benefit to the industry in terms of reduced costs from abolishing fuel excise would reduce costs by between $50 and $70 per car. That clearly indicates the very substantial benefits from the tax reform aspects of Fightback alone which the car industry would obtain which simply are not offered by the Australian Labor Party. If one takes the total benefits of those three tax measures, in terms of the reduction in cost per car that would be between $550 and $690. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that the car industry puts is that the difference between the 15 per cent tariff, which is the Labor Party's tariff, and the 5 per cent tariff, which is the negligible level by the year 2000 proposed by the coalition, is in the vicinity of $1,000 per car. That means that it would be possible to import a car for $1,000 less under the coalition's proposal than it would be under the Labor Party's proposal. That disbenefit, if you like, to the car industry must be offset against the cost savings of between $550 and $690 per car as a result of the tax changes. That means that the actual net loss, to use the car industry's figures, taking just those two factors into account, is between $310 per car and $450 per car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if one were to accept those figures&mdash;and, as I will explain in a moment, we do not&mdash;the proposition that to effectively give imports a relative benefit over the position that would otherwise apply under the Labor Party of between $310 and $450 per car is hardly a difference in price which is likely to have a big impact on demand for cars. But the argument is more complicated than that. Remember that we are not going to continue with the Government's superannuation guarantee charge. We will retain what is already in place at the time of our election but we will not continue with that process, so the car industry will never end up having to pay the 9 per cent superannuation guarantee charge which is the Labor Party's policy; it will end up paying only the current charge. It is hard to work out precisely what benefit that would be per car but it might be in the vicinity of $30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I have quoted do not include any recognition of the reform to the industrial relations system that has been proposed by the coalition. We estimate that the benefits of that reform will be in the vicinity of $250 per car. So, taking the superannuation guarantee charge and the industrial relations reform into account, we are very nearly at a completely neutral position in terms of per car costs. But that still has not taken into account a range of other micro-economic reforms that the coalition is deeply committed to&mdash;waterfront reform, reform of our extremely antiquated and expensive transport system, reductions in energy costs, reductions in telecommunication costs, and so the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To take the issue of waterfront reform, it is worth remembering that both importers and exporters&mdash;car manufacturers are both of these things&mdash;have said, and this has not been disputed by the Government, that the so-called waterfront reforms under the present Government have not yielded a saving of one single dollar; they have not been helpful at all for the car industry. If one takes all of those things into account, there is no doubt that the car industry's position will, in net terms&mdash;net all of those benefits in the Fightback package and the process of micro-economic reform by the coalition&mdash;be better in terms of costs and relative costs to imports than it currently is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the debate goes a bit further than that because the Fightback package also changes the whole dimension of the economics of the demand for cars, and one has to take that into account as well. Approximately 50 per cent of all cars manufactured and sold in Australia are sold for business purposes, to business purchasers. For those particular consumers of cars&mdash;and that is around half the consumers of cars&mdash;all the Federal taxes that currently exist on those cars will be abolished. There will be no sales tax for those people any more because that will be abolished. There will be no fuel taxes on those cars either, and the GST will be fully refunded for business purchases, business inputs, which means that the cost of 50 per cent of all cars sold in Australia will be substantially reduced. Those cars will be purchased tax free, compared with the current arrangement under which they are purchased subject to sales tax. That will reduce the cost of the average business car by in the vicinity of $2,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although elasticity of demand for cars, according to the Industry Commission, is not very high, it has to be concluded that that $2,500 per car reduction in cost of purchase by businesses&mdash;I repeat, 50 per cent of all cars sold&mdash;will increase demand for cars. So too will the very substantial reduction in fuel prices brought about by the Fightback package. Remember that for ordinary consumers&mdash;that is, the 50 per cent of private motorists who buy cars&mdash;the price of petrol will reduce by 19c per litre. For businesses, the other 50 per cent of consumers of cars, the price of fuel will reduce by 26c a litre. To put it very simply, the cost of running a car will be very much cheaper than is currently the case. So the amount of money that either businesses or consumers have to devote not only to buying but to owning and running a car will be very much less than is currently the case, which I would have thought anyone could see would lead to an increase in demand for cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the car industry gets two basic benefits, a substantial reduction in costs and a substantial improvement in demand for motor vehicles which, at a time like this, I would have thought was a wonderful message for people in the car industry to hear. Car sales are at an extremely low level at the moment, and the abolition of the sales tax in particular on business cars, reducing the price of those cars by some $2,500 on average, will be a very major contributor to an improvement in demand. The point I make here is that, in contrast, the Labor Party&mdash;and indeed it has boasted it has done this&mdash;has reduced the level of protection on cars from an effective rate of 243 per cent to 15 per cent. In other words, it is in the process of overseeing an enormous reduction in tariff protection. But what has it done to reduce the burden of government costs and charges and the inhibitions to reducing the cost of producing cars? The answer is that it has done absolutely nothing. It simply has not achieved the sort of micro-economic reform which is necessary to go with those sorts of tariff reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1991 alone, the recession in particular has been responsible for the loss of some 46,682 jobs in the motor vehicle industry in Australia. There are now 66,000 jobs in car manufacturing in Australia, including the component manufacturing side, but let us remember that in 1991 alone, under Labor, 46,682 jobs were lost in the car industry. What gall those opposite have, accusing this side of politics of not wanting to retain jobs in the car industry when they themselves have thrown so many people out of work in that extremely important industry for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last issue I want to raise is why some of the car manufacturers are concerned about this process of reducing tariffs. I am not entirely unsympathetic to their concerns because in years gone by, and in particular over the past 10 years, manufacturers have been told they will have to face reductions in tariffs but government has done nothing to reduce their costs. They hope that in the future that contribution of government to the industry will be improved very substantially, but they are not sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of this debate seems to have got a little out of hand, because so many of the cost advantages that the Opposition proposes for the car industry have not been fully taken into account. I believe that by substantially reducing the cost of manufacturing cars in Australia and by going through the process of micro-economic reform in the vital way it has to be done in this country, we will be able to achieve the objective of turning our car industry from being the relatively struggling industry it is today into an extremely profitable and dynamic industry for the future. This industry will be export oriented, and will be able to afford to be export oriented by being internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed this afternoon that on a radio program in Adelaide Mr Ray Grigg, general manager, operations, for Holden's Motor Co., made some interesting comments about the car industry. It is worth reflecting on these comments. In answer to a question on the issue of reducing tariffs, Mr Grigg said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . from all our numbers that we've put together, that we can see that we can survive, as long as there's a realistic pace of duty reductions from the present levels, provided we have support of a really efficient national economy.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fair enough comment. Who could dispute that?  That is a commonsense, ordinary, logical comment for him to make. The fact is we do not have an efficient national economy by any measure in the OECD and indeed by comparison with other rapidly industrialising countries. It is about time people faced up to that obvious reality. Mr Grigg went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I think the key really is to ensure our viability is the linkage between the rate of tariff reduction and microeconomic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly that has to be achieved. I congratulate Holden's on making the fundamental point that this country must achieve the micro-economic reform that has been promised for so long and has never been delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Automotive Industry Authority's annual report, which was published last week, said that if we do not start doing something about reforming our micro economy&mdash;and one could add bringing our taxation system into the 1990s and out of the 1930s&mdash;then our car industry simply will not survive. It does not matter what level of tariffs we have, we must ensure that the car industry becomes more competitive through changes to the tax system and micro-economic reform. Mr Grigg and other people in the car industry have made that point very clearly. I think that will be a very important challenge for this Parliament in the years ahead. To reiterate the point I made: the car industry will not survive if micro-economic reform and tax reform is not achieved over the next eight or nine years. If it is achieved then we can turn that car industry into one of the most dynamic car industries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two or three minutes I want to make a couple of points about the defence budget. First of all, I draw the attention of the House to a statement made by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, in the Senate on 11 December last year. When making a very political point designed to attack the coalition, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Ministers who become Minister for Defence have an obligation to the future of the defence forces&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I would not argue with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to see a secure and proper future for the defence forces and not some cheap opportunist political trick to rip money off defence to no effect.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are at our absolute minimum in respect of defence expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is what the Minister said on 11 December last year, how does he explain that in the defence budget it is proposed that defence spending be cut by $50m a year each year from 1993-94 onwards?  We have a range of other objections to the way in which the defence budget has been handled. There is once more a cut to the combat capability of the Australian Defence Force. There has been no effort at all to reduce the bureaucratic and non-combat costs, when I would have thought it made perfect commonsense to bring us at the very minimum into line with comparable defence forces around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also very concerned that the defence budget is being used, to some extent, to finance so-called make work schemes instead of being used to ensure that we improve the effectiveness of the combat capability of our Defence Force. We are very disappointed to see that Labor is continuing with its Ready Reserve program, which is proving to be a massive cost blow-out. The cost of the Ready Reserve at the moment is running at 71 per cent of the cost of regulars, which is a massive blow-out from the original figure of around 40 per cent. Not only will the Ready Reserve fail to improve the combat capability of the Defence Force by definition in that it replaces regulars, but it will also reduce the combat effectiveness and the Government will save very little money in the process. That does not make much sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a range of other things I would like to say about the defence budget but time does not permit me. I conclude by saying that the Government spends something like $75m on defence cooperation with our regional neighbours, which is only slightly more than it spends on the telephone bill for the Department of Defence. That says something about the Labor Party's priority for the defence of this country and the need for our country to work more closely with our regional neighbours in order to underwrite the security of our part of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will understand that shortly. We have seen in recent years this debate about economies moving towards non-human terms&mdash;it is dehumanised and mechanistic. The parameters and details all ignore people. I find it fascinating that we hear `people' being used in some pejorative sense. Rather than the economy being to help people, it is being put forward by so many of the commentators, and certainly some of the economists, as people being the victims of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, the Budget should be a human document, and this one is. It is about jobs, activity and where things are happening. In the same way as an economy should be talked of in human terms, so should the question of change in a society. In our modern electronic age it is very easy to talk about change. We can modify a computer program in a matter of seconds and it will apply instantly right across the country and across the world. It is very simple to do that. We can drive along in our cars, get to a corner and turn left or right, very simply, and we are going in an entirely different direction. It is so easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the kinds of changes that people keep talking about. That is the kind of methodology that we keep hearing for the mechanistics in this community. But the fact is that real change is about people&mdash;about people changing, people adapting. In a sense, that cannot be hustled, it cannot be hurried and it cannot be accelerated by pushing a foot down, turning a wheel or pushing a button because it is about people absorbing and adapting and modifying their behaviour, understanding and knowledge base. Those who think they understand how fast a community can change are deluding themselves and others. What we are seeing in the world, but particularly in Australia, is a massive degree of change taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some who argue that we could change much faster and that the way to make change happen faster is to accelerate the forces of change&mdash;put more pressure on people. Sure, people would change faster, but it would not be change; it would be collapse. That kind of change is not progress; that kind of change is chaos&mdash;and that is what we hear about so much from the other side. At the same time we hear so much talking down of Australia. We are being insulted daily as being incompetent. We are being told how hopeless we are and how we have done so badly. Mind you, most of it was done when those opposite were in government. We hear from those opposite criticisms of people who rent and all the other pejorative things; they blame society for what they see as measurements in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Australian community is changing, and in many ways much more rapidly than most of the world. This Budget does reflect that. I draw attention to page 2.37 which looks at the composition of exports. We see the change that has occurred in the last 10 years in both elaborate and simple manufactured exports from Australia. That massive change is occurring in our community, in our society, and is reflected in the Budget and in the economy. The fact that we are now exporting more manufactured goods&mdash;things that we make or grow&mdash;is a substantial change. There was a manufactures surplus of $3.9 billion in the last financial year. That would have been unheard of 10 years ago. The growth in services is also encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That also brings us to the question of where the economy truly is and where it can best go. The event since the Budget which has been exciting and very positive has been the modification of the exchange rate of the Australian dollar. In theory a nation's currency reflects its cost of production. In Australia its currency has not reflected that; it has reflected its resource base and its stability. In other words, we have been marked up by the world as being a stable society and in turn our currency has been given a higher value. The adjustments that have occurred in recent weeks are very positive and will be very productive. For those manufactured exports that we have seen in the last two to three years the change in currency essentially improves the profitability of those companies that have been exporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a revolution going on inside Australian factories. But one only knows about it if one goes in them. Hence to many of the economists and commentators&mdash;certainly most of those honourable members opposite, if not all of them&mdash;what is happening is invisible; they do not see it. They do not go inside the factories to find out what is taking place. From the outside they look the same; there are the same buildings with the same names on the doors. But inside there has been dramatic change which is why so many of them are now exporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall back in 1983 going around the major companies in my area, such as BHP, Tubemakers, Goninan, Commonwealth Steel and a whole host of major Australian companies. Quite frankly, most of them were not exporting and back in those years had no hope of exporting. Now virtually all of them are exporting. A fundamental part of their business plans is now exports. Last year BHP Newcastle exported 40 per cent of its steel products. As we all know, that was not at a highly profitable rate. But if it were to export the same volume at the same overseas price in the current year, it would make 10 per cent more in profits. That is why the exchange rate is so important. What we are seeing is a potential for a massive uplift in company profits for those companies exporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that addresses one of the concerns that most of us would have had in terms of recovery. As we come out of recession, there is a real danger that those companies that have been exporting and doing it so well will tend to cater more for the domestic market and drop off export activities because of the lack of profitability. Of course, the change in the dollar value means that that will not happen; they will maintain their exports because it is worth while doing so as they are now so profitable. That is why this current thrust of economic policy has to be sustained where it is. That is why we must maintain our support for the workplace changes that have taken place and which have allowed these companies to become so productive, and maintain the economic and financial support for those companies, particularly the ones relating to depreciation mentioned in One Nation and also referred to in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties that companies have found in lifting our trade, particularly into Asia because we all understand the difficulties of culture, language, habits and attitudes&mdash;are not easy ones to overcome. As a country that has predominantly exported to the English speaking world for most of its life, to adapt as well as we have done to export to Asia has been a tremendous performance. I really get annoyed when I see our companies being bucketed indirectly, and even directly at times, by those opposite. They really do put down our people. We have damned good management in our companies these days and our work force is as productive as any in the world. One has only to go to factories in Sweden, Germany or England, as I have, to see the difference and to recognise that we are as capable as any in terms of production, and we are doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, an Australian company has been to Canada to look at alternative production technologies and methodologies. What it found was that in general the Australian companies are as good as those in Canada. But the end result of that process has been a change in this company that will make it the best in the world, way ahead of almost any other. That has been agreed to and is under way. Certainly, that company's performance in the last six months has been spectacular. That sort of thing has been happening all over the place. There have been no massive headlines; there has been no big story and no hysteria about it. People have been going about their business properly and appropriately. What is more, they are getting results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So to my mind the decline in the value of the dollar has been not a blessing but a constructive rebalancing of our economy. One must take into account the Budget projections in what I see now as a different light in terms of the dollar value. I therefore expect that our companies will maintain their directions and their emphasis on exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that that change has been designed in human terms and has to be measured in human terms; otherwise it will introduce chaos. The boundary between orderly change and chaos is a very fine one. One often does not know where that boundary is until it has been exceeded, although in many cases one can see the potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has been putting forward in this debate&mdash;and in virtually every debate, as I mentioned earlier&mdash;a rationale to support its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. I do not blame those opposite in a way because it is pretty hard to support the policy and they need all the air time they can get. The reasons for that are that the document itself has some deep and fundamental problems. Certainly, it would become a major impediment for the kind of growth that I was speaking of and the maintenance of the export drive that has been going for the last three or four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem with Fightback is the uncertainty. The document is absolutely vague. We keep hearing about it being definitive and detailed, but in so many areas it is not just vague but obscure and misleading. The honourable member for Mayo just spoke about savings and excise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand it better than most. What I am talking about is lack of clarity. That is what the building industry is on about right now. Why is it so concerned if the document is so clear and so wonderful? Why is it asking for dramatic changes to Fightback?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care is another area in which there is a lack of clarity. There is puzzlement as to whether wheelchairs should be or will be taxed. There is puzzlement about the medications a pensioner gets on a script which can also be bought over a counter. If they are on a script, it is `health'; if they are purchased over the counter, they may just taste nice and have no health impact whatsoever. Can people choose their own exemptions by taking vitamin E or vitamin B1 because they want to and not because they are required to by a doctor for their health? Which one is exempt? Both? Neither? That is the kind of lack of clarity I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmacists understand all this very well. They know exactly how it is all going to work, as do other businesses. What happens when we tell shopkeepers that they will have to get a new cash register on which to do their calculations because the old one probably will not be any good? There is no compensation. They will have to buy it. We will see a cash register-led recovery. There will be a massive growth in imports. We do not make them; we import them all. We will see literally millions of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one simple sum that needs to be understood. At the moment we have 75,000 collectors collecting $9 billion. Under Fightback we will have one million to 1 1/2 million collectors collecting $27 billion. In other words, we will have three times the revenue for 10 to 15 times as many collectors. This is supposed to be an efficient tax. Perhaps it is efficient for the government, but it certainly will not be efficient for business, because most of those people cannot claim a thing. They do not pay payroll tax. They are not involved in wholesale sales tax now. They are not involved in the training levy. They are not involved in any of those savings we hear about. For them it is all on-costs. It is all a new charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see an army of collectors, ranging from the mums in the tuckshops to the football clubs, from the barber to the taxi driver, and&mdash;an important one&mdash;the hairdresser. Let us not forget the child-care centres. All over Australia, millions of them will be conscripted into an army of collectors. Their lives will be dominated by suddenly having a position of collecting public money, which means that they must be accountable; they can be scrutinised by the Audit Office. We know what that means. If they are behind or make a mistake, it is their problem. If they give credit and go broke, tough luck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we then need to go to the next logical stage: the stage the Italians have reached? We hear about the black economy that this is going to be so good for. It is so good for the black economy that the Italians have brought in laws requiring customers to have a docket within 100 yards of where they bought their goods. We see children in Italy being convicted of the crime of not having a receipt. Will we reach that stage as well? Fightback does not say. It lacks clarity. There is massive confusion as to what all that actually means. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is the impact on normal people; those people for whom we see so little thought from the Opposition. We feel sympathy for the unemployed. The Budget reflects the great concern for the unemployed being canvassed in political circles in Australia. Their level of expenditure is so limited&mdash;they spend virtually all they get; and in many cases more, by borrowing&mdash;that all of it would be impacted by a GST. The idea that somehow they can make up for it on savings on wholesale sales tax!</PARA>

We just heard there would be a different price. We would go back to the old system of differential pricing. From all the experience of the last eight years, the Opposition has learnt nothing.

Whilst the recession is now ending, the recovery is coming through and exports have been going up, that will all come to an end while people wait to see what is going happen. What the Opposition is putting forward is a stagnation. It is much more than a double dip.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a very good example of the Government's misinformation campaign about the coalition's Fightback package; a very good example of the way this Government and its members are prepared to distort the proposals being put forward in a very positive and constructive manner by the coalition to try to rebuild Australia's rather shattered economy. It also shows us an abysmal lack of understanding not just of the coalition's tax changes but of the existing tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that he sit down and read what the Fightback package is all about and what the tax changes are all about rather than reading his dot, dot, dot press releases from the Labor Party headquarters that just enable him to put his name into the appropriate place without having to do any thinking about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standard of the speech we just heard reflects the standard of the Budget which was delivered in this House a couple of short weeks ago. The fact that the Budget sank without trace within 48 hours of its launch by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is indicative of the fact that the business community, and the broader community at large, saw this Budget as nothing more than an effort by a rather desperate government to try to buy votes by creating thousands of short term artificial jobs with hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget provides no real prospect of long term jobs as a result of any of the initiatives in the Budget. The Budget spends much of the taxpayers' money in creating short term jobs. Interestingly enough, the creation of those jobs will all fall within the next couple of months. They must all be in place by January next year. That is sufficiently well timed to ensure that unemployment figures come down as a result of the artificial jobs being put in place prior to the March election next year. It is nothing more than a rather cynical exercise to try to reduce the unemployment figures, even though it will be for a short period. It is sufficient to bring the unemployment figures down prior to the next election, which will give the Government some desperate hope of re-election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget really does not do much at all other than to create the biggest deficit that Australia has ever seen&mdash;some $13.4 billion. The real deficit in this Budget is more than $13.4 billion; it runs at around $20.9 billion. We should take into account the fact that this Government is selling several billions of dollars of government assets and is treating those asset sales as if they were normal revenue. By doing that we would find the true Budget deficit, the operating deficit of this Government for the next financial year, is $20.9 billion. There has been some very clever artificial constructive&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, pushing one pay period through, which saves around $700m, as the Leader of the National Party points out. The Government is also taking the sale of Australian Airlines&mdash;which I think occurred today&mdash;as normal revenue. The sale of Australian Airlines is achieved by selling it to the Government's other airline, which happens to be Qantas Airways Ltd. Qantas is borrowing $400m to pay for Australian Airlines. Yet the Government is treating the sale of one of its airlines to another one of its airlines, which is using borrowed money to finance the whole deal, as normal operating revenue for the current financial year. That example highlights the creative accounting that this Government has engaged in and, coupled with the other example that the Leader of the National Party has pointed out to me by way of interjection, it shows the very cynical ends that this Government will go to in order to paint a different picture from the reality that exists today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government engages in many attempts to distract Australians' attention from the reality of the day: we have seen the Government engage in an attack on the monarchy in an attempt to introduce a republic and we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) denigrate the Australian flag, both in Australia and overseas&mdash;one of the most disgraceful acts of any Prime Minister in the course of his tenure of office as Prime Minister. In the last few days we have seen the Prime Minister try to distract the nation's attention further by suggesting that the Senate ought to be abolished&mdash;yet another attempt by this Prime Minister to take us away from the real issues that concern the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue that concerns the average Australian, which the Government had hoped would be addressed in this Budget, is the nearly one million people who are unemployed as a result of the recession that we `had to have', the recession that was engineered by none other than the man who stands in this House as the Prime Minister of Australia. He engineered this recession, he told us we had to have it and the responsibility of this recession rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of our Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal issue Australia faces at present is how to create lasting jobs for the one million unemployed and how to deal with our growing foreign debt with a net value today of around $150 billion. When this Labor Government came into power in 1983, net foreign debt was around $22 billion. In 9 1/2 years it has blown out from $22 billion to $150 billion. It is a disgraceful legacy that this Government will leave to future generations of Australians. They will not only have to pay the interest on that foreign debt; they will have to try to reduce the capital over the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government is responsible for record bankruptcies and has caused hardship to nearly one million Australians and their families. This Budget does nothing to address the root causes of Australia's problems. What does it do for farmers? There is absolutely nothing in the Budget which farmers can point to and say, `This is good for me. This will enable me to expand my operations, which will enable me to pay back some of my debts and try to create a few jobs in my community'.

By borrowing $18 billion and by undertaking the sorts of policies that it does, small businessmen, farmers and businessmen generally can expect to see interest rates increasing. Indeed, we have already had two banks increase interest rates over the last couple of weeks since the Budget came out. That is an indication of things to come.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And hidden taxes, as the honourable member for Murray points out. Within 24 hours the Opposition was able to highlight to the people of Australia&mdash;it has been picked up by economic commentators around the country&mdash;that this Budget is full of not only increased costs through the superannuation guarantee levy but also hidden taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also remember that, in the next few months, there will be an increased cost to businesses again as this Government does a deal with its old pal and running mate, the ACTU. Honourable members should wait and see. Wages will increase within the next few months as this Government does a deal with the ACTU to trade off its continuing support for the Labor Party to get the sort of assistance&mdash;material and otherwise&mdash;that it needs for the next election campaign. Costs are increasing for farmers and for businesses and job prospects are decreasing. That is the net result of the Budget that was delivered by the Treasurer a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we debate this Budget tonight it is important that we recognise the incredible hardship that exists in the community. There are extraordinary things going on in my own electorate. I have been talking to farmers and small businessmen over the last few months. I have asked them how their businesses are going and whether they are able to keep their head above water. Nearly everyone&mdash;whether they be farmers or small businessmen&mdash;has said, `We're hanging in there by the skin of our teeth. We don't know how much longer we are going to survive'. I was at the Harden Show last weekend and I spoke to some of the farmers there. They said, `Maybe we'll survive until Christmas. With luck, if wheat prices do not collapse, we might survive another year'. That example, coupled with the numerous examples there are in talking to small businessmen, indicates how tenuous it is for many small businessmen and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People say to me, `Farmers had a few great years in the latter 1980s. Wool prices were up and wheat prices were good. Surely farmers were able to overcome their economic problems during those years so that they could weather a prolonged recession such as the one the ex-Treasurer and now Prime Minister has given us'. Had we not suffered the impost of high interest rates during the latter 1980s that would have been the case. High interest rates meant that rather than farmers and small businessmen reducing their debts, their debts were either staying the same or even increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of the man who now stands here as Prime Minister was to increase interest rates to the point where they nearly strangled the Australian economy. The direct consequence of that is that many of our farmers and small businessmen today are in very bad shape as a result of the recession. We are now seeing record bankruptcies and farmers are walking off their farms. In many cases, farmers are trapped on the farm&mdash;they are unable to make the place pay, are unable to sell it and are unable to walk off it&mdash;with nowhere to go because of the circumstances</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, I will get on to that. If the honourable member wants to talk about road user charges, there are a lot of things that we can talk about in terms of road funding. We can talk about the reductions in transport costs that will be generated as a result of the Fightback package&mdash;reductions in transport costs that go beyond anything that this Government has ever done. All that this Government has done since it got into office is put up the cost of transport, put up the cost of operating a truck and reduce the amount of funding that has been put into the roads budget by about 30 per cent in real terms. That is the legacy that this Government has left to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hope that we will give transport operators, small businessmen and farmers is highlighted in the NFF's analysis of the Fightback package in which it undertook a review of the effect of Fightback on the operating expenses and income of a farm. It is interesting to note that in that analysis the NFF highlights the fact that as a result of the implementation of the Fightback package farm incomes will increase by about 22 per cent in, say, a beef property in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my territory, in southern New South Wales, the NFF did an analysis of how the Fightback package would affect a wheat and sheep farm. The NFF says that a wheat and sheep property's net income would increase by 15 per cent. In anybody's terms, 15 per cent is a significant increase for a farmer in my electorate. That is the net consequence of the implementation of the coalition's Fightback package. I believe that it is that type of initiative that we need to see coming from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to see the abolition of payroll tax, the abolition of fuel excise and the abolition of wholesale sales taxes. It involves reform of our Australian taxation system to put incentive back into the system and to give people the opportunity to save money. It will give them the chance to have more money left in their pay packet at the end of the fortnight. That is the sort of thing that the NFF in its analysis of our Fightback package recognises is the net result of the coalition's activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity also to point out a particular concern about the city of Goulburn. In the next couple of months the city of Goulburn will see the opening of the bypass. In many ways this will be a welcome event as the 3,500 trucks which have travelled down the main street of Goulburn every 24 hours for the past few years have caused a great deal of difficulty for the city, a city which seeks to make itself an attractive place. Also the heavy traffic has put at risk the lives of many people in the city, who fear that one of those thousands of trucks might tip over and cause all sorts of injury and damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bypass is a good thing. Unfortunately, with the bypass will come a reduction in income for the city of Goulburn. We all expected that to be the case, but the unfortunate aspect of the reduction in income resulting from the bypass is that it will be coupled with the worst recession we have had for 60 years. As a result of that many small businessmen in Goulburn are telling me that the reduction in income that they will experience as a result of the bypass will be the last straw for them. In good or reasonably good years they could have weathered the reduction in income as a result of the bypass. But the bypass coupled with a recession will cause a major problem for employers in Goulburn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things we saw in the Budget a couple of weeks ago was this Government going about the business of handing out large amounts of money to local governments. But it did not do it to every local government; it did it on a rather ad hoc basis. We noted that millions of dollars went to the electorate of the Prime Minister. Indeed, not a single cent came to the city of Goulburn, which has some 2,300 people unemployed. That is really unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another part of my electorate, in Nowra, the city of Shoalhaven, with 3,697 unemployed, received a sum of $2m. Yet Goulburn&mdash;a smaller place than the city of Shoalhaven&mdash;with 2,301 people unemployed did not get a single cent. Why is it that unemployed people in Goulburn do not rate one single dollar of extra assistance, yet unemployed people in Nowra rate $2m worth of extra assistance? I think that this is grossly inequitable. I think that the people of Goulburn and other towns in my electorate who got absolutely nothing have a right to ask why it is better to be unemployed in one town rather than the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the House tonight that in light of the fact that we have a recession&mdash;one engineered by the Prime Minister, who is personally pleased with the fact&mdash;and the fact that the city of Goulburn has a bypass that will be opened in the next couple of months and that it will have a deleterious effect on the income of that city, I think Goulburn has a right to claim a portion of that local government money that has been distributed around Australia. If Nowra is entitled to $2m and in view of the number of people unemployed in Goulburn, then on the basis of equity Goulburn is entitled to $1.25m of local government assistance to try to help overcome the effects of the recession, particularly in light of the opening of the bypass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House tonight that that type of initiative should be undertaken to offset the effect of the recession, to offset the effect of the bypass, and to ensure that equity becomes part of the system of allocating funds to local government bodies to try to assist unemployed people in our community. The unemployed in Goulburn have just as much right to assistance as do the unemployed in Nowra. If the Government is interested in equity it should heed my suggestion and put $1.25m worth of funds into local government in Goulburn to try to assist the unemployed and to put some capital into the community to help overcome the effect of the bypass and the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those words tonight, I think one can conclude that the Budget delivered by the Treasurer has been even less well received than the Budget delivered by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) just 12 months ago. The Budget delivered by the honourable member for Werriwa just 12 months ago was one of the worst delivered by any government in Australia. I think that the Budget delivered by the current Treasurer beats even that sad track record. We will not see productivity in Australia improving. We will not see our competitiveness improve as a result of this Budget. We will not see any long-term job prospects created as a result of this Budget.

Since the election of this Government in 1983, more than 1.8 million new jobs have been created. Government policies with respect to labour market programs and services have been instrumental in achieving this magnificent outcome, and the progress goes on. This financial year, for example, the Federal Government has budgeted to spend $1,185m to provide 428,000 places through a number of labour market programs to assist disadvantaged job seekers. These programs include wage subsidies, vocationally oriented training courses, Skillshare, land care and environment action programs and many other assistance packages which will bring about new opportunities for the job seeker. </PARA>

So too would the Aitkenvale office of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Ingham office of the Commonwealth Employment Service would cease to exist. Job applicants would be compelled to seek out private employment contractors and such like in their scramble to find work. The wage subsidies program would be abolished and expenditure on vocationally oriented training courses would be cut by $58m. The cuts on these two programs, on the basis of 1992-93 Budget figures, would represent a drop of $340m or 135,000 places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more menacing for the unemployed, the Jobsearch allowance and the Newstart allowance would be abolished for those who have been unemployed for nine months. The unemployed would be provided with a training voucher. That is what Fightback would mean to them. After the completion of their training course, there would be no offer of a program place, unlike the Government's accredited training offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the attitude of some private employment agencies to the disadvantaged in the labour market. No-one seriously believes that all job seekers would be treated equally. Do honourable members believe that women, the disabled, Aborigines and the long term unemployed would have equal access to the job market? The answer is no. The Commonwealth Employment Service currently places over four times as many people in jobs as private agencies. The advantages of a Commonwealth agency such as the Commonwealth Employment Service would be gone. Fightback would victimise the unemployed. Fightback would compel many to pay fees to private employment agencies&mdash;together with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. It would create a new and permanent underclass of embittered Australians, and all the while the unemployed would continue to pay Fightback's 15 per cent tax on food, rent, clothing, transport and almost everything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that this crazy decision in Fightback to abolish the Commonwealth Employment Service is part of the coalition's decision to cut $10 billion from Federal Government spending. Also, why does Fightback propose to end the Jobsearch allowance after nine months? This is a truly heartless and malevolent proposal. The Opposition proposes that persons who have been receiving the Jobsearch allowance for nine months will be required to apply for the more restrictive special benefit. It is apparently lost on the Opposition that Australia has done remarkably well in minimising long term employment without requiring benefits to be terminated. This is another example of Fightback policy craziness and if it were ever implemented it would, in my view, cause a spectacular rise in crime. Australian cities would no longer be as safe as they are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of higher education. Since 1983 student numbers at Australian universities and the former colleges of advanced education have increased from 348,600 to about 560,000. A tiny fraction of this number are overseas students. Importantly, this Labor Government has increased funding by $1.25 billion and additional funding of $314m is planned over the next two years. In my electorate, James Cook University has been a major recipient of increased recurrent funding as well as being the beneficiary of a huge capital works program. New buildings at James Cook University are sprouting up all over the campus. Whereas there were about 3,000 students in 1983, there are now about 8,000, and by 1996 it is planned that there will be 11,000 students. When this number of students is reached, the participation rate will approximate that of the national average. So for years James Cook University was starved by conservative governments of essential funding for capital works and student places. The result was that thousands of North Queenslanders were denied the career opportunities provided by a university education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would expect that, with such a disgraceful record, the Liberal and National parties would make amends and design a policy to take full advantage of the innate abilities and ambitions of qualified Australians wishing to achieve a university education. But Fightback contains no hope for them. The policies of Fightback provide for a voucher system of funding. According to the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the Opposition's policy is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to allow all universities to determine fees for all courses and all students.</PARA>
<PARA>He has described this as a key element of the Opposition's policy. So the financially disadvantaged would be denied equity in access to higher education. It is false for the Opposition to claim that up-front fees would open up more places at universities. Fees for a three-year arts degree are about $25,000, and for a six-year medicine degree the cost is $130,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it will provide scholarships and affordable loans, but does anyone seriously believe the promises of scholarships when the Leader of the Opposition has pledged to cut $10 billion from the Federal Budget? Furthermore, loans would be made available on a commercial basis&mdash;that is to say, at commercial interest rates. The question must be asked: would there be a loss of students in relatively expensive courses such as engineering, science and agriculture? This is at a time when there is a crying need for more engineers and scientists in Australia. More ominously, the voucher system proposed by the Opposition would effectively remove control over admissions policies from universities. This situation would be untenable. It is obvious that the Fightback program of the Liberal and National parties does not recognise the element of public good in higher education. The fundamental outcome of Fightback would be to restrict the benefits that higher education brings to the Australian economy, to Australian society and to Australian culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another misleading claim by the Opposition is that it would exempt or zero rate educational institutions from its goods and services tax of 15 per cent. The exemption does not apply to the provision of food or beverages to students, nor does it extend to the activities of university companies. James Cook University has formed such companies, and they have an important role in commercialising the results of research conducted at that university. These companies would bear the full brunt of the coalition's consumption tax of 15 per cent, and I have no doubt that as a consequence their activities would be severely curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Cook University is also active in the export of educational services. There is now a risk that these could also be targeted and slugged with a consumption tax of 15 per cent. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 1 September 1992 reported that a technical committee working out the details of the Opposition's consumption tax is considering recommending that the goods and services tax on educational export services should apply. This means, in effect, a 15 per cent tax on overseas students revenue raised by universities. On the basis of 1990 revenues from overseas students, this would cost Australian universities around $21m a year. Ominously, the Opposition has so far failed to reject this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Opposition's onslaught against higher education does not finish at this point. Fightback promises a review of Austudy, with intended cuts of $114m and a 6 per cent increase to compensate for the goods and services tax. Families in North Queensland with children intending to proceed to university would be aghast to learn that the Liberal shadow Minister has described the proposal to replace Austudy grants with loans as `unambiguously progressive'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Cook University, which has a particular responsibility for the education of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, could be forced to abandon its programs for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders because the coalition has a firm proposal to save $13m by abandoning eligibility for income support under Abstudy. I have no doubt that, were that policy to be introduced, participation by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in higher education would sharply diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the policies of the Liberal and National parties on higher education would destroy equity of access, reduce institutional autonomy, and place impossible financial burdens on students. In the final analysis, the higher education policies of the Opposition would diminish both the higher education system itself and the system's contribution to the broad Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of transport. Recently the Government announced the largest ever Federal government annual road funding program. In 1992-93 a total of $2.3 billion in Federal funds will be spent on roads. This is an outstanding achievement. Federal Government road funding this year will not only dramatically improve Australia's land transport infrastructure but also provide employment for up to 50,000 people. If Australia is to improve its international competitiveness, it is fundamental that it possess an efficient road transport system. The allocation of $2.3 billion of Federal road funds this year is proof of this Labor Government's determination not only to maintain but also to rehabilitate the national highway system across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Federal Government's road allocation to Queensland is $373.7m, which is a 37 per cent increase on last year's amount. In addition, local governments in Queensland will receive $68m from the Federal Government for road works. This is a proud achievement of the Federal Labor Government. It is an achievement which is unmatched by any government in Australia's history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these guaranteed commitments to road funding could be either abandoned or placed in grave jeopardy if the coalition were to win the next Federal election. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document pledges a future Liberal-National Federal government to reduce road funding to 1991-92 levels, with funding to be reviewed at some later date. This is $900m less than the Labor Government's existing program. Every Australian motorist and road user should write to the Leader of the Opposition and ask him how he is going to meet the $3.9 billion shortfall in revenue under his Fightback manifesto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should also ask the Leader of the Opposition how he would implement his policy to impose road user charges. They should also ask him to guarantee that the States will not be forced to hike up car registration charges and fuel franchise fees because of his policies. Under the user pays pricing principles favoured by the Leader of the Opposition, the cost of registering a four-cylinder Holden Commodore in Queensland at September 1992 prices, including third party insurance, would jump from $397.70 to more than $1,000. This alone would provoke outrage from motorists in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Leader of the Opposition guarantee in writing that there will be sufficient funds to meet the necessary additional construction and maintenance costs of roads for which the Federal Government is responsible without increasing his 15 per cent goods and services tax? I do not expect the Leader of the Opposition to be in a hurry to answer these questions, because the fact is that the Fightback manifesto of the Liberal and National parties would result in the biggest slug on motorists ever perpetrated by any Liberal-National government, or indeed by any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australian road users, and particularly road users in North Queensland, the Opposition's policy would doom many North Queensland transport operators and inflict prohibitive freight costs on the delivery of goods to North Queensland. The people of North Queensland reject out of hand a road policy which is based on a road user charge&mdash;a move which would cancel out the removal of the fuel tax. Because of Fightback, the people of northern Australia in particular are confronted with a threat to their standard of living. People should be made aware of that. The price of Fightback is too high for Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity, in the first debate on the Appropriation Bills since I was appointed shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment, to give some indication to the House of, firstly, my personal approach to this portfolio and, secondly, the Opposition's approach to the subject of sustainable development and the environment. I say without qualification that I am delighted to be in this portfolio. It enables me to pursue lifelong issues in which I have had a deep interest long before they were recognised under the descriptive word `environment'. Ever since childhood I have enjoyed the Australian bush. I have enjoyed bushwalking. As I got older I developed aesthetic sensibilities, with a taste in music, theatre, opera, architecture and landscape, and continued these interests over the whole of the period to the present day. So it is a delight to be able to carry out professionally some of the things that hitherto I have enjoyed privately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I would like to make quite clear to the House and to anybody who has an interest in this portfolio is that if people come to me on these issues they will certainly be dealing with somebody who feels passionately about them and has thought about them deeply over a very long period, and certainly for many years before they became a matter of high political interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has not always been the case in Australia. We did not have in earlier days an enormously good record, for example, of preserving our built heritage. It is a very great sadness to me that in my home city of Sydney a number of buildings were demolished in the earlier part of this century, and until comparatively recent times, that certainly should not have been demolished. It is a very sad thing to have happened to those wonderful colonial buildings. Fortunately, over more recent years&mdash;and over the last 20 years, in particular&mdash;there have been quite substantial changes in people's attitudes to these things, and there is public support for preserving what is good, and, certainly, for trying to improve environmental standards across a broad range of human activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to look a little at the history of this issue, because it is commonly assumed that the political attention to it has been very recent. I can remember 20 years ago, when I took over from Sir John Carrick&mdash;then Mr Carrick&mdash;as the General Secretary of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, the appointment by the then Liberal Government of the first Federal department to include the term `environment'. The Hon. Peter Howson was the Minister in that area. I recall visiting the well-known conservationist Vincent Serventy to seek his advice on improvements to the environmental policies of the McMahon Government in the lead up to the 1972 election. Indeed, Mr Serventy wrote to me on my recent appointment, reminding me of that particular meeting. A lot of the advice that he gave me is certainly still very sound, and I intend to follow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly draw to the attention of the House some of the achievements of the coalition in the area of the environment. I mentioned already that we set up the first Federal department to include the environment in 1971. We were responsible for the development of the national conservation strategy for Australia, and we made the first grants to significant voluntary conservation organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Antarctica, we were responsible for the Antarctic Treaty Act of 1960, and, much later in the period of the Fraser Government, the introduction of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act of 1980, and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act of 1981. We were pioneers in the preservation of whales. We commissioned the Frost report, and introduced the Whale Protection Act of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 we introduced the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Imports and Exports) Act and the Migratory Birds Ordinance of 1980. We attempted, with some success, to arrive at satisfactory arrangements with the States on these matters, with the offshore constitutional settlement of 1980 and, earlier than that, in fact, with the Environment (Financial Assistance) Act of 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to national parks, we were responsible for proclaiming the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We also prevented sandmining on Fraser Island. We proclaimed the Kakadu and Uluru parks. We proclaimed the Christmas Island National Park. We established marine nature reserves through the Coral Sea proclamations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also active in the control of pollution. We introduced unleaded petrol to Australia. We also introduced the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act of 1981 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act of 1983. We actually proposed that for introduction, but it was subsequently passed by the Hawke Government. Earlier than that, we passed the States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Act of 1976, the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act of 1978, and the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act of 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of water management, we gave the Murray River Commission power over water quality management control in 1982, and we were responsible for initiating the bicentennial waters program. In the area of World Heritage, we secured the listings of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu Stage I, and the Willandra Lakes in 1981. We initiated proposals for the listing of the Lord Howe Islands Group in 1982, and the western Tasmanian wilderness in 1982. We did all this with the consent and cooperation of the respective State or Territory governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On other matters, we commissioned major Federal environmental impact statements. In particular, I mention Fraser Island and the Alligator Rivers system. We established the Office of the Supervising Scientist to ensure the safety of the mining of uranium. We set up the national soil conservation program in 1980, and the national tree program of 1982. We set up the National Estate Register, and made the first listings in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a substantial listing of environmental actions by coalition governments. So anybody who comes along in more recent days and says that there has not been a very big commitment by the coalition to environmental issues simply does not understand the history; they merely look at the rewriting of history by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to more recent history, and look at the 1990 election. Leading up to the 1990 election, we had a spring cleaning of coalition policies on the environment, which was led by my then colleague Senator Chris Puplick. This required looking back on our achievements in the environmental area, which were substantial. We were looking in a progressive way at what we should be doing for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of that review, Senator Puplick consulted with all groups in the community which had an interest in the environment, whether they be environmental bodies, miners, foresters, or anybody who was likely to have an impact on the environment. He initiated a long-ranging debate within the coalition as to what our policies should be, and we all agreed on a progressive, but realistic, set of policies. All the environmental groups, in particular, were consulted, and they all knew the criteria on which we based those policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of politics, Senator Richardson was the Minister responsible in this area. He put to the conservation movement a set of policies which, quite honestly, could never realistically be delivered. We suffered enormous political damage in that campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Foundation, led by Mr Philip Toyne, actually endorsed for the very first time a political party&mdash;the Labor Party&mdash;on the basis of the proposals put to it by Senator Richardson. We had to stand firm on our policies, because we did not believe, for example, that it was realistic to propose some kind of Whitlamesque overriding of the States in this area, since the States had substantial constitutional powers in the area of the environment. We were quite honest with all the groups that we spoke to. We said the same thing to everybody, regardless of from which direction they came. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the election, we were chopped off at the knees by leading members of conservation groups. Of course, the preferences of people supporting those policies went mainly to the Labor Party and, since it was a preference election, they probably had something to do with the outcome of the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened after the election? As we pointed out to these various groups, they were, indeed, disappointed. In many respects, the Labor Party&mdash;the Labor Government&mdash;backed down on those commitments. One important backdown was the establishment of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment between the Commonwealth and the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had made it quite clear in the election campaign that it was not possible to have sensible environmental management without a cooperative attitude on the part of the Commonwealth towards the States. The States have the capacity in their constitutional powers to influence almost every major environmental decision. It was just not real life to suggest that the Commonwealth, by using external affairs powers or whatever, could override these State responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There had to be cooperation, and the Labor Government realised that. It set up the inter-governmental agreement, which may or may not be perfect, but it was certainly an endorsement of the position that we had taken quite honestly before the election. Of course, it was a great disappointment to certain elements of the environment movement who had believed Senator Richardson. Senator Richardson's successor, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly), has been put in a very awkward position. She has had to try to meet the needs of the constituency that had been created to try to fulfil unreal expectations and, of course, has necessarily disappointed the people who had those expectations. Therefore, there is not a very high degree of confidence amongst the environmental movement in the Labor Party or in the present Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem that has occurred is that issues relating to the environment are a matter of great contention and public difference between two Ministers in the Cabinet&mdash;the Minister for the environment and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). It seems that the way in which the Government operates is to have two Ministers, each with separate clientele, who have arguments in a semi-public fashion. That is very destructive way of dealing with environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our approach is quite different. We believe that it is important to get all the criteria on the table and to bring all the people with an interest in these subjects together in a cooperative fashion to get as much agreement as we possibly can. I am reminded of the advice given to me by Vincent Serventy some 20 years ago, that in any contentious issue involving the environment if one gets all of the interested parties around the table one can usually get, amongst reasonable people&mdash;and most of them are reasonable&mdash;agreement on at least 90 per cent of those issues. The Government then has to make a decision on the remainder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the way in which we propose to go about it. It is quite wrong to bring about an atmosphere of conflict in these issues because it damages not only the path of economic progress, which is desperately important to us at the moment, but also the environmental considerations when genuine environmental considerations can be discredited in such a public argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to office we propose to set up a department of sustainable development to consult with all interested parties prior to Cabinet consideration. Of course, we believe unashamedly in the need for economic growth. During the worst recession in Australia for 60 years job creating enterprises must get off the ground. We see no reason why these cannot get off the ground whilst maintaining the highest environmental standards. We propose to do this through the department of sustainable development by bringing all of the parties together to get as much agreement as we can and sweep away bureaucratic obstructions. Where necessary, the Government will take decisions to get those projects ahead, achieving at the same time a balance between the need for economic growth and the need for the highest environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing we want to do is to promote growth in industries that take advantage of the expanded world market for environmental goods and services. The coalition's Fightback plan is designed to encourage investment in growth industries in Australia. There are a number of these. Communications is one such industry, but certainly environmental goods and services is another. All the elements of Fightback which attract and encourage international and domestic investment in Australia&mdash;low inflation, low taxes, a flexible labour market, low costs of services provided by instrumentalities such as those providing telephone services, power, water, transport, port facilities and so on&mdash;will be of enormous value to those firms wishing to pursue environmental goods and services for their export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is good business for Australia, as well as being aesthetically essential, for us to be a showcase environmentally around the world. If we have very high environmental standards, if we do things well here, if we control pollution well and if we attack our biggest single problem of land degradation well, then the people who have that expertise to tackle those problems and make us an international showcase will be able to set up companies to exploit those opportunities in world markets. So there is a link between the Fightback plan for development of industry and our objectives of very high environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, we are proposing an unashamed pursuit of sustainable development&mdash;economic growth with high environmental standards. There need be no conflict between the two. It is quite possible to advance the cause of human progress here and to create lasting jobs in the whole of the community by pursuing at the same time objectives of economic growth and high environmental standards. It is that objective to which we will dedicate ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward very much indeed to continuing my meetings with environmental groups, people in the business community, miners, foresters, the people involved in pollution control and the pollution control industry&mdash;all of those people who contribute in some way to the improvement of our environment. I look forward to meeting with all of them and to accepting their advice about how we should proceed, whilst balancing the various views and applying a criteria of excellence in the way in which we deal with these things. Certainly, in the process I will derive a great deal of personal enjoyment from being in a field in which I have had a very longstanding private interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House a very important and historic event which is taking place in Cowra tomorrow evening at 5.30. The event to which I refer is the official opening of the world peace bell by His Excellency Rear Admiral Peter Sinclair, the Governor of New South Wales, in Cowra. The world peace bell is made from coins and medals of the member nations of the United Nations which have been melted down to form a very large bell. The purpose of the bell is to show concern about the evils of war and to try to promote the importance of peace&mdash;a most worthy goal that I am sure all honourable members would agree is one which is deserving of support by all good and sound citizens of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most nations of the world which have peace bells have housed them in their national capitals. However, the World Peace Bell Association has awarded a peace bell to Australia. It is a gift to the Australian people, yet rather than establishing the peace bell in Canberra&mdash;which is, of course, our nation's capital&mdash;or in any of the other State capitals, Cowra has acquired the honour of being the caretaker and the home of the bell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is apparent to anybody who understands the history of Australia during the Second World War, because Cowra played a very special role in that history. Cowra was the home of a prisoner of war camp with some 1,100 prisoners. On 5 August 1944, 234 Japanese prisoners of war were killed at the camp. There were 108 prisoners injured and four camp guards were killed in what become known as the Cowra break-out. Indeed, all of the Japanese prisoners of war who escaped were rounded up in the days that followed and returned to the camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than treat that experience that they went through during the Second World War as a bitter experience, and in turn be embittered by it, the people of Cowra decided to turn to their former foes and to embrace them as their friends for the future. They did that in a rather meaningful form by the creation of the Cowra Japanese Gardens, and also through the establishment of very close personal relations with Japan. Student exchanges have been going on now for over 20 years, and of course there is a continual flow of official and unofficial visitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this process, Cowra decided to dedicate its annual festival, the Festival of the Lachlan Valley, to the theme of the promotion of international understanding.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last nearly 30 years we have had a parade of nearly 30 guest nations as part of that festival to promote international understanding in Cowra. This was recognised by the director of the multilateral disarmament section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, John Okley, when he visited Cowra on holidays in September 1988. While visiting the Japanese Gardens he made the passing comment that this would be a perfect home for the world peace bell. The current Shire President, Rod Blume, who was then the Chairman of the Cowra Tourist and Development Board, heard of this comment. He contacted me and said, `We only know that it was a person from Foreign Affairs on holidays. Can you find out who it was?'. We found out who it was and the Cowra Shire Council undertook the task of trying to persuade everybody that the world peace bell, which was being offered to Australia, should be located in Cowra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a great deal of discussion, when all the State capitals of Australia, plus of course Canberra, lobbied to get the bell, the decision was finally made that Cowra would be the home of the bell in recognition of the fact that Cowra, more than any other community in Australia, had shown by its own example over nearly 30 years that it had a commitment to the aims of the World Peace Bell Association&mdash;that is, the promotion of peace through international understanding&mdash;over and above any other community in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday, in the grievance debate, I raised an issue of considerable concern to both myself and many of my constituents: investment advisory services. Since my speech last Thursday there have been a number of comments made in the media about the criticisms I made. I would like to take this opportunity in the few minutes available to me to make a few points with regard to the criticisms. A number of people have tried to cloud the issue with other points, but the essential themes that were raised in my speech regarding investment advisory services have not been counteracted and there has been no refutation of the major points that I made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go over some of the points that I made in that speech and clarify some of the points that have been made in response by some commentators. One of the messages that have come through quite clearly from what I had to say last Thursday, and it has clearly not been refuted by any of the commentators, is that all investors should take very careful note of the expertise, the qualifications and the independence of those people who claim to be expert independent financial advisers. The point I was making in my speech on Thursday was that there are a lot of people who have set themselves up in business as financial planners or investment advisers but have very few, if any, actual qualifications to carry out that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have been criticised by some and accused of conducting a witch-hunt against certain people, none of the commentators have been able to refute the fact that most of the people who set themselves up as financial advisers do not have any academic qualifications. I believe it is very important, if one is going to be involved in giving people advice about where they should place their money in investments&mdash;we are talking about some people who may have received superannuation pay-outs of $200,000 to $300,000 and are seeking to place that money in secure financial situations so that they can live off it in their retirement&mdash;to make sure that the people providing that advice have very sound qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that just doing a part time course at a TAFE college, where they can get some 30 hours in some of the specifics about financial planning or buying stocks and shares, does not give those people the broad understanding of the workings of the economy or of the rigours and constraints that are required of an accountancy degree or a commerce degree. I believe they are fundamental foundations that all financial planners must have before they can set up as financial advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any other profession or trade has rigid qualification requirements which must be satisfied. Consumers do have safety in the knowledge that anyone who calls himself or herself a doctor, a solicitor, an accountant, or even an electrician, plumber, or carpenter, has satisfied certain qualification requirements and is registered to perform that task. If consumers have some problem with poor service that they may have received from that practitioner, then they have a body that they can go to to seek some form of redress. In fact, they can seek to have that person struck off the register if the required task is not being performed. Yet people who are placing all of their life savings in the hands of some of these financial planners have no such guarantee about the qualifications of the people who are doing that job, and they have no redress if those involved carry out their tasks in a very poor manner and fail to give the proper information about the risks that are involved in financial planning. That is the key question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a vast number of financial planners who do the right thing and have the proper qualifications and are trying to achieve a certain good quality of investment advice, but there are too many others who are not doing that. We have no way of actually being able to control this situation. None of the allegations or comments about my speech last Thursday have been able to refute the point I was making; that is, that consumers have no redress or protection at the moment. Although there is an association that is attempting to introduce a code of ethics into this industry, it has no capacity to prevent people setting themselves up and calling themselves financial advisers without the necessary qualifications. I think that is a very important point. The other point which I made in my speech, which has also not been refuted, is the incentive that exists currently for advisers to downplay or ignore risks with certain investments to gain maximum commission.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It has been my great pleasure to be involved on several occasions with the goal setting course that is run by the Brotherhood. I have met with a large number of young men and women in the electorate to chew the fat over a number of concerns that they have. Indeed, I have a letter here that they have asked me to submit to the Parliament. I will not have time to read it all tonight but I will attempt to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For those opposite to laugh at what happened today&mdash;I thought I knew them better&mdash;is,  unfortunately, a reflection on them. Today we saw what I believe was the greatest abuse of Question Time since I have been in this place. After reading part of this letter, I hope that the message will sink in. This is the message from the young people we are relying on to be the leaders of the future, the young people to whom we are saying, `Get a job, get some training and we will assist you wherever possible'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time we started acting as a parliament that had some obligations to these people. The performance at Question Time today was the most atrocious we have had in the 2 1/2 years I have been a member. The message reads:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We don't profess to know how all unemployed feel but we have ourselves and see in the faces of people in the street the feeling of Frustration, Betrayal, Defeat and the never ending ? of how am I going to survive in this economic environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people like us are motivated enough to try and get training for the future, but many especially the young and people over 50 just give up. Unless they are lucky enough to have received decent redundancy package, own their own homes and are free of debt (eg) loans, the burden to go on is too great and they lose all hope. This does not only apply to the unskilled people. Highly paid Professional and Trade people also find themselves in this predicament. Many have never been unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel it is time Petty Party Politics as well as side issues such as changing our flag are put aside and Parliament pull together to help the country back on track. We are not blaming any of you for the problems because issues overseas have a major part to play in our problems and how they are overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public need to be shown that Parliament is doing something concrete for the country and is not the "Circus" the media would like us to believe it is.

The latter plus the way the media play them up creates cynicism and harms the morale of an already moral shaken society.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very valuable lesson for every member in this House. These young people are saying that they feel frustration, betrayal and defeat. As members of parliament, we should be ashamed that we have let this country get to the stage where our young people are expressing those sorts of sentiments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on two very important events which occurred this weekend in my electorate, in Logan City in particular. The first one is of great importance and will have a great impact on the families in our electorate&mdash;the opening of the Logan Women's Health Centre. For five years we have been attempting to establish a women's health centre in our area. Only with a State Labor government were we able to get the necessary supplementary State funding and a commitment from the State Government to enable the centre to open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management committee is headed by Helen Bell and Helen O'Loughlin has become the centre's director. The centre has been placed with a range of labour market and young offender programs. It is situated near the railway station and the bus station because we believe it is particularly central to the women in Logan City. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be interested to know that the Logan Women's Health Centre has a beautiful logo, which was done by a group of young women artists. The logo consists of a butterfly emerging from the women's symbol. We hope that the symbol will become extremely well known throughout the length and breadth of Logan City and will provide opportunities for women to emerge as butterflies, in the sense that their health is important and something which is rare. As most members of this House would know and understand, women take control not only of their own health but the health of their family. It is important and central to the well-being of the family that women look after their health and care for themselves. Health is a particularly important asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of this centre is also a translation of social justice on the ground by this Government. This Government is not just talking about things: it is actually translating social justice into action. I extend my congratulations to the management committee, the director and the staff of the Logan Women's Health Centre. I know that they will become very busy and very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important event which occurred in Logan City on the weekend was the opening of the child-care centre at Logan TAFE. This is the first child-care centre to be opened at a TAFE in Queensland. This required the establishment of a State Labor government to ensure that the moneys provided by the Commonwealth Government could be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular child-care centre is important in two ways: it provides child-care for students in the community at the TAFE and also provides a valuable teaching resource and work experience for students doing the child-care diploma and certificate. This centre provides a break in the barriers for people who want to access TAFE courses. There is no point in providing courses for people if we do not take down the barriers for access to such courses and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care centre is again a tangible factor. It ensures that people with commitments and responsibilities for children can access the courses that are provided by the Logan TAFE college. It provides realistic and valuable experience for students studying there and means that we can do some work with children. I draw the attention of the House to the translation of social justice into action by this Labor Government through the child-care centre at Logan TAFE and the Logan Women's Health Centre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to bring to the attention of the House some thoughts of the late Jack Fullerton. Norma, Jack's widow and one of my constituents, has been kind enough to pass on to me some of Jack's notes about our society. These thoughts preceded the immense problems we are now experiencing. Some years ago Jack could see how our society was developing and this concerned him greatly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He decided to promote the idea of Wake Up Australia:  wake up to what is happening in our country; wake up all Australians, and alert them to the fact that we are responsible for this great continent; wake up and realise that this is a land of wonderful opportunities, largely going to waste through lack of effort and responsibility; wake up Australians to the fact that a fair day's pay is the reward for a fair day's work and ignore all the rorts so prevalent today; wake up Australians and take an active part in your union. Attend the union meetings; make sure all union decisions are in the best interests of the members; make sure all the ballots are fairly conducted and that there is no intimidation. Wake up Australians and see that the underprivileged in our society are adequately taken care of; be sure every individual contributes just a little more, whether he is employed on the factory floor, as a public servant or as a politician. We must start right now or the world will leave us behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, Jack, you were right, only the world has left us behind, so let us now wake up Australia. Jack Fullerton could obviously see how the nation was developing and how we can only reach our full potential with an effort from everybody. When we look at the condition of the nation at the moment, it is an absolute disgrace. Our once great agricultural industries are far from healthy. Our mining industries are expanding overseas and not here, mainly due to government red tape and on-costs. Our manufacturing industries, despite the claims by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), are in deep financial trouble and will need years to recover. Our service industries are a mixed group as far as prosperity is concerned. However, the big service industries, such as banking and insurance, are decidedly unhealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, it is a very grim picture and all Australians should wake up, as Jack Fullerton suggested. The message that I am sure Jack would have embraced enthusiastically today is that of Fightback, with its personal incentives, lower tax rates and employment agreements. Interestingly, it was the Prime Minister who, as Treasurer, embraced so fervently the principle of a GST. At various times in his career the Prime Minister has endorsed most elements of Fightback, and these elements apply equally as well today as they did years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Ronaldson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RT4">Mr FORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Our problems are just the same in nature but more acute and need more dramatic actions&mdash;dramatic in the way that is planned for the car industry under Fightback. The Prime Minister is offering a 15 per cent tariff by the year 2000 and some very doubtful results from award restructuring. Fightback offers 5 per cent by the year 2000 but a wealth of positive changes, including to payroll tax and wholesale sales tax&mdash;the two really big items as far as the car industry is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from making cars cheaper, the number of cars sold will obviously increase dramatically. With increased volumes, prices will drop even further. Just think of all the parts manufacturers working feverishly to keep up the supply, particularly those in the electorate of Ballarat. Fightback will be the greatest boon to the car industry in its history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is taking a tremendous risk in making this an election issue. When the facts become widely known, those people in the industry will embrace Fightback. If only the Prime Minister over his years in Parliament had realised that Australia needed awakening, not recessing&mdash;a recession which at various times we were promised we would not have but eventually had to have. Now the blame is with the gall of the coalition members who have the hide to ask the Prime Minister what he intends to do. After all, the recent financial statements have not worked. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The time has arrived in Australian sports administration where the managers of our major football codes need to understand that the games are no longer one-city based. Australian rules is no longer a Melbourne event and rugby league is no longer a Sydney event. The performance of the West Coast Eagles in the Australian rules competition has demonstrated quite conclusively the high quality of Australian rules football in the west. The dominance of the Brisbane Broncos in the rugby league competition has demonstrated similarly that rugby league is no longer, if it ever was, a Sydney game. Indeed, it is not just Brisbane in the rugby league that has demonstrated that the top quality teams are now outside of the traditional Sydney area. Tribute should be paid to Newcastle and to the Illawarra Steelers, both of whom have done exceedingly well this season; of course the Illawarra Steelers are still in the competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Brisbane, it was a matter of great joy for me to see the Brisbane Broncos succeed so convincingly yesterday in the major preliminary semifinal and to go straight into the grand final in a fortnight's time. The Brisbane Broncos, in achieving that, have established a record not seen in the Sydney competition since 1951 when the Manly club was able to go into a grand final after only five years in the competition. Indeed, when Brisbane does win the grand final in a fortnight, that will be a feat not matched since 1942 when the Canterbury side won a grand final after entering the competition in 1938. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of the Brisbane Broncos is a tribute to a lot of people. Obviously, the major credit goes to those on the field. There needs to be some recognition of the contribution of the club management and the coach who have provided outstanding leadership and organisation, throughout not just this season but a number of seasons, to take Brisbane to a premiership so soon after entering the competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read with some interest today the various commentaries on the game. Having watched the game and now read some of the commentaries, I feel some genuine pity for some of the Illawarra players who were faced with a pretty daunting prospect yesterday. Their half-back, Mick Neil, who I think is an outstanding player, had the rather daunting prospect of facing up to the world's best rugby league player, in top form, Allan Langer. I thought a very incisive and astute commentary on that came from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reporter Jeff Wells when he had this to say, commenting on Mick Neil's misfortune:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For he had run into the game's number one player, Allan Langer, who had one of those days that Catholic schoolboys aren't even allowed to dream about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a week we had been taught a sound lesson in the gulf between mere talent and genius. And that had been the point all along&mdash;until the Bronco's arrived this had been a finals series short on the best players and the best moves.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it had been. Allan Langer's performance was absolutely outstanding. It was one of the great performances. One of the amazing things about Allan Langer's game is that, although he is the smallest person on the field, he seems to have no difficulty at all in bringing down the biggest people on the field. He did that time and again yesterday in that semifinal atmosphere. I have no doubt that he will perform as well in the grand final. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a number of other players contributed to the victory in an outstanding manner. Willie Carne, Trevor Gillmeister and Terry Matterson all put in tremendous performances. It is pleasing to note that they were all part of the original team when the Broncos first formed. I know that they are excited about having joined the Broncos on day one and now steered it to a premiership final in a fortnight's time&mdash;and, I am sure, to a premiership win. It is a win which the people of Brisbane are dearly looking forward to and, dare I say it, in many ways it will help avenge those terrible years gone by when Queensland fans turned up at Lang Park to watch New South Wales players do us in every year. The Broncos have played extremely well this season. They deserve to win. They are the best side. In two weeks time, they will prove it.</PARA>

Then I moved up to the north coast, and now I reside in the Blue Mountains, which, as honourable members know, is one of the most beautiful areas in this country. It is a great honour and a privilege to serve the people of the Blue Mountains, not to mention the lovely area of the Hawkesbury, which makes up another part of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday I visited one of Australia's most visited and admired tourist spots: Echo Point at Katoomba. Everybody is familiar with the Three Sisters and the beauty and the grandeur that one beholds when standing on the parapet that looks out over the Jamieson Valley. On the left one sees the Three Sisters. On the right one sees the magnificence of the valley, the Castle and Orphan Rock.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On visiting the kiosk at Echo Point, I was presented with a new book on the Blue Mountains that updates one of the very beautiful books on the Blue Mountains that was published some time ago.

It truly is a magnificent book promoting a very special part of the world.

I commend this exhilarating area, with its magnificent climate, to all honourable members and honourable senators.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that I am what one would describe as a very equable sort of person. I do not get overly excited. But there is one thing that does rile me. That is when I am faced with institutionalised hypocrisy, deceit, sanctimonious claptrap and downright lies and distortions. I think that if one looks at the history of royal commissions in this country, one can see that all these things are very evident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have commented on the absurdity of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I know very well that, had the question been put to Aboriginals as to whether they wanted royal commissions or houses, houses would have won hands down. I want to deal with the situation in Western Australia because the distortions there have been appalling. No matter which way we add up the losses of the Western Australian Government, we cannot get to a figure of more than about $400m. The figure of $1 billion which was flaunted through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> is an indictment of the integrity of that newspaper; a newspaper that sat on its hands all through the excesses of the 1980s and now adopts the most sanctimonious of attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dwell on the treatment that has been handed out to Brian Burke. It is well known in Western Australia that I was not a supporter of Brian Burke; I was one of the very few who opposed the Burke style of government. However, it is true that under the Burke Government a lot of things were done and an enormous number of people did benefit. I find the treatment handed out to the ex-Premier unspeakable. The anti-corruption squad for the police force, a very political body, charged Mr Burke with malpractice in reference to his travel expenses. If Mr Burke is guilty of this charge, there is no doubt that so is every Minister of every government in Australia that has ever existed and 90 per cent of first division public servants. It is an absolute nonsense and I am sure it will be proved so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly is convenient for somebody in the short term to be persecuting Mr Burke in this way. But I remember the days of the black October stock crash when we saw the stock market reeling. It was in the light of that that the Burke Government was asked over a weekend to intervene to save the Rothwells Bank, a bank which the auditor assured us was financially sound but had a cash flow crisis, a view that was supported by Alan Bond and Mr Holmes a Court, both of whom were supposed to know something about cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, we know from subsequent events that that bank was actually broke in 1986. In 1986 it declared its record profit and paid a record dividend. In 1987 it declared a bigger profit and paid a bigger dividend. It is against that background that the Burke Government had to act over a weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had that Government decided that it would let Rothwells fail, the consequences would have been these: the Government would have had to find between $70m and $100m. Catholic Education had its money in there. Obviously it had to pay its teachers. The State has a statutory obligation to educate children. It would have had to have a massive expenditure either to build schools to accommodate them or to bail out Catholic Education. Clearly, there was no alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the right wing shires had their Federal road money in there. A Labor government certainly could not have said, `Sack your day workers; there will be no roads this year'. The Spastic Welfare organisation had its money in there. That amounted to over $70m, and other people were bound to come out of the woodwork. The Government held Rothwells together so that all the small investors got their money back. It saved 9 1/2 thousand jobs at the time and stabilised a very precarious stock market situation. I think they were worthy aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Senator Crichton-Browne, one of the few Liberal senators that know anything at all about the economy, said to me&mdash;and I add that he has kept his word&mdash;`You'll never hear a word out of me about Rothwells because any government would have done the same under those circumstances. The Government would be the last to know. If it happened tomorrow another government would do the same'. I would like to enlarge upon this because I think it is a very important business. I feel ashamed of the way that Brian Burke has been treated, and I will be using the forms of this House to try to redeem his name at another time.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr Free</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The lid of the canister (known as a GASCAN) containing the telescope did not open due to the operation of a safety device triggered by over-temperature conditions experienced in the Shuttle cargo bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The primary objective of the mission, as determined by Mount Stromlo &amp; Siding Spring Observatories, was the engineering validation of the performance in space of the ultra-violet detector system, as a demonstration of Australian technical and industrial capacity, and as a potential partner in a major international space project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A secondary, scientific objective was to  make measurements of the ultraviolet emission from selected celestial objects, eg. the Large Magellanic Cloud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The success criterion for the mission was the successful calibration of the detector system against the galactic ultraviolet background emission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The observational program was inhibited by the telescope's safety device.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The achievement of the objectives was compromised by the inability to undertake the observational program. Nevertheless, the payload survived the mission and operated as designed within the prevailing circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Australian Space Office and the Australian Space Board were aware of concerns raised by some individuals about perceived limitations of the selected shuttle mission. Those concerns focused on two specific areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) It was alleged that the orientation of the orbiter during the mission was such that the cargo bay and therefore the Endeavour telescope would be pointed towards the earth for the whole mission. This concept is incorrect and apparently arose from a misinterpretation of the `tail down' orientation of the orbiter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) It was alleged that the scientific objectives had been compromised, both by the supposed orientation of the orbiter, and by the lack of targeted observations in the flight plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to achieve the secondary objective of the mission, it would be necessary to point the telescope at selected celestial objects, with an accuracy of about 1 degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NASA had made it clear from the outset that they were not prepared to accept this pointing requirement as a condition of flight. Such a requirement exceeds the normal conditions for acceptance of a GASCAN mission. The pointing requirement was deleted from the formal Payload Accommodation Requirements document by the Director, Mount Stromlo &amp; Siding Spring Observatories in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Discussions on these issues were  held at various times between officials of the Space Office and the prime contractor, Auspace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such concerns were aired publicly on at least one occasion, and received substantial press coverage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8)(a) The control system of the payload was set to inhibit operation in conditions of  excessive light, ie., to protect against an inadvertent initiation of the observational sequence, and of excessive temperature in the environment of the payload. The limit was set at 50 degrees Celsius.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)  At the time of the offer of a flight on STS-42, the mission environment was expected to be within the range of operability of the Endeavour payload.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following acceptance of the offer, further detailed information on the flight profile was provided, which could be compared with the thermal characteristics of the payload. On the basis of this analysis, it was concluded that the expected thermal environment predicted by NASA was compatible with successful operation of the payload.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The temperature and light conditions in the cargo bay to which an experiment such as Endeavour would be exposed depend on a combination of the orbit of the orbiter, and the orientation of the orbiter in space.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prime factor which affects the temperature in the cargo bay is the proportion of time that the cargo bay itself is exposed to sunlight. That proportion is controlled by the passage of the orbiter through the sunlit and dark hemispheres, with a period of about 90 minutes, as well as the orientation of the orbiter itself, as determined by the flight angle and roll angle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The thermal profile of the flight refers to the temperature conditions expected to be encountered through the mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flight angle is not the prime determinant of the thermal profile. In the case of STS-42, the flight angle was always perpendicular to the earth's surface. The temperature in the cargo bay was determined primarily by the proportion of the time that the cargo bay was exposed to direct sunlight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The effect on any experiment of the thermal conditions encountered during flight depend very much on the experiment, and no general statement can be made. However, for any electronic system, there is an optimum operating temperature range, beyond which the performance of the system is degraded. Under extreme conditions, the system could sustain physical damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Analysis of the data recorded by the telescope during the flight show that the temperature experienced by the Endeavour payload exceeded, by a substantial margin, that predicted on the basis of the expected thermal profile. The flight angle is not the determining factor as explained in (10) and (11) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Concerns were raised as described in the response to (6) and (7) above. Officials of the Space Office were aware of those concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The decision was made by the Deputy Executive Director of the Space Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) The only other option available at the time would have been to reject the offer of a flight on STS-42, and seek a later opportunity. As STS-42 provided adequate opportunity to meet the primary objective of the mission there was no reason to incur further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) STS-42 was not chosen in preference to other flights. It was accepted as the first flight which provided adequate opportunity to achieve the primary objective of the Endeavour project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) Flight STS-42 was the first available flight providing adequate opportunity to meet the primary objective of the Endeavour project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) No specific information was available on other flight opportunities. The availability of space for canisters such as the one housing Endeavour is often not clear until late in the process of manifesting the Shuttle payloads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) NASA officials made no judgements on the suitability or otherwise of flight opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(20) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) See responses to (15), (16), (17) and (18).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) There was a charge of $US20 000 for payload, plus a surcharge of $US7 000 for the use of the special canister equipped with a motorised door assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other costs, directly in support of the flight totalled $794 044, which included refurbishment of the payload and visits by contractor personnel to the US for the integration of the payload into the NASA-provided GASCANs, the launch of the Space Shuttle orbiter carrying the payload, and the subsequent de-integration of the payload from the GASCANs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Communications has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 will reduce barriers to the provision of new services, requires less detailed regulation and avoids unnecessary regulatory intervention. The Act encourages the provision of new and innovative services and allows for these to be delivered by a range of existing and developing technologies, yet maintains certain obligations on broadcasters as an integral part of national identity and culture and of our democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Act facilitates new entry (more operators) and multiple radio station ownership. Radio ownership and control is significantly liberalised under the Act, with many restrictions lifted (including: foreign ownership, and national limitations) but existing cross-media limits have been retained to encourage diversity of media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new limit for radio will be the two-to-a-market maximum ownership (section 54) replacing the one-to-one market limit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More operators per market will minimise undue concentration of ownership, but the Act permits economies of scale to be realised from a degree of multiple ownership. Allowing multi-station ownership without allowing new entrants would lead to a concentration of ownership</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) A provision exists so that if there is only one commercial broadcaster in a licence area&mdash;the existing licensee may operate a second service (see section 39).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There may, initially, be an adverse impact on the profitability of existing commercial radio services, but radio broadcasters will be able to offset this by operating two stations in the same market which should allow economies to be achieved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1&amp;2) In calculating the total cost of running the Port Hedland control tower, the CAA allocated direct costs (such as the salaries of the Air Traffic Controllers), and overheads.

Corporate overheads comprise part of the costs of functions within the CAA which do not directly earn revenue, but are necessary to support the operations of revenue earning divisions; these functions include pay section, computer services and accounting and financial services.
