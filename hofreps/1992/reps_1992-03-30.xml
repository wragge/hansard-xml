<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia has made its position on human rights clear over a long time. It made its position on human rights clear again after the massacre in Dili. We expressed our objection and our abhorrence at that occurrence to the Government of Indonesia, but the seriousness with which that issue has been taken by the Indonesian authorities&mdash;their response, the response of the President, their response in relation to the military officers who were engaged in the execution of those orders&mdash;has been, as far as the Government is concerned, a credible response.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It ought to have you worried. We have had a string of commentaries on the possible implications of a consumption tax in Australia, and this is just another in the long line which raises serious reservations about this whole proposal. It is another of the GST cheer squad to come out again raising real and fundamental questions about whether or not this is a practical proposal for Australia and, certainly, whether in the context of the Opposition's policy it could ever effectively be introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this study says&mdash;as, indeed, other studies have said before&mdash;is that, if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflationary impact of a consumption tax, `GDP actually declines'. So, if real wages are maintained in the face of the inflationary pressure coming from the introduction of a consumption tax, GDP actually declines. What on earth are we trying to achieve? Something which is based on an `if'&mdash;a gigantic `if'. Mr Chisholm goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Opposition's policy is well designed, workers won't need a wage rise because they will be compensated for the effects of a GST by the tax cuts. But if&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>here we go with `if'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the trade unions don't perceive that workers have been properly compensated, then there's going to be a problem.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a gigantic problem. It is a problem which leads to a reduction in GDP. The authors of this study are not the first who have come up with this hair-raising warning which the Opposition seems intent on turning aside. It is not interested in these warnings, because it is not the first time it has had them. Dr Murphy from the ANU said that if&mdash;again, this word `if'&mdash;wage increases were obtained to compensate for the inflationary effect of the GST, GDP would be 4 per cent lower within five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a policy about which the warnings are becoming daily more intense: that if we cannot keep the inflationary consequences out of the wage system GDP will actually decline. The Opposition says, `That is okay, because we have a wages policy'. Search as we might for some reference to the wages policy within the Opposition's documents, within the 800 pages what we find is this&mdash;</PARA>

Here we have incontrovertible evidence that in fact people are going to be worse off as a result of this introduction. What is clearly said by this study, again on top of the Murphy study, is that unless one can convince workers that they do not have to maintain their real wages to compensate for this introduction, the impact will go into wages and GDP will fall. What is the point of such a policy if all one wants to do is contract the economy to actually reduce the size of the Australian economy by 4 per cent?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's Statement completes the program announced in the Economic Statement of May 1988.</PARA>
<PARA>It completes the program; that is, the end points 25, 15, 5 and zero were the completion of the program. A day after the statement, I said on the Haydn Sargent program in Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So if you take clothing and footwear, that tax is going to be down from 35 to 15 per cent. . . In other words, that's at the end of the section; that's at the end of the phase down.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because it's got to be phased.</PARA>
<PARA>This started in the package of 1987-88 and the phase-in will complete in 1997 and the year 2000. I also made the following point to the honourable member for Barker in the House of Representatives on 17 September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shadow Minister has an objective of a zero tariff level by the year 2000, as I understand it.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average level of protection increased during the seven years of the Fraser Government. This Labor Government has reduced protection levels. But we make decisions about whether we want industries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>For instance, we want a car industry. We know that a car industry will not function at zero protection levels, but apparently those opposite believe that at a zero level of protection a car industry will remain viable. It will not. The Opposition is really saying it does not want a car industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on and made it very clear in further references in that answer that I did not believe a zero level by the year 2000 in cars was desirable or achievable. I made it obviously and patently clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tariff levels which obtained were these: in 1983-84 the effective level with respect to clothing was 222 per cent, falling to 52 per cent as a result of the March 1991 program. For clothing and footwear it was 227 per cent, down to 50 per cent. That is in the Industry Commission report, if honourable members bother to look. With respect to motor vehicles, it has fallen from 250 per cent to 36 per cent. Mr Speaker, you will see a graph in the Industry Commission's report which, in the same period, shows a falling level of protection under this Government but rising during the period of the Fraser Government when the Leader of the Opposition was the principal economic adviser. I table for the interest of honourable members a photocopy of that graph.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point it makes is that two million jobs would be created by abolishing seven unfair taxes and rebuilding business. These are the two million jobs which the Leader of the Opposition said was a guesstimate which came out of an economic projection which did not even model the GST. The GST which actually replaces the seven taxes so referred to was not even modelled. The Leader of the Opposition said in his media statement of 27 February:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fightback was not&mdash;repeat not&mdash;modelled.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the two million jobs which he described as a guesstimate on his part are now claimed at the top of the pamphlet, and claimed in relation to the GST which replaces the seven taxes, even though he says that the GST was not part of the modelling exercise and that Fightback was not modelled. In other words, the pamphlet is a fraud. It goes on to say at point 6:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Duties to be ABOLISHED.</PARA>

In fact, the Treasurer pointed out recently in a ministerial statement on the GST that the estimated price effects of the Opposition's package by the Treasury on food products generally will be 8.9 per cent overall. Dairy products will increase by 9.6 per cent, cereal products will increase by 9.2 per cent and fresh fruit and vegetables by 10.1 per cent&mdash;hardly marginal!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, some of the announced increases are already in place in relation to extending the availability of rent assistance to those singles under 18. In addition, the other payments will be made this week in relation to family allowance. They were decisions made before any Wills by-election was announced or considered. They were part of the February statement, designed, above all else, to inject an impetus into this economy. That is the prime purpose of those one-off payments of family allowance. Of course, the follow-up payments in relation to the family allowance supplement are intended to provide a continuing increased support for low income families in this society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what we hear in contrast to what this Government is doing are proposals that there should be massive cuts in social welfare. I understand that there has been a proposal that there should be a 30 per cent cut in social welfare payments. I understand that that originates from the Liberal candidate for Wills, Mr John Delacretaz. I find it inconceivable that any figure in public life in this country could make a suggestion of a 30 per cent cut in social welfare payments. I gather that he is also in favour of sending all unemployed migrants back home. I gather that he is also inclined to axe the subsidy paid to some rival duster company which employs disabled people; that should be cut off too. This gives us a real insight into the type of candidate put forward by the Liberal Party in Wills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noticed no effort whatsoever to distance the Liberal Party from this candidate to repudiate these kinds of views. Of course, that is not that surprising. In many ways the Fightback package is a sophisticated version in a number of areas of the rather crude comments made by the Liberal candidate for Wills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look for instance at unemployment benefits. If you follow the man from Wills, you could cut the social welfare benefit to the unemployed by 30 per cent. That would reduce the payments to those on Job Search allowance by $84.60 a fortnight. That is what a 30 per cent cut means&mdash;$84.60 a fortnight. Or, of course, you could do it in a more subtle way&mdash;you could change the eligibility for Job Search groups. That may sound a bit far fetched, but when you read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS>, you realise that that is exactly what the Opposition proposes for many of the long term unemployed; that is, they will have their unemployment benefits cut off after nine months.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your own spokesperson makes no equivocation about cutting off those payments after nine months. That would cut out some 90,000 unemployed. Therefore, you would have a massive cut&mdash;not the crude 30 per cent of the candidate for Wills, but a very effective cut&mdash;in social welfare benefits by changing eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You could do exactly the same with the family support arrangements. Mr Delacretaz would suggest that you cut that by 30 per cent. Or you could, as the Opposition does in Fightback, change the eligibility rule for the sole parent's pension; that is, remove the pension as soon as the youngest child turns 12.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the candidate for Wills that those sorts of cuts would affect some 11,000 families in Wills. Of course, the Opposition is more subtle and sophisticated than that. What it is saying is that it will change the eligibility rules for the family allowance. All the rules about income that will apply in relation to families are not quite clear from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document but, taking the most conservative view, it would mean that some 190,000 families across Australia would be denied family allowance. That would mean that about 1,000 families in Wills would simply go off family allowance as a result of the Fightback proposals. I think the Wills electorate is beginning to realise that Mr Delacretaz is very much a supporter of the cuts proposed by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;cuts which would destroy and slash the safety net for social welfare that we have provided in this country.</PARA>

This measure is expected to encourage an additional 9,000 first-year apprentices during 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>

It includes $5m to provide a wage subsidy to employers of second-year apprentices at risk of retrenchment. Some 3,200 young people are expected to be helped by this measure. Before the One Nation statement, the Government extended other measures which will add some 7,000 young people who can expect to be helped by those changes. Last week the honourable member for Dunkley asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Prime Minister know that this group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is called Inner Northern Group Training&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">now has more than 250 out-of-work apprentices on its books?</PARA>
<PARA>Today I received a letter on this subject from Inner Northern Group Training Ltd, which I will read to the House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday last, the 26th of March, you were asked a question by Mr F. Ford, member for Dunkley. The question asked whether you were aware of the existence of my company, Inner Northern Group Training Ltd, which he erroneously stated had `250 out-of-work apprentices on their books'. The fact of the matter is that we have more than 150 apprentices on our books who are employed. We do have a register of apprentices made out-of-trade by other employers: but not by us. Those out of work apprentices are not `on our books'. We keep this register to assist our speedy placement of them when we find additional positions. . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, for the last two years we have consistently averaged placing another 80 apprentices per year, (nearly 7 per every month) in employment. After taking our graduations into account, we have increased our numbers of apprentices and trainee employees from 107 at 1 July 1990 to 152 today. Not only have we increased our number of apprentices and trainees; we have also expanded a career advisory service and we are also running pre-employment courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This misrepresentation of our company's performance alone is sufficiently galling to my Board and Staff, but it has already had commercial repercussions for us, with a number of our clients phoning us to ask us if the company was `in difficulties'. Such rumours, which are totally unfounded and lacking in substance, can lead to clients deserting our successful organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, however, has not been the worst impact.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen estimates, and they are commonly accepted estimates, about what is required to bring vocational education and training expenditures up to acceptable levels in this community. They were made last year by the Finn committee and were consistent with earlier projections by the Deveson review of training costs and award restructuring. They recommended that the annual cost expenditures of TAFE and training should rise between $800m and $1 billion over 1991 levels by the end of the decade; that is, in each year, somewhere between $800m and $1 billion ought to be spent if we are to achieve acceptable levels of participation in vocational education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package offers progress right on target for achievement of that expenditure. It offers full Commonwealth responsibility for the funding of vocational education and training, the establishment of legislated guaranteed training or funding and growth totalling $720m over the 1993-95 triennium. That rate of growth, as I said, is on a trajectory to achieve the Finn Committee projections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an alternative proposal from the Opposition in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document.

Further on we are told that the Liberal and National parties will:</PARA>

<PARA>That is not $520m per annum, that is $520m in total that the Liberal and National parties will be prepared to provide over the rest of this decade. If that is going to be the Opposition's objective, and were it to get into office, instead of achieving close to the $800m to $1 billion by the end of the decade it would merely be falling some $900m short.

It was, firstly, a misrepresentation of the Opposition and, secondly, a slur on a profession that has been happy to provide advice, on an apolitical basis, to both sides of politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance for discussion today, the disastrous collapse of investment and employment in Victoria caused by the policies of the Prime Minister and his Victorian political allies, is timely because this week marks the tenth anniversary of the Labor Government in Victoria&mdash;a government generally regarded as being the worst in Victoria's history and among the worst in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a commentary on the Prime Minister's great flexibility that in its dying days the Victorian Government has a new best friend&mdash;the Prime Minister.

He is indeed the flexible man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the record of this Victorian Government, which is now so pally with our flexible Prime Minister? The unemployment numbers are revealing. When Cain and Kirner came to office the unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent, compared with the rest of Australia at that time of 7.2 per cent. The unemployment rate in Victoria is now 12.3 per cent, compared with the rest of Australia&mdash;as at the February figures&mdash;at 11.3 per cent. We all know that those numbers are phoney. For example, if a person gets an hour's work once in a while he or she is excluded from the official unemployment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment rate is partly a reflection of a dramatic decline in investment. Overall, Australian business investment dropped 13 per cent in the December quarter and is expected to fall further during 1992. Investment creates jobs, yet in Victoria both private sector and government investment have fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an extraordinary display of irresponsibility, the Victorian Government has increased current spending and allowed capital spending to fade away. This has happened because the public sector unions threatened the Government with disruption and its members with the loss of their preselections. To ensure an increase in public sector salaries and conditions, the unions then offered the carrot in the form of preselection donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Cain boasted of cranes on the Melbourne skyline while investment in manufacturing and in export industries was declining and leaving the State. The result of the Victorian Government's policies has been lower economic growth for the Cain and Kirner governments and for the rest of Australia and lower investment and higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incredibly, the Victorian Government has managed a prodigious increase in government debt. The Paul Keating debt prize, of course, goes to the Prime Minister. But what the Prime Minister has done to our external debt, Cain and Kirner have done to Victoria's internal debt. No-one truly knows the extent of the Victorian Government's debt obligations because the books have been hidden, manipulated and subjected to a series of creative accounting practices. But this debt could be as high as $60 billion and the young people of Victoria will be paying off this debt for the next two generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt situation is a savage commentary on the policies of the Prime Minister and his Victorian political allies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premiers Cain and Kirner will also be leaving us something else&mdash;and that is a trail of destruction in our public institutions. A decade of ALP Government has politicised the Victorian Public Service in a way not seen since Federation. Those who have been promoted by Labor through political influence are commonly known in the Victorian Public Service as the `comrades'. These comrades have demoralised many experienced and dedicated senior and middle officers in the Victorian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This blatant playing of politics&mdash;the promotion of party hacks and the persecution of those in the Victorian Public Service of an independent mind&mdash;probably has no equal in the history of public administration in this nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Federal Government&mdash;the Keating Government and Treasurer Keating&mdash;made a major contribution to the debacle in Victoria. The Federal Government created a climate which gave encouragement to spend up at the height of the boom. The then Treasurer Keating applied a money supply crunch which has flattened Victoria's manufacturing base. The Nissan motor car company has closed; General Motors has basically moved its manufacturing operations to South Australia; and, as reported last week, the Ford Motor Co. has made huge losses in the Keating-inspired recession. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other problems in Victoria that have led to the collapse of investment and employment as a result of Federal and State Labor Party policies.

The State Electricity Commission is over-manned, indifferently managed and crippled by work rorts. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The teacher unions are now in control of the Victorian government schools and the syllabus, with a decline in standards, a decline in literacy and a decline in numeracy that has led the vice-chancellors of some of Victoria's tertiary institutions to speculate on whether entrance examinations to those institutions would be appropriate. In the eastern suburbs region, at the demographic centre of Melbourne, there is disintegrating infrastructure and declining public services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that the one bright sign in Victoria's economic mess is a shift towards corporatisation, privatisation and contracting out, unfortunately not because the Government sees these as ways to improve productivity and international competitiveness, but rather because the State is broke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech we have just heard would probably have been better delivered in the Victorian State Parliament rather than in the Federal Parliament. Anyone listening to the speech, which was basically a diatribe against the Victorian Government, would be interested to know that, despite all that was alleged by the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), employment has grown much faster in Victoria since the Cain and Hawke governments came to office than previously, before Labor governments came in.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say, particularly for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith), that over the whole period when the Fraser Government was in office&mdash;7 1/4 years&mdash;the growth in employment in Victoria was 5.8 per cent, a growth of 63,000. In the period since the Labor Government came in federally, employment in Victoria has grown by 300,000. This represents a growth in employment in Victoria of 18 per cent, compared with less than 6 per cent under the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is saying that things are terrible in Victoria, that there has been a particularly bad economic record but, had there been a continuance of the employment growth in Victoria at the rate that it was under the Fraser Government, there would be 220,000 fewer people employed in Victoria now. There would be 220,000 fewer if the Fraser Government employment growth rates had continued through to the present time. There has been a vastly different employment scene in Victoria. There are 220,000 more people employed than there would have been if the Fraser Government employment growth rates had continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us acknowledge that Victoria and all parts of Australia have been through hard times in the last 18 months, but let us also bear in mind that the rate of growth in employment in this country&mdash;not just in Victoria but all through it&mdash;has been vastly greater under this Government than under the previous Government. Despite all the employment loss in the last year and a half, we still have growth rates which are three times greater than the employment growth that occurred under the previous Government. In Victoria, which has been particularly adversely affected by the recession, it is still the case&mdash;there is a vastly greater number of people employed, 220,000 more, than would have been the case had the Labor governments not come to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a starting point to try to get the comments of the honourable member for Bruce into some perspective. Of course, the irony of his address to the House today is that if the Opposition were in office it could hardly be expected that there would be any improvement in Victoria. In fact, Victoria has been affected in some respects by the recession more than the rest of Australia because it has more protected industry. It is being affected not just by the recession but also by the structural adjustments more than most other States. In that respect, of course, it can be expected to be feeling the pain a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would the Opposition be doing to assist if it were to get into office now? We have been through the protection debate in recent times in this place, including Question Time today, and everyone in this House is now very much aware that if the Opposition were to get into office federally it would embark on a course which would see that the motor vehicle industry and the textile, clothing and footwear industries would be subject to a much faster rate of adjustment&mdash;that is, a faster rate of loss of protection&mdash;than would be the case under this Government. Even though we are instituting a substantial reduction in protection for those industries, it would happen even more quickly under the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, raises real questions about whether there would any such industry left. Two major companies in Victoria&mdash;Toyota and Ford&mdash;have made it clear that, despite the protection regime that is being imposed on them by the present Government, the investment programs that they are prepared to institute are substantial. In the case of Toyota it means going to a new plant at Altona, where it will build a world-class facility which will be able to produce the new model Camry in a way which will allow it to be exported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Corolla, but particularly the Camry. It is being built particularly for the Camry, and the Camry will be exported to other countries. So it is building a major export industry&mdash;a world-class facility, a state-of-the-art facility. It is investing $420m in this state-of-the-art factory in Victoria because of various assessments it makes about the future, included amongst which is the protection regime projected by the present Government. As was said at Question Time, the fact that Opposition members were running around talking about reducing protection to zero imperilled that investment decision. If they had been in office telling the world that there would be zero protection, we can certainly assume, I think pretty rightly, that that investment would not have gone ahead, because instead of 15 per cent at the end of this decade there would have been zero.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get to 15 per cent, protection must be reduced at a rate of about 2 1/2 per cent per annum; this year it goes to 35 per cent, reducing by 2 1/2 per cent per annum for eight years to 15 per cent. If it were zero, that rate of reduction would be about 4.4 per cent per annum, which is a much faster rate of reduction in protection. I suggest that companies would simply say, `It is just not possible for us to make productivity improvement at that rate and certainly imperils our investment much more. Even if it might be possible, it is obviously much more questionable; therefore, it is just not worth the candle. We will supply Thailand or South East Asia with their Camrys from Japan or from some other facility, but not from Australia'. They would not invest here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we did was lay down a protection regime that was designed to strip away that degree of protection which was unnecessarily high, but at least leave a level of protection that would give us a good industry which was efficient by world standards. The case of Toyota proves that that is what is happening. It is getting a world-class factory to produce a state-of-the-art car which can sell on export markets. It is getting that because it assesses that with the overall protection regime in place, the investment is viable. Most likely it would not make that assessment if it was zero. That would make the increase in productivity much faster than is otherwise the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In assessing what increase in productivity is necessary to keep up with the reducing protection regime, companies have to take account of the fact not only that they need to keep up with that reduction in protection but also that competitors, or plants in other countries which may be from the same multi-national company, are increasing their productivity rapidly as well. What we need is a much faster rate of productivity growth than simply that which is coming from the reduced protection regime if people are going to stay in the game and  make the investment viable. The Opposition in this place would have imperiled that investment&mdash;it did imperil it, even from Opposition. What could we expect if it were in government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is also true for Ford, whose Broadmeadows factory is located just outside the Wills electorate. It has committed itself to an investment of $800m in the next five years, 60 per cent of which, according to the chief executive, Mr Nasser, is for new ventures; that is, not just for maintaining the current facilities and updating them as generally required, but branching out into major new areas of new products or new quality of products, and basically expanding and improving the business. Would Ford be doing that if it had zero tariffs by the year 2000, which would obviously make that major investment much more dubious in terms of giving a return to the shareholders? Of course it would be much more loath to make that investment. In those circumstances there would be a much-reduced Ford factory in the Broadmeadows area and a much-reduced level of employment possibilities for the people of Wills&mdash;many of the work force of the Broadmeadows Ford plant coming from the Wills electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite would have instituted a tariff regime which would have meant that in respect of the Toyota plant in Altona, the Broadmeadows plant, and the Geelong plant, which is the other major facility for Ford, also in Victoria, new investment would most likely not have taken place; yet they stand here and parade themselves around as though through bringing in a GST they will be able to produce some miracle in Victoria. We all know that that is total nonsense. It has been proved time and time again since the GST package was brought down that the two million jobs are just a pipedream; that there is no substance in it whatever; that it is a total deception of the Australian people to talk in those terms; and that all that Opposition members have to offer the Australian people is a level of protection which would mean that in key areas such as the vehicle industry there would be far fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation applies also to the TCF industries, which are very significant in Victoria, particularly in the Wills electorate. There again we would see a much faster rate of reduction of protection by the people opposite, taking it to zero by the year 2000, meaning no protection at all for clothing, textiles and footwear and that the 25 per cent and 15 per cent rates that we have said would apply would not be there. All those firms would be going out of business at a much faster rate or not bothering to restructure, because it is impossible&mdash;the task is too great. They would be giving up the ghost and walking away&mdash;which under our program many of them will not do, given that there will be a substantive protection regime available by the year 2000. That gives them an incentive to try to make it, and some certainly will make it. They will make it very well and may even get into exports. The proportion that make it would certainly be far less if there was zero protection, because they would see the task as too immense and too perilous for their shareholder funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thing is about what is an achievable rate of reduction in protection. We are not saying we think good protection is great or terrific. The point has been amply made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;I simply reiterate it&mdash;that it is about the rate and pace of change. We are saying that there comes a point when we have to institute a rate of change which industry can live with. Those opposite would simply give a rate which would be disastrous for those industries and, effectively, wipe them out in this country and have disastrous employment effects in Wills and Victoria generally. </PARA>

Some of them will have particularly important effects in Victoria. </PARA>

That involves significant improvements in productivity in the way in which not only the rail system operates, particularly in the Dynon terminal, but also in terms of the rail practices which are instituted by the rail unions in operating the system. Unless those improvements are forthcoming, that investment will not be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also major development for roads in Victoria, the western ring road particularly. A major investment by this Government of $75m is helping to develop a road which will be uniquely important in linking a series of interstate highways; directing a lot of traffic easily from one highway to another without its having to go through the centre of Melbourne, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of that system; and also upgrading the international terminal and building common user facilities at the airport&mdash;both of which will improve Melbourne Airport and make it a more attractive facility. This One Nation statement is very much about giving this economy a kick along, getting back to the kind of employment growth rates we have had in the past, and, in the process, ensuring that by various infrastructure improvements Victoria is given a real chance to maintain major growth in the 1990s. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

For example, in the rest of Australia during the period of the Cain and Kirner  governments in Victoria, growth in jobs was 19 per cent, whereas in Victoria it was just 13.9 per cent. In February 1982 the unemployment figure in Victoria was 6.7 per cent, while in the rest of Australia it was 7.2 per cent. By February 1992 this year, in Victoria it has blown out to 12.3 per cent, but in the rest of Australia, starting from a higher base of 7.2, it is still only 11.3 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On any estimate, as the honourable member for Ballarat says, that is devastation in the State of Victoria. If we look at economic growth over the period 1980-81 to 1990-91, we see growth in the rest of Australia of 3 per cent per annum, yet in Victoria we see economic growth at the rate of only 2.5 per cent per annum. They are the statistics about which the Cain and Kirner governments in Victoria ought to be judged, not a false comparison with any other era. A week or so ago we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) trying to make a comparison between his years and the Menzies years. In his comparison he conveniently failed to quote the figures which, on just about every level of economic performance in this country, showed that the economic performance in the 1950s exceeded that of the 1980s. This is the sort of nonsense that we get, and it is the first point, the first plank, in the argument of the Minister for Finance when addressing this major issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some other statistics that relate to Victoria: jobs have been lost at the rate of 3.5 per cent compared with 1.1 per cent for the rest of Australia; unemployment has risen at the rate of over 30 per cent compared with 22 per cent for the rest of Australia; the number of unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 19 looking for their first full time job increased by 73 per cent in Victoria compared with just 49 per cent in the rest of Australia; the number of unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 19 looking for a full time job has risen by 51 per cent in Victoria compared with 22 per cent Australia-wide. One could continue to quote these statistics which, figure after figure, point to the devastation in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at retail turnover over 12 months to January 1992 as an indicator of economic performance, we see that in Victoria it has increased by just 3 per cent whereas in the rest of Australia it has increased by 5.3 per cent. The number of new dwellings approved has increased in the rest of Australia by 15.4 per cent, but there has been a decrease in Victoria of 3.3 per cent. New vehicle registrations, another indicator of economic performance, have increased in the rest of Australia by 4.4 per cent and there has been a 1.8 per cent increase in Victoria. Over the 12 months to September 1991 there has been an increase in social security beneficiaries of 45.4 per cent in Australia, which is bad enough, but the figure for Victoria is 82.6 per cent. This is the great State that was handed on to the Cain and Kirner governments and the devastation that has been wrought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister then turned to the tariff debate. The Prime Minister has been endeavouring to juggle the ball all week trying to decide whether he is an economic rationalist or the great protector of industry. He does not quite know what he is, although he can stand up shamelessly in the Parliament and somehow claim to be both. Hopefully the economic writers will perceive that he is still an economic rationalist. I suppose he wants the people in the electorate of Wills to see that he is the last of the great protectionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister talks about Ford and Toyota. He conveniently talks about building a new plant for Toyota, but he ought to have mentioned that two other plants are going to be closed down. If he talks to any of the workers who happen to be at Toyota, they will say quite clearly that the number of jobs available in the future at Toyota will be decreased. We have built this great new plant, but at the cost of closing down two other plants and at the cost of further jobs in the future. When we talk about Ford, we see that there has certainly been some special pleading by it and others in the motor industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the managing director of Ford, Mr Nasser, said that, even with the existing tariff reform, the program could force Ford to close down. Of course, it has not closed down, even with the existing program. Now he says that the zero tariffs could make new investments hard to justify. He says that is assuming nothing else changes in today's conditions. The `nothing else' is the nothing else that the Government conveniently does not wish to quote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mentioning productivity, did anyone talk about micro-economic reform? We talk about tariff reduction as if the only way in which we are going to increase productivity is to build new railway lines and new roads. It is the new program of the three Rs: roads, plus railways equals recovery. Government members should go and sell that to the people of Wills. It is simply not on. Even if we have the brightest, best and straightest new railways in the country, if we do not have micro-economic reform and we continue to have the union practices that exist in this country, and particularly in Victoria, then we will not make any difference at all. We are trying to disadvantage industry in this country. The great difference between our policies and the Government's policies is that we are prepared to tackle both sides of the problem, not simply the tariff problem alone. Of course, we will not hear any mention of that from the Prime Minister or from the Minister for Finance today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on and compare what has happened in Victoria with the rest of Australia over the years of the Cain and Kirner governments. When Mrs Kirner came to power she said that she was going to start afresh and that the Party was dumping John Cain because of financial mismanagement under him as Premier. But 18 months later we have the Premier conceding that the State is worse off than when she took over as Premier. We now have a situation where investment continues to drop in Victoria and people are leaving the State in droves. That is an interesting statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of John Cain's time as Premier, 897 people were leaving Victoria each month. The monthly exodus of Victorians has now jumped to 1,349. Victorians are voting with their feet and going elsewhere. We heard the old truism, `Nero fiddled while Rome burned'. Today Mrs Kirner is being photographed while Victoria is being raped. That gives a whole new meaning to video porn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a disastrous situation in Victoria. If the Prime Minister was right and it was a lack of political will on the part of his Party at the time that led him to jettison the consumption tax, and if the economy required the measures which he says he took to prevent it overheating, then he is now in a position to implement all that he fought for then. But the slightest electoral test on the horizon is Wills. This seat is not going to bring the Government down; it is one seat. The Government is still going to have quite a reasonable majority even if it loses Wills. But what happens? At the first puff of the breeze, the first electoral test for the Prime Minister, we are scrapping policies. We are running away as fast as we can from tariff reform now, if that is what we are to believe the Prime Minister is saying. We are not sure what he actually means and what he will say after the Wills by-election, but he is running away from that just as he ran away from the consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) started off this expose, he talked in particular about the State Bank of Victoria and the fact that the Commonwealth Bank had to bail it out. Yes, of course this happened, and no-one liked it happening. But let me go on to the real reason for it and look at the Liberal Opposition's alternatives to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason for the collapse of the State Bank in Victoria can be taken back to one decision and one decision alone&mdash;the failure of the Cain Government to reject philosophy that it should allow the State Bank to take on a merchant bank; that it should allow the State Bank to engage in the normal commercial activities of the private banking sector. Had the Cain Government taken the advice to keep away from this privatisation nonsense, this private sector commercialisation nonsense, the State Bank would not have got itself into the situation it got into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does it come to be that the Commonwealth Bank is in a position to pick up the State Bank of Victoria, and whatever else may come to it down the track? It is in a position to do that because the Federal Government rejected the very same advice. The Commonwealth Bank was not allowed to take on a merchant banking arm. The bank had a defined role in the economy, a public sector role, and it was kept to that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the proposal coming forward from this crew on the other side of the House? More of the same! Privatisation is the idea: `Let us now take the Commonwealth Bank and sell it off to the private sector', the very same whiz-bangs that led the State Bank down the road. Let us look at the ideological star of those opposite in Victoria, Mr Elliott. He is the one who drives their policies in Victoria. Let us look at what he has managed to achieve. He has managed to put the political party of those opposite in tatters. He has managed to wind up the brewery, and it has had to get rid of him. Elders has had to get rid of him. He has even managed to stuff up my football club!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this sort of ideologically driven private sector drive that those opposite say is the answer for Victoria is in fact more of exactly the same thing that the Victorian State Labor Government should always have rejected. That will be my criticism of that Government&mdash;its failure to reject the sort of drivel that these people opposite are still coming forward with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the alternatives coming on deck from the Federal Labor Government. The last speaker for the Opposition, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), was attempting to down-play the initiatives announced in the One Nation statement relating to transport reform. Nowhere in Australia does anybody stand to benefit more from the tying together of the national rail system than Victoria, with the National Rail Corporation bringing the rail network from Brisbane to Melbourne and from Perth to Melbourne. Nowhere in Australia does a city and a people stand to benefit more than will Melbourne from the sensible tying together of the waterfront, the airport, rail and road in the way that the $500m that we have now put on the table will do. Nowhere in Australia are there more benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition had 30 years to do something about six different State rail systems and six different State waterfront authorities, and now would even take the one Federal structure, the Melbourne airport structure&mdash;the major growth and job centre built around decent planning, decent social policy and education facilities&mdash;and flog it off to whoever wants to buy it. It is the major growth centre in the north-west of Melbourne where there will be 20,000 people working by the year 2000. What is the magic answer of those opposite to that? It is to flog it off to John Elliott and his crew. I tell them now that that would happen only over my dead body; I make that as clear now as I can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, what is the proposal of those opposite for Victoria? It is, as they say, to abolish seven little taxes and, instead, to bring in one great big one called the GST. I will have a little wager with any member of the Opposition who wants to take me up on this: I guarantee that within the next two months the leader of the Liberal Party in the State Parliament of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, will be running as far away from the consumption tax as he possibly can. He will be unloading himself of this because he knows that Victorians will not cop it. </PARA>

Some of those companies that involved themselves in that activity during the decade of the 1980s were in fact basing their share price on glamour, hype, takeover and easy credit, and, when circumstances changed and the Australian stock market turned down, some of those companies were caught short. </PARA>

Investors who put their money into those companies were entitled to expect that they were going to be protected against fraud; in some very notorious cases they were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also, of course, creditors&mdash;people who traded with some of these companies, who sold goods or sold the service&mdash;waiting for payment, who as a result of collapse have not received that payment. They have given their goods or service and the company has gone down before payment. They find that they have lost their goods or their service and never received recompense for it. I believe what galls those creditors and investors is when they see themselves out of pocket as a creditor or an investor and they go without as a result and yet they see some of those who were operating those companies living very well, thank you very much, without showing any financial strain whatsoever because of the collapse of the company, without going without the necessities of life in the same way as the creditors or the shareholders are, and who seemingly appear immune from the processes of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This galls the basic sense of honesty of Australian citizens, and they have every reason to be galled. They have every reason to be galled when they turn on their television and they see somebody living high on the hog, overseas, while they are living in straightened circumstances at home, they having lost their money, and the person overseas seemingly having kept the proceeds or having kept the directors' fees or having kept the fees that came out of the management company that advised the public company on highly remunerative terms. It is not just the injustice of that situation; it is the basic lack of confidence it gives to Australian investors, the people whom we want to encourage to invest in Australian equities, the basic lack of confidence that if one puts one's money into the stock market one is going to be protected against fraud. Let me make it clear: nobody says to a person, and nobody should ever believe, that if he puts his money into the stock market he is safe from risk. He will never be safe from risk. When he puts his money into a company, he invests in the hope of a profit by way of dividend or a capital gain by way of the movement of share price. But he is entitled to be protected against fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look back over that decade, we can think of a handful of cases of high profile people who seem to be still doing very well and have not been brought to justice. We are entitled as a parliament to ask why. Why is that the case? Why is it that people who come readily to mind do not seem to have been brought to justice? I should make it clear that, until somebody has been brought into a court of law and been convicted on the evidence that has been brought into the court of law, that person is innocent. I am not saying that all those people are guilty. What I am saying is: why have we not brought the charges into the courts? Why have we not had the opportunity to bring those charges and to hear the evidence in a court of law, the proper place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look back, we do see there were some obvious failures in relation to corporate administration over the last five to 10 years. Firstly, the funding for those who were enforcing the law was inadequate. There is no question about that. Now, with the advent of the Australian Securities Commission, that funding has been improved, and the improvement of funding to the Australian Securities Commission has the full support of the Federal Opposition. Secondly, there was the opportunity, with six State regulators and one national regulator, for those various regulators not to take full responsibility as a result of the overlap of functions, and it was not uncommon for somebody to say, `It is not our fault; it is their fault'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we had six State regulators enforcing laws against companies operating across State borders it was possible for none of those agencies to take responsibility. Therefore, this Parliament decided there would be one national regulator. The Federal coalition supported that. The idea of one national regulator, accountable to one national parliament, was that there would be accountability. If there were one regulator, we would know who to blame if things went wrong. We would know who to congratulate if things went right. If there was one parliament which had responsibility, that parliament could take responsibility. It is in fact incumbent upon this Parliament to take responsibility in this area, just as it is incumbent on the Australian Securities Commission to take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission announced some 18 months ago that it had a hit list of 16 cases that it was actively investigating. I think it was unwise to announce what those companies were, but it announced them some 18 months ago. It issued a progress report in February 1992. It said that, of those 16, six have resulted in charges before the courts; in two, investigations have been completed and no charges are appropriate; in three of the others, there was some civil proceeding. But that still leaves eight outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission said in respect of these eight cases that briefs have either been delivered to the Director of Public Prosecutions or will be delivered. It is incumbent upon us as a Parliament to show some interest in those briefs. We are responsible, as is the agency, and we ought to make it clear to the public that we are interested in the completion of all investigations. We do believe it is important to complete these things as soon as possible and to bring these matters before courts of law if that is appropriate, or to close the files if it is inappropriate. But, after 18 months, there is still a way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funny thing is that when charges have actually been brought before the courts there has been a good success rate. The Chief Justice of Western Australia spoke at a conference in this Parliament recently. He said that in that State three charges had been brought against directors under the old section 229. He said that in respect of those three charges there had been three convictions. So there would be no trouble with the courts enforcing the law; the trouble really is getting the charges into the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not brook the argument that the law was not good enough and that was why prosecutions have not been brought. We had a lot of law throughout that period&mdash;we had about six inches of law. The problem was not that we did not have enough laws; the problem was that we did not enforce the laws that we did have. If we take our eyes off the main game&mdash;the main game being enforcing the laws against those who may have transgressed them&mdash;we will continue with this long running saga of companies which are subject to complaint and investigation never seeming to have those investigations finalised in the proper place, a court of law, in accordance with justice, which the public is entitled to expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be borne in mind, as this Parliament confronts the issue of amending corporations law again, that amendments to the corporations law as it now stands are not for the purpose of bringing to justice those who offended during the 1980s. They will have to be brought to justice under the laws as they stood then. The proposals which we have before us are not to have retrospective effect. I believe, in relation to those laws and in relation to that small band of notorious persons, that the laws as they stood in the 1980s were adequate. The question is to bring the charges. The important thing is to make it clear to the public, the Australian Securities Commission and the Government, that progress is expected and that the chapter of the 1980s must be closed under the laws of the 1980s</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that clear at the outset because we are now talking about amending the privilege against self-incrimination under the corporations legislation. It is important to note that in this debate we are talking about amending that prospectively. No-one can stand up and claim that this Bill will make prosecution of the notorious promoters of the 1980s easier. It is not retrospective, and I congratulate the Attorney-General on that. It will apply only if people are required to produce books or make statements under the provisions of the ASC Act or the corporations law after the coming into force of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people whose names are on our minds and tongues when we talk about the corporate crooks of the 1980s have, of course, been subject to investigation. We know that from the press release of the ASC, at least. That investigation has taken place under the law as it currently stands. It has been conducted under the current law and, as a result, changes in this Bill will not apply to any of those investigations or charges. No-one can pretend&mdash;I hope no-one who speaks subsequently in this debate does and I do not accuse the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) of having so pretended for one moment&mdash;that this Bill is directed at past events; this is directed at future events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient one. It is part of the presumption of innocence. A person is presumed innocent and the presumption of innocence means that a person should not be held or questioned in an effort to get him to convict himself. A person should be presumed innocent and he should be at liberty until evidence comes forward from external sources to warrant his guilt being tried in a court of law in accordance with justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondarily, the privilege against self-incrimination is a protection against overbearing investigators. If there is no protection against self-incrimination, investigators could be tempted to hold people in the belief that if they ask enough questions they are sure to get an incriminating answer sooner or later; or that, worse still, if they put enough pressure on the person, sooner or later they are sure to get a confession. The abhorrence to that kind of overbearing investigation is the same as the abhorrence of torture, which was so popular in medieval times to secure confessions. It is as a result of that abhorrence that the common law recognised the privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we recognise the privilege against self-incrimination where a person is charged with murder, rape, assault, kidnapping or hijacking. But we do not recognise it, of course, for breach of the corporations law. Currently, for the purpose of administering the corporations law, the Australian Securities Commission can require the production of documents, it can call a person in, it can require a person to take an oath, it can require a person to answer any question and there is no privilege against self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person can be called in for failure to lodge a company return, for example. In that case, in regard to the privilege against self-incrimination, a person has fewer rights than if he or she were arrested for murder or rape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law does circumscribe what can be done with the information which is gleaned upon such an investigation. The law says that the answer cannot be used as evidence in criminal proceedings or proceedings for a penalty&mdash;which I will refer to generically as criminal proceedings or quasi-criminal proceedings. That is sometimes known as use immunity. The current law also goes further. It says that information which is self-incriminatory cannot be used to gather other incriminating evidence for admission in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. That is sometimes known as derivative use immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure would be as follows: the Australian Securities Commission can require a person to come before the Commission and that person can object to answering a question on the grounds of self-incrimination. Where the answer is in fact self-incriminatory, that person has to give it. It is fully admissible in civil proceedings. It cannot be admitted in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings, nor can it be used to gather further evidence which could be admitted in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question here is whether derivative use immunity should be abolished&mdash;that is, whether the information can be used to gather other evidence which is admissible. To that, the coalition says no. The privilege against self-incrimination is an ancient principle. It is not a privilege to be given away lightly. It is a protection of the citizen from the state. When it was given away in the Australian Securities Commission Act, it was given away on certain terms. Those terms were that the statement itself could not be used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings and derivative evidence from that statement could not be used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now proposed to take away one of those safeguards, which whittles down the privilege against self-incrimination. If we pass that proposal, we give a green light to use incriminating statements to get further evidence which would be admissible and further evidence which, if obtained, would mean that the incriminating statement has led to incriminating evidence. Although the originating statement could not be used, information and evidence derived from it could be used and, in practical terms, the protection of the originating statement will be so much the less. The prosecution will be able to make out a case from the accused's mouth&mdash;not with the accused's words, but with secondary evidence obtained as a result of the accused's words. The starting point will be privileged, but the end point will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that this will make convictions easier, and no doubt in some cases it could. But so could a lot of other things. Taking away the presumption of innocence could make getting convictions easier; admitting hearsay evidence in a criminal trial could make getting convictions easier; abolishing the standard of proof of beyond reasonable doubt could make getting convictions easier. But that does not mean that we do those things. This is a question of analysing justice and balancing rights. In this case we come down in favour of the ancient rights&mdash;the rights against self-incrimination and the individual's rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal in the Bill is not the norm in countries that we like to compare ourselves with. For example, it does not apply in the United States, where there was successful prosecution of Boesky Milken and Co. That country has an absolute privilege against self-incrimination. It is protected by the fifth amendment and a doctrine far wider than derivative use immunity; it has a doctrine of transactional immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was looked at by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. It is a matter on which one can come to honest opinions both ways. I concede that. Indeed, on that Committee there were both Government and Opposition members who did come to different conclusions. I prefer the view quoted in that report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that is put at 2.3.6, where the Standing Committee `clearly considers use immunity and derivative immunity as essential complements to removal of access to privilege by legislation'. Indeed, I would like to endorse the recommendation&mdash;although the reasoning appears a bit convoluted&mdash;of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation that in this particular case there be derivative use immunity in relation to statements, although it was not enamoured of immunity in relation to the production of books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some loose talk around that current law allows an offender to walk in, produce records and then achieve an immunity from prosecution. Clearly, that is not the case under the current law. That person must be the subject of an investigation; the person must claim privilege; the person must actually produce documents which would self-incriminate; and then that person would be protected from evidence that he or she, in fact, produced the book. Under the current law, it is the fact that the book was produced which actually cannot be admitted in evidence in a criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding. It is not the book itself; it is the fact that the book has been produced. The book itself is not covered by the current statute. I agree that there should not be a privilege&mdash;which is sometimes called a use privilege&mdash;against self-incrimination on the production of the book. This Bill also proposes to abolish the use immunity on the fact that books are produced, and in that the Government has our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the Bill that does not have our support is that which proposes to abolish derivative use immunity in relation to the making of answers, statements or&mdash;which is effectively the same thing&mdash;a record of interview. Clearly and plainly, no-one would support a situation where somebody could drop books on the investigator and thereby achieve an immunity. The fact that books are produced should be able to be led in evidence in a criminal or quasi-criminal trial. Once the books themselves are led and the fact that they have been produced by the accused can be led, the books themselves can become evidence, and they are very potent evidence in the case of corporate crime because books show the money trail. Once we produce the books of a corporation or its banking records and can see where the money went&mdash;through the books, into the bank accounts and out again&mdash;we have, generally speaking, the best kind of evidence that we can get in relation to corporate crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will support the amending of the current law so that one can introduce as evidence in a criminal or quasi-criminal trial the fact that somebody produced a book.

It is that part of the Bill which clarifies what is at the moment somewhat vague in the law; that is, whether a corporation has a privilege against self-incrimination. I am not talking here about the directors or officers; I am talking about whether ABC Pty Ltd, as a corporation, can claim a privilege against self-incrimination. This Bill clarifies that and says that there is no privilege against self-incrimination for a corporate person, not an individual. We will support that. As I have already explained, the privilege against self-incrimination is an individual and personal liberty; it is there to protect individuals&mdash;natural persons. Corporations are fictional persons, if you like; they are not individuals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that the law, as it currently stands, has not been tested. So much was clear from the report of the Joint Committee. It has, therefore, not been shown that it has prevented any prosecution. The Bill takes away an ancient privilege. It gives further powers to the Australian Securities Commission, which already has more powers than police would have against an individual charged with murder, rape or other criminal charge. It will be quarantined in operation against notorious offenders. The Australian Securities Commission already has unfettered power in civil actions. It can use without restrictions self-incriminatory statements in civil actions. The Australian Securities Commission has already indicated that it intends to move increasingly towards the use of civil actions in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the long term answer to corporations law is to quarantine civil and criminal actions, even if it takes building a Chinese wall within the ASC: one part using full self-incriminatory powers to take civil actions and another part recognising the full protection of individual liberties to take the criminal actions. Such is the case in the United States, for example, where there are two bodies, the Securities Exchange Commission and the US Justice Department. In the interim, where there is one commission with alternative causes of actions with enormous powers intending to rely increasingly on civil powers as well, we are not of the view that whittling down the privilege against self-incrimination further is necessary and we will move amendments in the committee stage to make that clear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I regret that in this debate my contribution will be to suggest that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is incorrect with respect to the policy that ought to be followed by this House and, more importantly, misunderstands the impact and effect of the amendments that he proposes to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has come before us after a very long time. We have become increasingly concerned about the enforceability of the corporations law. The debate takes place in an environment where many Australians are extremely disturbed about the low level of standards which have manifested themselves in corporate management throughout this country. It is an environment where those charged with the responsibility of enforcing the corporations law have told this Parliament, through submissions to its committees on repeated occasions, that without the amendments which are being moved by the Government through this Bill, they are handicapped and have their hands tied behind their back in the duties we have given them to discharge; that is, to enforce that law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we came into this House, the Government having responded to those submissions  and following two recommendations&mdash;not by the corporate policemen but by two committees which this House established with the Senate: firstly, the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, known as the Edwards Committee, which considered this matter before the changes to the corporations law were implemented and, later, the report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities&mdash;on this specific point. Both those joint committees recommended to the Government that we move to eliminate the use immunity doctrine. But then we have the Opposition popping up, like the evil genie out of a bottle, again protecting the shonks and the sharks and being unwilling to face up to the challenge that has been set out for it by those who are responsible for corporate regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just go to the question of the law. The honourable member for Higgins says that he would facilitate books that are produced to the ABC being made part of real evidence. That is not the effect of the amendment that the honourable member has circulated. Indeed, in proposed subclause (3), he has suggested this language:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the statement, or the fact that the person has signed the record, as the case may be, nor any information, document or other thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person making the statement or signing the record, as the case may be, is admissible in evidence against the person in:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a criminal proceeding;</PARA>
<PARA>The books of a company are both documents and things. Plainly, the amendment which is to be moved by the honourable member would have precisely the opposite effect to that which he purports to support in this House. What he is doing is simply disingenuous. It is plainly a false premise to come into this House and say that he supports a particular proposition and then to move an amendment which is directly contrary to that end. He comes before us and suggests that a long tradition of civil liberties is being flouted in this regard. Let us examine that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to recent changes, the corporations law never included such a use immunity document. In fact, it was added against the recommendation of the Edwards Committee only recently. The honourable member for Higgins suggests that the United States provides a model where the Fifth Amendment prohibits steps such as this, but the United States has, as a result, had to adopt a number of measures far more intrusive into civil liberties, far less accommodating to those sorts of values that most of us in this House would wish to have in terms of the enforcement of corporations law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the system of plea bargaining&mdash;the way in which civil penalties are traded off against criminal penalties; the wire-tapping; the various other techniques that are used in intrusive investigation which we would not countenance in this country&mdash;to suggest that all has to develop because a framework of effective investigation is precluded by the sorts of barriers that are set up under the United States constitution. We do not have any such constitutionally inherited restraints and, indeed, the Opposition opposed any such constitutional amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to the most comparable country where there is a corporate law framework&mdash;the United Kingdom. Years ago the United Kingdom moved to abolish the very same alleged privilege that the honourable member for Higgins still clings to. Why did the United Kingdom do that? So that it could enforce the corporations law against the corporate shonks. The Guinness prosecution depended fundamentally on having evidence available to the prosecutors derived from compulsory examination of company directors. Did that evoke from those defenders of the common law&mdash;the judges in Great Britain&mdash;any great outcry? Would we expect that they expressed themselves in outraged terms?  Let us look at what was said by the trial judge:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those likely to be questioned under that statutory regime are those whose responsibilities under the Companies Act and at common law in relation to shareholders funds and the integrity of the market are reflected in the privileged position they have. It is not asking too much, in my judgement, to impose limits on their civil rights, as Parliament has done by an obligation to answer questions in circumstances where those answers may be used in criminal proceedings against them.</PARA>
<PARA>That even goes much further than the changes proposed by the Government. In Britain the answers themselves can be used in prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case all we are asking is whether the material that is derived from an examination&mdash;for example, the very books that the honourable member for Higgins concedes should be admissible&mdash;can be used. At present, we have the absurd situation where, in the proper discharge of its responsibilities, the ASC may have a suspicion of some irregularity. It calls before it a person charged with the management of some company or another and says to that person, `We do not know whether you have done anything that is wrong, but we suspect that there may have been some wrongdoing in your management. Could you produce the books?'. That person then says, `I claim privilege but, here, I produce the books'. Presently that is thought to preclude the use of the books in prosecutions&mdash;and not thought frivolously; it is thought on the advice of the Crown's senior advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Higgins does nothing about that point. If I can move on to a point which is crucial to this debate, we have to consider the very premise being suggested by the honourable member for Higgins&mdash;that there is some reason why it is improper to use material which is discovered by reason of an examination by the ASC. A very different framework applies in company law from that which applies in most other areas of criminal investigation. It is the kind of regime that applies in law societies throughout this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins and I are both members of the legal profession which entitles the Law Society, if it suspects any wrongdoing on our part, to call us before it and to examine us as to our alleged misconduct. If there is any material arising from that examination from which a prosecution is to be brought, that material can be used. Why is it that in professions such as the law we sanction our own loss of the right of protection against self-incrimination?  It is because we are a trusted profession, because we put the interests of the community above those of our own membership, and because people dealing with our profession have an entitlement to regard us as putting the interests of the community in front of our own. We do have a privileged position. So our internal regulation, our internal management, does not allow us to treat ourselves as if we are no different from murderers, as if we are no different from rapists or as if we are common cheats. Because of our privileged position, we subject ourselves to a regime of regulation and scrutiny above that of the ordinary citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So too is the case among people who place themselves in positions of special responsibility in the corporate world. In evidence before us a leading witness, Mr Santow, gave three reasons why in his opinion corporate crime is unlike conventional crime. He said firstly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the immediate victim, the company, is an inanimate legal fiction often controlled by the perpetrator at the time, unlike the human victim of theft. There is therefore typically no human victim with direct familiarity with the circumstance&mdash;so that the prosecution is forced to rely on the perpetrator for evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for this reason and because of the complexity of the facts documentary evidence is essential. But it is only useful if it can be identified and explained by the perpetrator and by other enquiries yielding other evidence not precluded by derivative use immunity.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued, thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">unlike ordinary theft, the accused has generally exploited the privilege of carrying on business with limited liability using the public's money, either as shareholder or creditor.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot but agree with those remarks. Mr Justice Rogers, of the commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, recently argued that the officers of a company voluntarily entered a privileged legal position which carries with it an obligation, in event of failure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to explain what happened, why it happened, what was done by the executives in carrying on the business, even if the disclosures mean that civil, or criminal, liability may be proved against the person making the disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, that is a proposition with which I have no disagreement. It seems to me this is not a circumstance dissimilar to the regulations that govern the legal profession. In entering into the profession, we voluntarily subject ourselves to a set of ethics and rules of conduct that set us apart from and beyond the ordinary citizen, who is entitled not to have anyone require of him an answer to an allegation of theft, rape or fraud. But we, as professionals who voluntarily enter the profession of law, subject ourselves to a stricter and sterner regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it not so with persons entering into the responsible positions of management of companies? Why should we not expect stricter standards from the people who are, as Mr Justice Rogers says, responsible for the management of companies which have in their hands substantial public moneys, in which people have invested their futures, or in which they have lost substantial investments&mdash;people who voluntarily gain the benefit of the very substantial advantages that incorporation provides? Why should we not expect of them also a higher and different standard?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the answer is plainly that we should. If somebody becomes a company director, in my view that person is placed in a very different circumstance from that of an ordinary citizen. The corporate structure brings with it substantial advantages, the most important of those advantages being the right of limited liability. Limited liability prevents the debts of a company being carried through to become the debts of those charged with mismanagement. Because of that, companies can go broke without personal financial damage&mdash;unless a person has given a personal guarantee&mdash;to the individuals in its management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very substantial risks of abuse if we do not have a good regime against fraud and against ill-conduct on behalf of those charged with the management of our major companies. In that regard, I agree entirely with the conclusions of the majority report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Committee argues that there is a balance in this area given the evidence of the ASC when it came before the Committee and argued that a number of investigations had been impeded, that its manner of conducting investigations was being thwarted by the present legal framework, and that change was necessary to give it the capacity to be an effective corporate regulator. The ASC was backed up by a number of very substantial witnesses from the legal profession and from the business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in my submission it is peculiar that, there having been two inquiries of this House in which both parties have been represented, both reporting majority findings in favour of provisions of the kind now being moved by the Government, the Opposition now places itself decisively on the side which will still permit evasions and legal fictions to stand in the way of effective corporate policing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed to be moved by the honourable member for Higgins place us back where we have no need to go. There is no reason why Australia should shy away from the kinds of proposals moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). They are substantially milder proposals than those which have been adopted in the United Kingdom. They are proposals which balance the interests of the community with those of individuals charged with corporate management. On this point, although a corporate manager will have the right to have his statement absolutely privileged and not able to be used in criminal prosecution, if his statement leads on to other material being found that material can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not have the absurd situation where, in the course of giving evidence or responding to a requirement for an investigation under the ASC, a person charged with corporate management raises an issue which leads investigators to documents or to some physical evidence which then cannot be produced in court because it flowed from its being found out of that examination. That is an absurdity; it leads to injustice; it leads to the law being seen as merely a matter of advantage to those in positions of high corporate responsibility; and it leads to the law being seen in a very poor light indeed. So I commend the proposals that the Attorney has presented to the House and urge that they be supported by both this House and, later, the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the third time I have made an attempt to speak on company law; I have only managed to get to two minutes on the other occasions, so I thought I would try to say a few words in the broader sense as well as on the matter at hand, the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present moment we are suffering from a sense of disappointment at the way in which company law has been administered in Australia, a sense of great disappointment at the way in which the ASC, the great white hope of Lionel Bowen and the present Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), has operated since its implementation. As a consequence of that, I am indebted to Bill Beerworth, who is a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. I will just quote from him as to the procedures by which reform or amendments come about, as seen by a practitioner but a non-member of parliament. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. A decision is made that a "reform" is necessary. The decision is often based on a report or investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. A team from the Attorney-General's Department sorts out the policy internally and obtains a draft from the Parliamentary Counsel. Usually, parts of the report are jettisoned because they do not appeal for one reason or another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. A Bill is introduced and enthusiastically recommended by the Attorney-General (or other responsible Minister). He thereby obtains a vested interest in its passage and his ego and reputation tend to be on the line.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Inevitably, an unrealistically short time is allowed for what is euphemistically called "consultation". This is usually extended if the matter at hand is completed and there is sufficient complaint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Attorney-General (or other Minister) tends to resent any criticism and redoubles his determination to push the "reform" through Parliament. Commentators and critics are dismissed as misguided, reactionary or politically motivated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. Submissions, representations are carefully acknowledged and compiled, but given short shrift.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Legislation is guillotined through Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear to a lot of that! He also goes on to make this observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know from my own experience on the Advisory Committee that there is in reality very little opportunity to comment and disagree, and disagreement was taken to be ignorance or evidence of negative attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is pretty strong stuff from a member of the Advisory Committee. It reflects, I think, pretty much on the process of reform. Something that I consistently quoted to the Government in the past when the legislation was being brought in is that there is really very little to do with reform; there is a great deal to do with centralisation, the old concept of a grab for power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the 1989-90 Bill coming in, requests for reforms or amendments were deferred. Mr Bowen objected to them. He did not want amendments at that stage; they were all put to one side. His view was that we must have the new grand design. And we got that. The amount of $8m was quite deliberately chafed off the NCSC, and $120m was put into the ASC. It has a great set-up! But we now look for results from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the ASC, Mr Hartnell, is publicly on record as saying he is disappointed that it has not got results. He got the money. He is very pleased that he has the best computer system in the world. Having got the best computer system in the world, what are we going to do with it? We are going to require proprietary companies to lodge reports half-yearly. Who are the stickybeaks and what is that all about? There is no necessity for that, except that it fits in with the total build-up of the bureaucracy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we might be able to avoid those extra costs to business and avoid that extra incursion into privacy within an area. The objects of a proprietary company are that, though generally small. They are generally of a minor nature in business. If they are above a minor nature, anybody dealing with the proprietary company who does not get a personal guarantee from those concerned has not exercised due diligence. Because of that due diligence, we are going to enforce upon the operators of these companies, presumably, the requirement that they put up an enormous amount of money to go into these areas of registration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but people outside make comments on these things. The Business Council of Australia, the great supporter of the Attorney's scheme, has now turned on him because he is not listening to it. The advisory committee which the Attorney-General set up is telling him things that he does not want to hear, so he turns off. That is what is going on in the game. He does not take any responsibility for it. Beerworth says in this document, `The consultative committee is ignored'. What does one expect?  In effect, what we forecast would happen when the new legislation was brought forward is precisely what has happened. The agenda of company law in Australia is now run from the Federal Attorney-General's Department. Canberra is a long way from Collins Street and Pitt Street and the operators of the nation. While that state of affairs persists, while the chief advisory committee is offside and while the Business Council us offside, we are going to have continuing problems. Amendments to company law are not things that have to be brought in overnight, but they have to be made with consideration, consultation and understanding of the problems at hand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good because if things have been guillotined through before there is never time to catch up. I wish to refer to what is proposed in a general sense. I think the proposals put forward here do have some merit. I have always held the view that in corporate life, if one accepts the responsibility of being a director in a corporation, one is in a special position of trust. The use of immunity has been stretched to the limit in a lot of cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of certain individuals who have acted in corporations in which the law has been taken to the line&mdash;in my view, over the line. No-one has been prepared to take those particular corporations on because of the weight of money involved or because of the reputations at hand. Some very big names are involved in what I am referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as an opposition have a constant policy of encouraging savings, and I hope that we as a nation have a policy to encourage savings, to encourage investment, to encourage private investment. To do those things we do not want to have the constant underswell in the nation outside among the ordinary investors&mdash;not just the professional investors but the ordinary investors in Australia, those referred to as the mums and dads in the press these days. They must be able to feel that people will act as their trustees in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too often, a lot of corporate directors and executive management, and those who fill both positions, act in their own interests before they act in the interests of the corporation&mdash;and therefore the individual. There are many examples of that. That has done Australia enormous harm. It does the investor enormous harm. It has really only been in recent times that some of the superannuation funds of major institutions have blown the whistle on some of the activities that have taken place. There is no doubt that some major corporations feel themselves above the interests of their minor shareholders, and therefore the minor investors have to take a role. There is no doubt that in some medium sized corporations, both industrial and mining, the tendency has been for some of the directors and/or executive directors to  regard that as a wholly personal operation. The costs involved and the use of corporate money in those companies has been handled in such a way that an attempt has been made to make it look as though that money really is the person's money rather than the corporation's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, there is a lot of merit in making those sorts of people, if they choose to pick up the benefits, wear the liabilities. The time will come when, unless governments are prepared to look at those responsibilities, either institutions or individuals will have to be prodded into it or we will run the real risk of shutting out the smaller investor, except as a punter, in the investment forums of the nation. Why should he be interested in taking a long term view of corporations if that is generally regarded as the way corporations go? He is better off down at the racetrack and getting a result on the spot rather than putting his money into a corporation where he cannot trust the people concerned. So I see some particular benefit in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also listened to the previous speaker when he spoke about the way in which people get around the Fifth Amendment in America. I am well aware of the Guinness prosecutions in Great Britain. That was a hallmark case in itself. I am also aware that here currently the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 empowers the Commissioner to disregard the question of civil liberties almost totally. He can demand evidence and books and use them. Under the Trade Practices Act, but not quite as forcibly, the same thing broadly applies in relation to corporate maters. The Queensland Wire case was one in which a lot depended on the evidence which was extracted in the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to some of the things that occurred in recent times. In the case of the Interwest investigation, when it was sought to interview Mr Avram he personally sought to be examined under section 19 of the Australian Securities Commission Act so that he could get some immunity. Therefore, the ASC backed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much the same thing happened in relation to some inquiries into Occidental Life, Regal Life and Qintex, to mention a few. On top of that we have the case of the Bond Corporation, where there was an inquiry under way but it was made known to the people concerned that, if that was to occur,  some of the witnesses were quite prepared and willing and able to arrive with car loads of boxes of documents to dump on the inquiry. As a consequence, that was regarded as not a way, and the ASC called a halt to further hearings in that particular area. That indicates to me that the processes of investigation are being impaired in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also raises, in my mind, whether the ASC ought to have a criminal as well as a civil responsibility. If we completely cut away the criminal aspect of the ASC and restrict it to civil actions, and sharpened up the act of the DPP in these areas, we might be able to proceed at a faster rate and get a far better result than we are currently getting. I think those aspects ought to be looked at as part of the changes that we are now considering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed at the moment is really only a bit part of the process rather than a complete look at the whole. There are problems when we centralise things the way we do. I recall the Rothwells problems when Lionel Bowen was Attorney-General. Day after day in Question Time I used to ask the Attorney-General why, under section 291(2), he would not investigate Rothwells. Of course, as time went by we found out. Those sorts of things do become uncomfortable when we have so much of the centralisation here; Ministers will have to answer those questions. It will not be good enough to say that a report has been furnished on a matter or that it is not our responsibility. These problems will occur in that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, a lot of the amendments that have been put forward in company law are piecemeal; they are not part of the overall picture. As a result of the way in which the Bill was introduced, we are going to have ongoing amendments that should have been dealt with in the past, that should have been thought out at the time. As a consequence, we are getting more and more black letter law that, like the Income Tax Assessment Act, will become somewhat unrelated down the trail. Further investigations will produce pressures to tighten this or to adjust that, and these amendments will create a lot more difficulties within the companies of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a lot of dissatisfaction. Outside people do not understand why we have not been able to come to grips with the relative crimes that have occurred. It may be trivial to say it, but in 1989 Victorian police figures showed that the cost of corporate fraud cases was nearly $350m, whereas ordinary crime and armed robbery was $3m. Yet we are negligent, in my view, in chasing these matters. The Government has not delivered on company law. It has been a disappointing performance. That is now acknowledged by its great supporters in this area. I hope that in the years that lie ahead, and the many amendments that lie ahead, we will see greater effort and determination put into this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. I suppose the first question someone might ask is: why is someone who practised as a public solicitor and then as a public defender for more than a decade in New South Wales rising to support a Bill that limits the privilege against self-incrimination of witnesses before investigations and hearings initiated by the Australian Securities Commission? The answer to that is fairly simple. I have a particular view when it comes to white-collar crime and I will start with the views that I expressed in my maiden speech on 11 September 1990. They ring as true today as they did then. I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1980s has been a decade of excess and wasted opportunities. We have seen the unprecedented accumulation and concentration of wealth, all in the name of free enterprise. The irresponsibility and damage caused by corporate cowboys is just now becoming apparent. The high flying entrepreneurs of the 1980s, who prospered at society's expense and proceeded to flaunt their new found wealth, have either disappeared or are in their death throes. Society does not mourn their passing but is burdened with their funeral expenses. Australia cannot afford to be taken on a roller-coaster ride with mavericks who are concerned solely with their own interests. Yet these corporate cowboys have the audacity to claim that they are working in the national interest, that their interests and the national interest are somehow one and the same. Their empty rhetoric has been exposed for what it is.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to welcome the coming into being of the Australian Securities Commission on 1 January 1991. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No longer will corporate excesses be tolerated. Australians have underestimated the cost of corporate crime to our nation. An individual who steals $20 is dealt with more severely by the legal system than is a company which has deliberately defrauded its shareholders and the Government of millions of dollars. It is obscene. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion, the legislation was flawed at the time, because it created an inequity in the legal system. Criminal justice principles should be applied equally to all kinds of offences but are inappropriate in relation to corporate crime. I am of that view for the same reason as the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities stated in its report at paragraph 4.8:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of corporate crime also distinguishes it from `ordinary' crime. The perpetrators of corporate crimes are generally exploiting the privileged position they occupy; they may be the only people with actual knowledge of the crime; there is no clear victim. . . and much of the evidence will be in the form of records kept by the perpetrators.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that protections appropriate under the general criminal law for an individual who is statistically likely to be poorer, less educated, less sophisticated and less able to obtain first-class legal representation are not indispensable in terms of the balance of interests for corporate offenders, who tend to be well educated, adept at concealing the evidence of their crimes and well versed in the relevant law, with access to the most expert legal representation. The minority report says this in relation to the balance of public interests:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a balance to be struck between the public interest in bringing law breakers to justice and the public interest in preserving the rights and liberties society affords its citizens. Where that balance is set is crucial to the sort of community we live in.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of corporate law, the balance comes down on limiting the privilege against self-incrimination, because it has been demonstrated that we have smart lawyers rolling in with their accountants, manipulating the law and, in effect, giving themselves immunity from prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) has not really been able to answer a number of questions raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), in his second reading speech on this legislation. I want to quote some of the things the Parliamentary Secretary said in his second reading speech which need to be addressed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the agencies responsible respectively for investigating and prosecuting corporate fraud, have been experiencing serious problems in bringing effective prosecutions as the `use immunity' prevents the admission of evidence of the fact that a particular person produced a particular document, and the `derivative use immunity' protects evidence gained as a result of answers to questions. . . pursuit of remedies for the protection of shareholders and creditors may prevent successful criminal prosecutions, while major suspects whose evidence could uncover other serious offences calling for wider inquiries tend to be questioned narrowly, if at all, because the derivative use immunity provisions would allow them to escape conviction and punishment.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Opposition's answer to that problem raised in the second reading speech? The Parliamentary Secretary went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also possible for persons to exploit, quite consciously, the immunity provisions by claiming that answers may tend to be self-incriminating, then making a full confession, thereby ensuring that no evidence will be admissible against them in criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>What is the Opposition's answer to that? That is the basic problem. It was interesting to listen to the speech of the honourable member for Higgins, because he would have us believe that this Bill was, in effect, changing the ground rules for the corporate crooks&mdash;the offenders&mdash;of the 1980s. Exactly the opposite is true. Unfortunately, when the Australian Securities Commission came into force on 1 January 1991, the ground rules of the 1980s were changed to the advantage of the corporate crooks. What we are seeking to do in this Bill is go back to the law as it applied during the 1980s so that they can be prosecuted under the law as it then was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we go out into the community and defend the fact that the corporate crooks of the 1980s are escaping prosecution because of legislation that came into effect on 1 January 1991? It is indefensible. For the honourable member for Higgins to suggest that because this is not retrospective legislation, the corporate cowboys and the corporate crooks of the 1980s will not be able to be prosecuted as this legislation will not apply to them is a misreading of the situation. I think he needs to check his law books and get some decent legal advice, because this Bill returns the law to its position during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions have categorically stated that they have refrained from examining some of the people who they suspect committed criminal offences in the 1980s, because of the problems associated with derivative use immunity. Once we amend this law, we will go back to the law as it applied in the 1980s, the particular individuals will be able to be examined, and the law as it then was will be applied to them. So those who are examined after the enactment of this legislation, notwithstanding that the offences occurred in the 1980s, will be able to be dealt with in a court of criminal law on the law as it then was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose it does not really surprise me that the Opposition jumps up in the Parliament today and defends its `class' mates. What we have here is a privileged position for white-collar criminals. I do not need the honourable member for Higgins coming into this place and lecturing me about white collar crime, and ordinary crime, and the consistency of it. There is no consistency. The statute books are riddled with inconsistencies that show class bias against working class people. It is a different piece of legislation that deals with someone who breaks into a house out of necessity to feed himself or his family, and the legislation that we have on the books that deals with corporate criminals who rip off shareholders and the community for millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate crooks are treated much more leniently, and derivative use legislation is a bonus to them. All a perpetrator of a serious white-collar crime from the 1980s needs to do is roll into an investigation with the Australian Securities Commission, have a smart lawyer, and set himself up to being immune from prosecution forever and a day. It is just not on. For the honourable member for Higgins to come in here and talk about overbearing investigations, and equate what the police do in police stations with what the Australian Securities Commission investigators do with white-collar criminals in the company of their lawyers is an absolute nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not get up here lightly today to support this legislation. I have given it some consideration. In my view the balance comes down in the public interest. The charade that occurred in the 1980s cannot be allowed to pass, with people being allowed to `get away with it' through legislation that was only introduced on 1 January 1991. It has far more reaching consequences than was anticipated when it went through the Parliament. It is my understanding of the situation that the legislation would be checked over time. It was not ever felt that that legislation would remain as is forever and a day. It was acknowledged that there would be weaknesses in the legislation, and this is a glaring weakness. I anticipate that other speakers will bring some of the inconsistencies of this particular piece of legislation to the attention of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do sympathise with the minority report of Senator Barney Cooney and the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) in terms of the principles that they enunciate. I say to the House and to others that we are dealing with a special case. Serious corporate fraud perpetrated by white-collar criminals is in a special category. We hear about deterrence effect. The trouble with white-collar crime is that it goes undetected for a long time. It is not like a simple break in or a robbery where we know about it within a very short time and we know that there was a victim. The victims of corporate crime may take years to come forward or years to discover the crime that took place. What we need are really special provisions in relation to it. We need to be able to say that this is a special category we are dealing with or we cannot be taken seriously. Day in and day out, when I was appearing in the criminal courts, I was told about the deterrence effect. This legislation is the greatest deterrence to white-collar criminals that this Parliament can introduce. The clear message will go out, `You can bring in your lawyers and your accountants, but you are not going to get away with it if you are discovered.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation as it stands at the moment allows white-collar criminals to set themselves up with a defence for life. We really need to look at that very carefully because we will have a situation where the main perpetrator of the crime will come in, cooperate with the Australian Securities Commission, be the informer, and then the secondary offenders and the small fish will be the ones who are picked up in the wash. That is an obscene situation. I do not need the honourable member for Higgins coming in here and lecturing me and saying that what we are doing is overturning centuries and centuries of traditions in relation to corporate offences. We are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are overturning is something that came into being on 1 January 1991 and is fatally flawed. It sets us up as a government, as a parliament, to ridicule and mockery by ordinary people in the community. It guarantees that if the corporate cowboys of the 1980s play their cards right and get the right legal advice, they will be immune from prosecution. They are laughing all the way to the bank, and all the way to their overseas holiday places. It is not a situation where all people should be treated `equally' before the law because the law is unequal. This legislation that we are seeking to amend gives white-collar criminals special privileges that do not attach to those charged with break, enter and steal, with murder, with ordinary crimes of violence or ordinary crimes against property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">White-collar criminals under this legislation have had privileged legislation that enables them to get off the hook. I am not surprised that the Opposition comes into this Parliament and opposes this particular section. It is consistent with the class of people it purports to represent. I do not have much reservation in rising to support this Bill because, on balance, I think it is the right thing to do. I think it strikes the right balance. That is what we need to sit back and have a look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can get up here and argue the civil liberties point of view and the defendant's point of view, but it would be irresponsible to do so because it is not in the broader public interest. It is just not on to take that fine, neat, eloquent little legal point because it is the community that is going to suffer. It is we who are the community's representatives who will pay in the long term. I want to send a message to the corporate crooks of the 1980s. I say to them, `We are not finished with you yet. We are going to seek you out, and if we catch you, you are going to the criminal courts. You are not just going to get a fine, and you are not going to get away with it scot-free'.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter because of my interest in the role of directors of public companies and the problem the legislature has in legislating for honesty in these matters. Obviously the question of the roles and responsibilities of directors of public companies is very complex. As the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has suggested, directors occupy a position of trust as a director of a public or private company. There was a quotation in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> which I think covered my concern. It reads `Costly law suits scare potential board directors'. My worry has been that the legalities surrounding the activities of directors of public companies would be such that those directors who act in an honest manner will be scared off from taking responsible positions in public companies because of their concern that they might be caught up in a prosecution not of their own choosing. The main thrust of the speech of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) was that all directors were corporate criminals in the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Potentially. I suggest that most company directors, both in the private and the public arena, are honest and try at most times to conduct the affairs of their companies in an honest fashion according to the law as they understand it. That is the background of my interest in the whole matter. Obviously it is a fairly complex legal argument and involves some long, traditional practices which are now being overturned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central argument has raged through the latter part of the 1980s, and continues, as to how the Australian corporate regulators should treat those directors whose conduct is known or thought to be against the law. Should they be gaoled, is a civil action the most appropriate, or should any enforcement agencies use both powers? Other speakers have raised both those issues. Is the use of so-called kangaroo courts or star chambers justified given that many others are often adversely affected by the actions of directors, or should the many responsibilities that go with both public and private company directorships be recognised by affording various protections under the law in an attempt to ensure that Australian society does not deter its most competent persons from taking an active role as directors in the execution of company affairs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House continues the ALP's long held belief&mdash;and the honourable member for Banks supported it&mdash;that the ills of society can be cured or, at worst, substantially minimised by additional regulation. The Bill removes immunities that cover a basic tenet of criminal law, the right to remain silent. Presently, under the corporations law and the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989, there are two protections available. The first concept, use immunity, prevents the admissibility of evidence that has been obtained by either oral examination or the production of virtually any business records provided that the witnesses claim that these statements or records might result in self-incrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Derivative use immunity places the onus on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an item of evidence has not been obtained as a result of information subject to use immunity; in other words, that this information is not a direct or indirect consequence of use immunity or secondary evidence. There does not seem to be much argument that use immunity should be abolished in relation to the production of documents, and I agree with the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who is at the table, and other speakers about this. It is critical to note that the Act is not retrospective and hence will largely not cover the activities of the entrepreneurs in the last decade that have been the subject of much public scrutiny. The last speaker spent most of his speech discussing those particular individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the favourite techniques of the Bond Corporation has been to have the documents tabled at an investigation by the Australian Securities Commission and then to claim the documents will tend to be self-incriminating so that the Australian Securities Commission is unable to mount a criminal prosecution linking the previously produced records with the individual concerned. The amendment to abolish immunity currently available under the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 in relation to documents would make it more difficult for prosecution to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move to abolish derivative use immunity under both the ASC and corporations laws for the spoken word demands much greater attention in my view. It must be remembered that witnesses under both the ASC Act and the corporations law are compelled to give evidence. Here we are talking about a fundamental concept of criminal law, the presumption of innocence until proof of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt is established. Ending what is an effective right to remain silent is a contentious and major step under this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the ASC and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions claim that the present law greatly restricts their ability to launch successful criminal prosecutions against company directors. I note that there is some disagreement emerging between these two bodies, with the DPP's Director, Mr Michael Rozenes, suggesting that corporate wrongdoers should not escape merely because they wore white shirts and carried expensive briefcases. By contrast, the ASC's Chairman, Mr Tony Hartnell, is of the opinion that, if the ASC is perceived as an organisation whose speciality is criminal prosecution, there is no long term future for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These comments strike at the very heart of the debate. Is it appropriate that the powers of a statutory body such as the ASC are further extended beyond what is normally applicable in criminal trials for matters such as an allegation of murder? What should be the appropriate balance between the protection of a director's rights as an individual and complying with the law? The roles of directors must be examined. Directors are responsible to shareholders and must comply with reporting and disclosure requirements laid down by both the corporations law and, in the case of listed companies, by the stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of directors is scrutinised by financial journalists, government and interest groups. Directors may be subject to criminal sanctions. Indemnification for their actions is difficult and, even where available, insurance premiums have skyrocketed, a cost which adds to the overheads incurred by most companies, and the quotation that I took from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> last Saturday indicated the movement upward of these insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be seen that directors have onerous duties, whether they be in private or public corporations. The effect of companies and securities legislation must be to ensure that markets work efficiently and ethically. But this should not be at the cost of making the most able and most talented within the Australian community reluctant to take on the stewardship and directorship of Australia's major companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the courts and the legislature have developed concepts that recognise that capital has to be efficiently organised. The protection of limited liability ensures that the whole of a person's capital is not put at risk through participation in what could be merely a passive investment. Australia should be giving some consideration to whether there are any worthwhile elements in the so-called business judgment rule operating in the United States whereby directors who make informed business decisions in the best interests of their company are protected, whether or not that judgment later is shown to have been vindicated by events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This defence to a civil action is not unlimited, with courts refusing to extend it to where there is proof of fraud surrounding the decision. It has also run into some problems in the United States where courts have failed to recognise that there are often many inherent bars that reduce actions against company directors. Having said that, the principle has some worthy elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia faces many problems in attracting foreign investment. There have been some claims that Australia is regarded as being too soft on corporate criminals and that this acts to deter foreign investment. I believe that other factors such as management of the economy are far more significant. If overseas investors do not perceive the Australian process of policy making to be delivering certainty, they may be reluctant to be long term investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to move away from the idea of black letter law&mdash;which the honourable member for Ryan alluded to&mdash;which sets out in minute detail what should and should not apply. As the Chairman of the Victorian Law Reform Commission, Mr David Kelly, recently noted, this trend has imposed great costs on the business community, but many of these laws, including those under discussion today, have not been fully tested in the courts. This literal approach seems to date from the time of Sir Garfield Barwick in the High Court, when the Income Tax Assessment Act was interpreted in a very strict way. I think we need to move away from this idea, and there is an alternative method of legal resolution available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuzzy law, which sets out in general principles the standards expected of company directors, has much to recommend it. The adoption of fuzzy law will guide courts away from technicalities and towards substance in law. The Bill before the House today, because it removes the right to remain silent in some cases, effectively imposes a strict code of conduct on a small group of individuals and therefore is moving away from what is desirable. One of the strongest arguments for not abolishing derivative use immunity in relation to the spoken word is that the ASC must not become a latter day star chamber. In its short life span the ASC has shown itself capable of monitoring some individuals' lives closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I make no judgment on the merits of the case, I note that former Elders Resources director, Mr Geoff Lord, was charged with alleged offences under the acquisition of shares code in December 1990. Over the next 14 months, prior to the charges being dropped, Mr Lord was in the media spotlight fairly constantly, to say the least. Too often if legislation is not perceived to be working there is a tendency to go in for overkill. I think some of the problems the ASC is facing could be solved by the disallowance of immunity in respect of documents, and other speakers have supported that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions regard it as vital that witnesses cooperate. The attitude of the Premier of South Australia, as expressed in a submission to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . witnesses frequently would not cooperate if their evidence was likely to be self-incriminatory . . . primary concern is that any amendments to sub-sections 597(12) and 68(3) may result in increased levels of non-cooperation. . . will only further restrict the ability of the ASC to pursue its regulatory responsibilities. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has slightly over 870,000 private and 10,000 public companies. The Securities Commission has so far commenced only 61 prosecutions after investigating some 200 matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate should really hinge on business ethics. Abolishing the derivative use immunity will not result in better ethical standards in Australian business life. This education process really has to start before and at school and in the home, but education authorities must stress to teaching staff at primary, secondary and tertiary levels that probity in personal lives has to extend to the business world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Government moves to remove the protection against self-incrimination for non-voluntary statements, it should be very careful. Although the ASC speaks of a poisoned chalice because of its supposed inability to undertake criminal prosecutions, I think that the estimated $71m allocated to the ASC enforcement activities against the extra $41m the previous year tells a slightly different story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really think the Government adjudges allegations of corporate crime to have more serious consequences than an allegation of murder and, therefore, I believe that derivative use immunity for oral statements should be continued. The law will be out of balance if by this Bill an accused murderer had the right to remain silent but then, when at a later stage he was said to be involved in a corporate scam, he lost his right when under examination by the Australian Securities Commission. Altering this currently afforded protection will not result in the entrepreneurs of the 1980s being treated any differently, as the Bill is not retrospective, nor will it serve to promote a spirit of cooperation between governmental agencies such as the ASC and the private sector that ultimately funds such agencies' activities. Business men and women must not be said to have less civil rights merely because they swap roles from Mr John Citizen to Mr John Citizen, Director of ABC Pty Ltd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992 and to support the endeavours of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in this respect as part of the ongoing reform process in corporations law to make our corporations law more relevant. In this respect, the evidence provided by the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities is important, and certainly the evidence given by the Australian Securities Commission to that Committee is important. That is, we have a process by which the ASC, having been in the field for some time, is now saying to the Government, `We believe this is a more appropriate way to go in terms of dealing with this question of use immunity and derivative use immunity'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard the Opposition on this, and I think a focus is needed in terms of the experience of corporate law reform in Australia. I say this to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) with the best of intention: when we originally began this process of removing the cooperative scheme, his colleagues were a bit reluctant to come to the party in terms of a national scheme. There really was this notion that it should be left to the States, and we ought not be dabbling in this area. I must say, to be fair, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) ultimately came to see the sense of the move towards the Australian Securities Commission, but it was a pretty slow process and there was a lot of lobbying that went on from some of the States and certainly from the State of Queensland. We ought not be surprised at some of the speeches that get made here from time to time. Those speeches were really saying, `We do not think the Commonwealth should be in this business'.  The reason why I have a particularly strong view about this, of course, is that I come from Western Australia where I am subjected to two pressures: firstly, probably a fair amount of corporate abuse of shareholders and taxpayers generally and, secondly, a very substantial lobby that was mounted by a Western Australian industry group that really said, `We don't want any part of this new move towards the ASC'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did hear evidence in Perth in 1989, probably the most hostile environment in which evidence was taken in that process. But I find when talking to the same people in Perth that they are now firm advocates of the Australian Securities Commission. In fact, one of the gentlemen who led the group and worked with one of the major law firms in Perth recently delivered a paper in which he said how happy he was with the current circumstance. That is not to say, of course, that everything we do must therefore be given the nod and said of it that there is no problem. I want to just focus on that issue because this has not been a circumstance of easy birth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an enormous misrepresentation that went on in relation to the establishment of the ASC, including the Australian company numbers matter. This was supposed to be part of an overall conspiracy. We ended up with the League of Rights involved, in fact. The attempt to bring Australia into the 1990s in terms of management of corporate law and the proper conduct of corporate law enforcement has been a process much troubled and not without a few hurdles. I am pleased to say, having gone through a lot of difficulties in this process, we are now much better placed to go into an improved area of corporate law reform. I think this element is very central. The reason I say that is that, when one looked at the particular issue that is being addressed here, the fact that evidence is taken in a hearing, there was nothing to stop some of the more prominent people&mdash;and names come to mind: Mr Bond, Mr Connell and Mr Skase&mdash;going into one of those hearings, simply dumping a lot of documents and subsequently claiming privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incidentally, I think we have some difficulty in Western Australia in relation to our own royal commission because of the spread of the hearing at the moment. I wonder what will transpire in terms of future proceedings in jurisdictions other than the royal commission. That is an issue that we as a community need to address&mdash;the interaction between the royal commission and what may be subsequent proceedings; all of which is very necessary in order to restore some public faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member made the point about there being no retrospectivity. There would not be because, fundamentally, even if we had the most shiny case, there is no way we could convince some of the luminaries in the Senate to ever see the sense of what we are trying to do. This is a fairly shiny case, but I know that we cannot convince some of the luminaries in the Senate of the sense of our position. That would be a matter fraught with some difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the Opposition has signalled its intention to move an amendment, and that concerns me because, if we are going to get ambushed in the Senate again on a bit of sensible corporate law reform, I would not be encouraged. This process is not an easy one. I heard the honourable member on this question of what people in the business community might want&mdash;black letter law versus fuzzy law. Frankly, what one finds is that there are two views put very strongly. Quite clearly, corporate practice is not determined only by corporate law. This is absolutely correct. There are many other factors that must enter the scene. The second consideration is that, if the law itself is a bit uncertain, then we do get this complaint from people: `Look, we want to know whether we are acting inside or outside the law'. It is a very cut and dried position. That is going to be an ongoing debate. There is not a Solomon's answer, frankly. I much prefer to have a situation of clearly stated black letter law accompanied by, from the point of view of the ASC, certainly practice notes which enable practitioners in the field to know how they should be operating and, secondly, a substantial attack upon business ethics where we do need to lift the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking here about a lot of innocents abroad who suddenly find themselves before a hearing of the ASC and then perhaps subsequently before a criminal proceeding. We are talking about people who in some cases set out very deliberately and very coldly to remove money from shareholders and from the public at large in a very substantial way. We are not talking about people who just stumble into something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the further retort that perhaps we ought to be wary of directors. I quote an anecdote that was given to me in Melbourne about a very prominent person receiving a phone call in which he said, `Oh, yes, yes, yes. I would be more than happy to be a director'. The conversation went on, at the end of which the person said, `Incidentally, who am I talking to?'. What that clearly indicated was that the person was quite happy to throw his name in and become a director of a company without really taking on board what he was being asked to do, et cetera. I do not give the name because it would be improper. The point is that, if one is going to be a director of a company, one is talking about something quite serious. The Attorney-General, who is at the table, knows that, when I talk in this place as I do from time to time about vicarious liability of directors of football clubs in relation to actions taken by players on the field, I am talking about matters that they also ought to be serious about. We do not want to see the Essendon Football Club being made bankrupt by the actions of some of its players on the field. But that is another debate for another day. I know the fate of the Essendon Football Club certainly does trouble the mind of the Attorney-General, as it troubles many of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We take the position that being a director is not something one ought to take lightly. Upon talking to people in Perth&mdash;many of whom are directors&mdash;I have been very impressed by the fact that, as a result of this improved attitude towards corporate law, people are now taking the business of being a director more seriously. That can only be good because in the end we will have people who will commit themselves more actively to the business of assisting in the proper outcome of company practice in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support that very strongly. We will not be advantaged by going back to that murky past which we have all just escaped from. I will give an example. Look at what happened to the Stock Exchange second board in Perth. In the end it was lucky if six companies traded out of 120 listings. Basically, it was closed down, firstly, because there was so much malpractice; secondly, because the economy generally was not functioning and capital raising was very difficult; and, thirdly, because it became a joke. Quite frankly, it became a system of allowing people to remove money from the public under some guise or other. I was quoted as saying that all people needed was a glossy brochure and a computer, and they were a high-tech company. People took money from the public and, in some circles, people were foolish enough to promote this activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope we have learned from that. I am sure this matter is before the House because well-informed people from the ASC and the Joint Committee are telling us that we really do need to make some reforms. That brings us to this question, and that is why I have spent a few moments on the background to this matter. We are talking about something quite substantial. If the Australian Securities Commission is to have a prosecutorial role, it has to be able to get evidence. If we are talking about people coming to hearings and being required to provide answers, we are usually talking about the Australian Securities Commission having formed an opinion that there is a matter worth investigating. It will not go up and down the high streets of the various cities looking for matters willy-nilly; this is a matter for very serious consideration and deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I served on the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, I was concerned that we were not giving the ASC enough power to go about its investigatory role. I know that others in the Attorney-General's Department were saying at the time that we did not want to overarm the ASC. My colleagues from the Opposition parties and my own Party were similarly concerned about that. But I guess I was more bruised than most, having seen what had happened to the capital raisings in Perth. I was very much of the view that we needed a strong ASC; not so that it could abuse its power, but so that it would be able to do its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I return to this point: when one talks about the ambit or coverage of actual prosecutions, one is talking about a minority of the total number of players in the market in Australia. I say that because we looked at the question of fundraising and the issue of prospectuses. Quite frankly, when we pruned all of that, we realised that imposing great burdens on companies such as BHP would be a waste of time because they were never going to try to defraud the public in relation to fundraising. So we had to keep a sense of balance about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard what the honourable member said about this question of balance. Basically, the ASC is saying that if this use immunity privilege is still there, it cannot really pursue the question of prosecuting corporate fraud properly. I think we have to take this decision. If we are serious about having a proper structure of corporate law and a system in which we can prosecute breaches of the law, then this notion of use immunity has to be dealt with as it is dealt with in these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will come back and talk about the common law situation. My response to that, quite immediately, is that we are not talking about the normal conduct of events in the community; we are talking about people who, by definition, are better informed and are players in the game. I use those words deliberately because, equally, one does not normally apply the law to players in other games, such as football. In that case, we do not apply the external laws so readily, because the people are particular players in the game; otherwise some of our footballers would be subject to quite serious assault charges. They are not, in the circumstances, because the benefit of the doubt is given and it is argued that they are playing within the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, we are talking about players in the game who are informed about the game. Quite frankly, one of the difficulties in terms of corporate law in Australia is that in the past some of those players have been somewhat ahead of the NCSC and the old system of corporate law enforcement. So, in my view, we have really learned a lot in terms of the way we ought to be managing corporate law and we are suggesting here that we should make this necessary reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that have troubled me immensely in looking at the Bond matters, which have been much debated around Australia, is the concern that there has been a use of money from the Bond Corporation to hinder the process of proper law enforcement. So we end up with the depleted resources of the corporation being used by the principals of that company for the purpose of simply delaying the process of law enforcement. In the end, people in the community say, `Look, what's the point?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I have noticed over time is that we have a very low level of equity holding in the Australian community. That occurs because when people venture into shares they often get their fingers burnt. We really have to be quite serious about this; if we want people in Australia to become shareholders&mdash;and I am one who strongly believes in that; I believe it improves the overall depth of the capital market and the information base of the community&mdash;we have to say, `Your money is safe in certain circumstances'. It can only be safe if there is proper corporate law in place in terms of fundraising and if there is proper corporate law enforcement in terms of breaches of the law so that people can make informed judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I think we have been behind the game so much in Australia. Certainly, in the past the Opposition put forward the argument that this was a matter for the States. I am glad that is not being raised still, because it became a tiresome old argument which was used to obstruct a whole lot of matters which ought to have been dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up this matter, I am suggesting that if we want to go ahead seriously with corporate law enforcement, we need a proper system. The ASC needs to have the capacity to conduct investigations and to use that evidence subsequently in criminal proceedings if they come to fruition. People have said to me in conversation that it would be their preference to go into a hearing and simply dump all of the documents, knowing that they cannot be used again. They are not fictitious conversations; those points have been made to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, how will the people out there feel? Will they think there are two sets of laws?  There is one set for the white-collar criminal, who can get off; but if a person happens to be caught trying to shoplift in the local delicatessen, he or she will probably receive a substantial penalty. That is the view of the community at large, and I hope the Opposition is not trying to suggest that there ought to be two systems of corporate law. I think that is the issue. Unless the ASC can proceed to prosecute, then we are really hampered. We are talking about two different classes of people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with only two other remarks.

The big difficulty is that very often cases ought to be put up, but the volume and technicality of the information may well be beyond the current processes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inappropriate evidentiary requirements in corporate offences imposed by the immunity from self-incrimination are, of course, the main focus of the changes suggested here. The nature of privilege against self-incrimination is embodied in the ancient and historic common law. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cross on Evidence</EMPHASIS> it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rule is that no one is bound to answer any question if the answer thereto would, in the opinion of the judge, have a tendency to expose the deponent to any criminal charge, penalty or [in a criminal case] forfeiture which the judge regards as reasonably likely to be preferred or sued for.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is most objectionable, Mr Deputy Speaker. In its present form the Corporations Bill allows for two forms of immunity&mdash;use immunity and derivative use immunity. A recent report by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities entitled `Use Immunity Provisions in the Corporation Law and the Australian Securities Commission Law' describes the two forms of immunity as thus:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At hearings conducted under both Laws the right to silence is removed. The legislation explicitly removes the right to answer a question or provide a document on the grounds that to do so may tend to incriminate the person so doing. However persons are then indemnified against the consequences of giving evidence by making oral evidence, and, in the case of s.68(3) of the ASC Law the signing of the record and the production of a document, inadmissible in any criminal proceedings (other than for perjury) and, in the case of s.68(3), civil proceedings for the imposition of a penalty. This is described as use immunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sections go further and indemnify the person against the use of evidence gained indirectly from "leads" provided by answers to questions or documents produced to the investigators. This is described as derivative immunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is at this point that problems occur for the regulatory organisation. The Australian Securities Commission and the DPP have both conveyed to the Joint Committee the difficulties that arise. I served on this Committee. I will quote its evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical effect of this is to place insurmountable obstacles in the way of successful criminal prosecutions. In the interests of preserving the assets of a company or otherwise minimising the loss resulting from mismanagement or fraud the ASC will seek to act quickly through civil actions in the first instance. The ASC is concerned that by using its powers to compel evidence in order to seek civil remedies it will be prevented from obtaining admissible evidence which could be used in subsequent criminal prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to maintain the integrity of the securities markets, we believe that we should retain the option to use both civil and criminal remedies and that it is inappropriate that our investigation, in order to bring forward a civil remedy, should, of necessity, jeopardise criminal prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA>If this country is to improve its status in the international market, it is important that we maintain a highly effective and competent regulatory system. Last week we discussed the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Bill 1992 which promoted such international cooperation. This Bill, along with the present amendment Bill, plays an integral role in the overall strategy to improve Australia's ability to maintain a high profile as a respected and honourable competitor which is capable of controlling and reducing the level of fraudulent activities in our markets. Our overseas counterparts have already revised their corporations law so as not to contaminate their ability to investigate and prosecute corporate offenders. As the international financial markets unify with a lowering of political and geographical boundaries, the need to create an effective regulatory body becomes paramount.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the United Kingdom, the birthplace of the common law privilege against self-incrimination, the privilege has been removed in corporation matters by the Companies Act 1985. The investigation of the most serious corporate crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the Serious Fraud Office. Interestingly, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cross on Evidence</EMPHASIS> it was stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the effect of self incrimination rules is to deprive the tribunal of relevant evidence powerful arguments are required to justify their existence, and the tendency of the modern law of evidence has been to reduce both their number and their scope.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia we need to consider the changes occurring overseas as the integrity of our own regulatory body, the ASC, needs to be maintained and not inhibited by immunity barriers. At present the Commission's important objectives&mdash;firstly, to maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of companies and of securities markets and futures markets in the interests of commercial security, reducing business costs and the efficiency and development of the economy; secondly, to maintain the confidence of investors in the securities and futures markets by ensuring adequate protection of those investors; and, thirdly, to take whatever action it can take and is necessary in order to enforce and give effect to national scheme laws&mdash;are clearly being inhibited by the present immunity regulations under the Australian Securities Commission law and the corporations law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of such a commission at this stage, as was the situation in the last case relating to the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulations Bill, are worth recalling. They are, firstly, a single substantive law for all matters governing corporate, futures and securities activities; secondly, accountability to a single Minister and Parliament; thirdly, uniformity of administration through a single administrative unit with Australia-wide coverage; and, fourthly, a uniform administrative law regime. I submit to the House that the benefits of that commission are also being hindered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission, like its international counterparts, focuses on reinstating certainty in the domestic markets and regaining confidence for this country in the international arena. Without confidence, which is a vital component, the whole strategy becomes endangered and the prospects of a regression to the policies of the 1970s impedes our future. In the Commission's own words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if we are left with s.68(3), [we] will tend to seek out very specific civil remedies where we can use the evidence which we obtain in the exercise of our power, but there will remain the fact that there is no other criminal prosecutor who will be preparing the criminal cases, and our conduct may be jeopardising those cases which should be brought before the courts</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . creates a difficultly so profound . . . that an examination of those who are suspected may have committed an offence should not take place until it is amended.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very powerful indictment of the law as it stands that was put in evidence before the Joint Committee. This perspective of the difficulties which are emerging from the constrictions of the present laws is also reflected in the public's perception of the viability and success of the ASC. The Premier of Tasmania amplified this issue when he expressed the following concerns to the Joint Committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government believes that there is a growing feeling of cynicism in the Australian community at the way in which corporate criminals are able to use their vast resources to frustrate the legal system and in many cases, avoid liability. This is exacerbated by the public's perception that the legal system is designed to assist these people in their endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA>The market crashes in the 1980s, the demise of the corporate giants and their effect on the economy and individuals form a rather distasteful depiction of the ramifications of ill-favoured financial and corporate transactions. Naturally members of the public have inauspicious perceptions of the power and potential harm of fraudulent and inefficient corporate transactions. The term `corporate cowboys' has a dubious connotation which symbolises the present perceptions of the Australian public about the high riders who disregarded the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all realise that perceptions play an important role in the confidence of an individual and a nation. If the present viewpoint expressed above is maintained, I submit that it will be increasingly difficult to muster overseas approval when internal perceptions are so sceptical. Consequently it is important for these changes to be incorporated in the legislation. However, when discussing changes to immunity, it must be emphasised that the aim is not to completely abolish this ancient privilege, but to minimise its obstructive influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments provide for the removal of the derivative use immunity available to witnesses giving evidence under compulsion in investigations under the Act and, for the witnesses who have produced a document under claim of potential self-incrimination, of the use immunity currently available in relation to the fact of that production. The proposed amendments would also deny to bodies corporate the benefit of any use or derivative use immunity proceedings under the Act, since these would be available only to natural persons. The proposed amendments are not expected to have any financial impact on government expenditure. In this situation, we would receive maximum benefit from the Commission's ability to ensure effective investigation and prosecution of corporate offences without any financial outlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this House all have an onus upon us to protect the rights of the individual. The rights of the individual must always be paramount in our society. It is the Parliament's job to protect those rights. In terms of individual rights it also needs to be remembered that individual shareholders and, indeed, groups of shareholders also have rights, as individuals and as a collective group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Committee, I had some very serious reservations about some of our recommendations that have led to this legislation and I laboured long and hard in my thought processes about them, until the last recommendation when we considered that at present we are left with the unpleasant situation where a person who has detailed information on complex transactions of an offence which has been committed or concealed may use the present immunity laws under the Corporations Act 1989 to make a full confession of the crimes for which he or she may not be prosecuted and `leads' may not be used. It cannot be contested that this does not evoke a barrier to the performance of the Commission's aims and objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect what has finally, largely met my concerns are the words on 26 February this year of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), in the second reading speech of the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill. In particular, he said that these amendments will be reviewed after five years of operation, this being in answer to the Committee's view that there should be a five-year sunset clause, the former mode of operation being preferred to the latter in terms of the crucial nature of some prosecutions and their lead-up to trial. The honourable member for Makin also gave a commitment that the operation of these new laws will be monitored and an interim review will take place after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one will be very interested to see in 12 months time what will be learnt from such a review. I am sure that the people at the ASC, and indeed the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his Department, will be continuing to monitor these changes in the law. It is important that the mechanisms of the States are charged with that responsibility and that we in this Parliament ensure that we take the time to make an overview of them as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the amendments before us today are a progressive and important step in streamlining Australia's approach towards regulating its financial sector and providing this nation with a sound basis for performing in an efficient and respected&mdash;I stress `respected'&mdash;manner in the international arena. I wish to commend these amendments to the House. I am sure that the Opposition will acknowledge the importance of these amendments for the future integrity of the ASC and the nation's financial markets in the international arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the second reading debate on the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill 1992, I am aware, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and others in the House are, that amendments are to be moved in the committee stage by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). There may be some matters arising out of that stage which I will address then, but, in closing this debate, I propose to touch on most of the matters in the foreshadowed amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those members on this side of the House&mdash;the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch)&mdash;for their support. It is interesting to consider that the honourable member for Denison, the honourable member for Stirling and the honourable member for Barton have all had considerable experience on committees dealing with corporate law matters, and the honourable member for Banks has a particular interest in all matters involving the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with what the Bill is about, because there may be some confusion. This Bill does no more and nothing less than remove the derivative use immunity which came into operation on 1 January 1991. It returns the law to the same position as existed prior to that date. The removal of the derivative use immunity was recommended by the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report of November 1991. This report was referred to by the honourable member for Barton who indicated that he had some reservations about it. That does not make him unique. We all have some reservations about these matters because it is a matter of balance. That was a matter which you, Mr Deputy Speaker, touched on in your contribution, as did the honourable member for Banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that we on this side of the House need any lectures on civil liberties from those opposite. Although the removal of the derivative use immunity was recommended by that Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in November last year, the problems it raises were foreseen much earlier by the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation. In its report back in 1989 that Select Committee concluded, although without following it through in its recommendations, that the derivative use immunity should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been canvassed tonight by speakers on both sides of the House, it is well known that both the Australian Securities Commission and the Director of Public Prosecutions say that it is preventing the effective investigation and prosecution of offences under the corporations legislation. The Government agrees that its removal is required to prevent it defeating the purpose of the national scheme laws. Put simply, that is what this Bill is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate tonight we had some contributions from the other side of the House which ranged fairly wide and just touched on this issue. There were contributions, firstly, by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and later the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). I will deal with the honourable member for Ryan first. He expressed concerns about various matters&mdash;he, of course, being a very late convert to the nationalist scheme, and almost the last of the Mohicans in his hanging on to the old, failed cooperative system which served this country so appallingly for so many years. So his contribution was not all that surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Ryan quoted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 24 March which reported a speech of Mr Beerworth, but for some reason he said that Mr Beerworth was supposedly a member of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee. If he is, it is news to me. I have not read the honourable member's speech, and I do not know whether he represented that Mr Beerworth was on the Advisory Committee, but I can assure the House that he is not and he never has been on that Committee. Nevertheless, Mr Beerworth's criticisms were trotted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to remember that Mr Beerworth was one of the most vehement critics of what we refer to as generally drafted, or in some cases fuzzy, law in the prospectus provisions of this legislation. Those provisions were drafted in general terms and the business community indicated that they could not understand them. This is somewhat relevant to the matters raised by the honourable member for Corangamite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot win with the business community on this issue. If one gives them black letter law, they say, `That is too difficult and there is too much of it' but, if one gives them general principles law&mdash;or fuzzy law as it is sometimes referred to&mdash;as happened in the case of the fundraising or the prospectus provisions, they complain again. Mr Beerworth was one of those. Of course, in looking at that prospectus provision which made people liable for misleading statements or omissions from a prospectus, he completely ignored the fact that that sort of legislation has been around since 1974. Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act has virtually the same applications as section 995. Section 995 was inserted only to make all the law clear on its face. It has been there since 1974 but then, when that provision came in, they found it very difficult to understand. I just make that point to indicate how hard it is to please that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the matters raised more substantively by the honourable member for Corangamite, I will quickly remind him about the matters which are causing such terrible problems to people in the corporate area. The first Bill we passed dealt with insider trading&mdash;a fairly insidious operation&mdash;and no-one complained about that. In fact, it was supported by the Business Council of Australia, which provided clarifying amendments which we adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Bill was on the consolidation of group accounts. After the experience of one well known company, I am aware of no-one who opposed that. The other one involved some technical amendments to the fundraising provisions, which also did not cause anyone any problems. The question of unlisted property trusts was another one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the matters raised by the honourable member for Ryan&mdash;not by the honourable member for Corangamite&mdash;when he was talking about continuous disclosure. That is merely a paper which has been put out for members of the business community to have a look at. If they want to come forward with constructive criticisms of it, that is what it is there for. They are invited to do that. We recently put out a draft exposure Bill which involves such things as loans to directors in which we are basically saying that it is not a bad idea&mdash;it is probably a good thing&mdash;if one is lending money to oneself and it is the shareholders' money, to tell the shareholders. Occasionally it might not be a bad idea if one says to them, `Do you mind?'. That is the sort of legislation which has caused everyone to become quite hyped up at the moment. All I am saying is that, if that is too great a burden to place on the directors in this country when they are not dealing with their own money, I think there is something radically wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the matters raised by the honourable member for Higgins, going more specifically to this Bill, he made the point that there is currently nothing to prevent a document that is produced by a person being used against the person. That is where I think we part ways on this matter, and that is why the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. The ASC argues that the derivative use immunity prevents the use of such documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out the normal investigation process that we are talking about here. Firstly, one does not know where the books are. That is the normal position. So normally one has to ask company officers&mdash;that is, one has to examine them&mdash;otherwise one does not know who to direct the notice to produce to. If one does not know where the books are, it is not much good asking someone who does not have them to produce them. Secondly, company officers would commonly claim privilege for virtually every answer they give at an examination. Whether they bring the books with them and produce them or just tell the ASC where the books are, there is a very strong, arguable case that the production of the books is a direct or indirect consequence of the person making a statement to the ASC. There is no doubt about that. The ASC was able to convince the Joint Committee of the strength of that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the point that the honourable member for Barton made. It was on balance but, listening to all of the information that was put forward, at the end of the day the Committee said, `Yes, what the ASC is saying is correct. We do not want to be protecting people from prosecution in these sorts of circumstances' and they in fact accepted it. That was what the Government wanted, and that is why we are moving to amend the law in the way that we are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins touched briefly&mdash;he did not make a big issue of it&mdash;on the fact that the principle against self-incrimination is not abrogated in the United States of America. It is very different in the United States; it has a very different investigating regime for a start. Although we had a bit of a dissertation on the history of civil liberties, it is worth mentioning to the honourable member for Higgins that the constitutional position in the United States is considerably different from the position here. Whenever we on this side of the House have suggested that that ought to be improved in terms of constitutional amendment, we have got a decent belting around the ears from those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the type of investigation, Boesky and Milken were two cases that were cited by the honourable member for Higgins. The success of both those prosecutions was largely due to the ability of prosecutors to use plea bargaining. The honourable member for Higgins can correctly say that that goes on here, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it does. I concede that, but not to the extent that it does in the United States. In the United States there is a tendency to have agreement for lesser charges against what I would refer to as the smaller fish if they agree to testify against the bigger fish. There is bargaining with the big fish to then plead guilty to even more serious charges. That is exactly what happened in one of the matters the honourable member for Higgins cited, the Boesky case. Again, I am not saying that because it happens there it should happen here, but it is not as if Australia is doing something very odd here. In the United Kingdom, which is a closer model as far as we are concerned in the company law sense, not only has it got rid of derivative use immunity but it has also gone to a further stage of saying that the answers can be used. We are not suggesting that. But the United Kingdom has, in fact, got to the stage, with a very similar company law structure to ours, where derivative use immunity has gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Higgins pointed out that the measure is not retrospective. That is correct; it is not. He then raised the point about what will happen with some of the corporate bandits of the 1980s as this Bill will apply only from when it is passed by the Parliament and not retrospectively. He was not suggesting that it should be, which we can see from his amendment. Nevertheless, there was no suggestion of that at any stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the offenders of the 1980s could still be dealt with under this legislation. That would depend upon whether or not they had been examined. If they are examined after the enactment of this legislation, they could well be caught by this legislation without the legislation being retrospective. In fact, one of the reasons that it may be necessary for this legislation to be passed is that it could be necessary to have successful prosecutions not only prospectively but also in relation to some of the matters of the past. That will depend on whether or not examinations have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, this matter has been examined at great length by parliamentary committees of various political persuasions. One of those committees, the most recent committee, in fact had a difference of view on it. We had on that committee Senator Michael Beahan from the Labor Party; Senator Austin Lewis from the Opposition; the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton); the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford); the honourable member for Denison, who spoke earlier in the debate tonight; the honourable member for Ryan, who also made a contribution; the honourable member for Barton; Senator Campbell; Senator Cooney; and Senator Spindler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dunkley, Senator Campbell and Senator Cooney dissented from the majority report. I can understand that difference of opinion but, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech, this matter goes back further than that&mdash;back to 1989, when a recommendation was not made but it was quite plain what the Joint Committee felt about the matter. The Government considered it at length, considered it after matters were put to it by the DPP and the ASC, and did not come to the conclusion quickly or, for that matter, easily because all of the matters raised were taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I do not need to sit here and be told about civil liberties. It is a matter which concerned me when I first examined it, but it is worth noting one short example because it sums up what we are about. Take the case of a Mr X, who gets secret information about the activities of a company which can be known as company A. That company is about to make a very profitable takeover, and Mr X informs his stockbroker, a Mr Y, and tells him to purchase 10,000 shares in company A for him and another 10,000 shares on behalf of company B, of which Mr X happens to be a director. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scene is set for a killing, of course, for Mr X and for company B. Mr Y, the stockbroker, knows that it is insider trading, but he cannot resist the easy buck and grasps the opportunity. The announcement is made, the stocks of company A rocket, Mr X and company B make a huge profit on paper, and the ASC then investigates. Mr X claims privilege under section 68 and hands over his file, which implicates himself, Mr Y, the stockbroker&mdash;the friendly stockbroker in this case&mdash;and company B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens after that? Mr Y and the stockbroker are both convicted; company B is fined; and Mr X&mdash;the Mr Big&mdash;who worked it all out, knew exactly what he was doing, walks away. Members of this Parliament and the public had better understand that he walks away because of the amendment which has been moved tonight by the Opposition. If this amendment is passed, Mr X in this case, because he claims privilege under section 58, hands over his papers to the ASC, implicates himself and others, is not convicted, and walks away. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment does not affect subsection 68(2), as proposed by the Corporations Legislation (Evidence) Amendment Bill, which allows the production of documents and evidence as to the production of documents to be admissible in criminal and quasi-criminal proceedings. The amendment goes to subsection 68(3) and preserves derivative use immunity in relation to making statements and signing records under the provisions of section 68&mdash;the basis for which I outlined in my speech on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last example from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in relation to company officer X and stockbroker Y was a very long bow indeed. After producing everything, Mr X would still be liable to full civil action. So after handing over his file, Mr X would still be liable to have that file produced as evidence in criminal proceedings and to have the fact that he produced the document admitted as evidence against him. The offence could be proved very easily without any self-incrimination at all, because all that would need to be proved is that he had information that was not reasonably available. The fact that the shares were purchased could be proved from independent sources. The offence of insider trading&mdash;a very wide offence, as the Bill is now drafted&mdash;could be made out quite easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are arguing about derivative use immunity. In the example from the Attorney-General there was no derivative evidence at all. He was saying that he hands over his file and claims privilege. He did not, in his own example, say that the handing over of that file led, directly or indirectly, to further evidence which, by reason of the preservation of derivative use immunity under our amendment, could not be admitted. In his example it was the direct material that was handed over under the section in response to the request&mdash;or whatever&mdash;that could not be admitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this Bill, even a statement made by Mr X could not be admitted. What we are arguing about here is not the statement itself, nor the document itself&mdash;which would be admissible under new section 68(2), which we agree to; we are arguing about derivative material from statements or signing records. There was no derivative material from statements or signing records in his own example. That is why I said his own example was completely false&mdash;and it was. The opportunity that was taken on a completely false basis to say that this amendment would prevent the conviction of Mr X, whereas the failure of this amendment would secure the conviction of Mr X, was completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put forward the reasons why the Opposition has moved this amendment. Our position is that the Bill should be reconsidered and the amendment should be allowed. The Attorney having indicated that he would not allow the amendment, we voted against the second reading. We now renew our request by moving this amendment and indicating that if this amendment, together with our other amendments, were passed, we would have no objection to this Bill. We support the rest of the Bill which goes to no privilege against self-incrimination for a corporate person and, as I indicated before, the fact that a person has produced documents being available as evidence&mdash;that is, the abolition of use immunity in relation to documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus Bill which covers a whole range of different amendments to different defence Acts, many of which are of a quite technical nature. What I propose to do is talk about those aspects of the legislation which I believe are of greater substance. Some of my colleagues will be taking up in this debate a range of other issues that are of concern to the coalition in the broader area of the administration of the Department of Defence and the Australian defence forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two major aspects of this Bill which I want to discuss tonight are, first of all, the provisions which repeal the National Service Act 1951 and the National Service Termination Act 1973. The decision by the Government to repeal those two Acts goes back to the controversy which surrounded the commitment of Australian troops to what became known as the Gulf war&mdash;a decision which was strongly supported by this side of the House. In retrospect, I think Australia can look back on its contribution to the Gulf war, albeit a small contribution, as one that it made with a great deal of pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a contribution that won the overwhelming support of the Australian Parliament. I am sorry to say it did not win unanimous support, largely because minor groups in this Parliament&mdash;one member of the House of Representatives and the sort of rag bag of greens and Democrats and so on in the Senate&mdash;decided for rather cynical political reasons, I would have thought, to oppose that contribution to the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the perhaps less honourable things that happened during that debate&mdash;if we could call it a debate&mdash;about the Australian involvement in the Gulf war was the emergence of a campaign by the Australian Democrats. They claimed that the Government was actually seriously contemplating introducing conscription for the purposes of providing additional resources for Australia's contribution to the Gulf war. When we actually reflect on the contribution that Australia made, it is hard to believe that anyone could have taken seriously that proposition that came from the Australian Democrats. Really, it was one of the more stupid scare campaigns that I have seen in this Parliament. It was perhaps not as stupid as some of the economic scare campaigns we are seeing at the moment as the Government desperately tries to cling to office, but all the same it was a pretty stupid scare campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has decided to do in response to that&mdash;and we do not particularly criticise it for this&mdash;is to repeal those two Acts that I referred to in order to phase back any commitment that can be made in Australia to conscription in the event of war. What this legislation does not do is preclude altogether conscription in Australia. There is no proposition that the Government is putting forward to that effect, because conscription can still be carried out under the Defence Act of 1903. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that first point, the coalition does not oppose the decision that the Government has made, and we would simply make the point that the scare campaign that was run by the Australian Democrats just about sizes them up. I do not think one needs to elaborate any longer in this country on the issue of the credibility of a political party&mdash;if we could call that rabble a political party&mdash;such as the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel would feel very strongly about that, because he himself was saved from a vicious assault by ex-Senator Janine Haines at the last election by, I think one would say guardedly, the common-sense of the electors of Kingston. Their commonsense does not extend to enough of them voting Liberal, but they have some commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of this legislation that I want to refer to is that it revises part IV of the Defence Act, under which conscription can take place. It addresses the issue of conscientious objection to conscription, which is obviously a very important issue. One aspect of this part of the legislation is that the Government proposes in this Bill that any proclamation that there should be conscription requires the prior approval of the Parliament of Australia. That is a proposition that we on this side of the House are happy to support. Section 60(1) of the Defence Act provides that conscription can only take place when Australia is under attack, or is subject to an invasion of a broader sort. What the Government does in this Bill is amend that section to ensure that there is provision for prior parliamentary approval to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather curiously, the Government proposes in this amendment that that prior parliamentary approval should be given at least 90 days before the proclamation comes into effect. The coalition will be moving four different amendments during the committee stage, which I assume will now take place tomorrow. I will come back to our reasons for moving an amendment in relation to that 90-day rule because, although it is not particularly the most offensive thing that any Government has ever put forward in this Parliament, it seems to us to be a superfluous provision added into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment to the Defence Act effectively gives the Parliament a power of veto over the Executive on the whole exercise of conscription. As I said earlier, we regard that as appropriate for a range of reasons. First, consistent with the commitment we all have to democratic processes, when a major decision of that kind&mdash;really a decision which would be, to say the least, a very controversial decision&mdash;is made by the Executive on behalf of all the people of Australia, it is only appropriate that the pinnacle of this country's democracy, its Parliament, should give approval to that decision. Secondly, looking at it from another side, if a government were to proceed with conscription without the broader support of the Australian community and, in particular, without the support of one of the two major political movements in this country, I submit that that would be little short of a political disaster and might even invite military disaster as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a circumstance where Australia were subject to attack or invasion and there were a need for conscription, it is hard to believe that in such dire circumstances the Australian people would rise up against it or one of the major political parties would oppose it. I find it hard to believe that that would happen. Nevertheless, there have been times in our history when conscription has been not exclusively a party political debate but a major political debate. The best example of that without doubt were the conscription debates of the First World War. There is no doubt that those debates and the two referendums that were associated with them were a debilitating exercise for a country which was in the midst of making its own contribution to a truly ghastly war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, what this legislation proposes makes a great deal of sense in that, if conscription were to take place, it would take place only with the approval of the Parliament and, in reality, by a virtual consensus of the Parliament.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt for a minute that, if a Labor government&mdash;if there ever is to be another Labor government&mdash;were to decide that conscription was necessary at a time when Australia was under attack or invasion, in those circumstances there would be a fairly strong degree of support from this side of the House. I have to say that I am not so sure what would happen if the situation were the other way around. But I have to make the point that, if in those circumstances a coalition government wanted to introduce conscription in order to help with the defence of our country, and the other side of politics decided to go out in the community and oppose that strongly, it would make it very hard for us to proceed with that conscription, because we would divide the country well before we achieved our military objectives. Of course, that is the last thing we would want in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have argued against this particular provision on the grounds that it would take too long for a government to make a decision on conscription because one would have to call the Parliament together, conduct a parliamentary debate and so on, and also that it weakens the flexibility of the Executive to make these types of decisions in the midst of a military contingency. But I have to say that it would take quite some time for the call-up to take place, for the troops to be trained effectively; therefore, I think the argument about the length of time is probably a fairly superfluous argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we do believe that this proposition&mdash;which does not seem to me to have any foundation in commonsense&mdash;that there should be a 90-day provision in relation to parliamentary approval, really does not bear any relevance to the exercise; the legislation would be considerably neater if that were to be excluded from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of this revision of part IV of the Defence Act is that this Bill repeals the discriminatory aspects of conscription. Honourable members may almost be amused to hear that the Act limits conscription to males&mdash;that is pretty discriminatory&mdash;and to British citizens, excluding Aboriginal Australians. Quite rightly, the Government has decided to tidy up the Act by bringing it into line with the 1990s rather than 1903 when the Act was first introduced. The Government has repealed those particular discriminatory provisions and provided for conscription to apply to a resident of six months standing aged between 18 years and 60. I still have 20 years to go before I am free of the dangers of conscription myself, although I think the contribution I would make to the national defence as a soldier would be somewhat arguable judging by my performance in the cadets when I was at school. Maybe one does not have to have one's kit clean in war, and that would be my one advantage if that were not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of this change to part IV of the Defence Act is the issue of conscientious objection. Here the Government is tightening up the provisions for conscientious objection. The Bill defines more clearly the term `conscientious belief'. It establishes the right for a person to claim exemption from compulsory service in a particular war or warlike situation, and I will come back to that. It clarifies the distinction between exemption for service in the ADF and exemptions from duties of a combatant nature. It establishes new tribunals to determine claims of conscientious objection; it provides guidelines for the operation of these tribunals; and it provides for an appeal mechanism through the appropriate legal system. At the moment section 61(2) of the Defence Act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of this section, a conscientious belief is a conscientious belief whether the ground of the belief is or is not of a religious character and whether the belief is or is not part of the doctrines of a religion.</PARA>
<PARA>The Act does not endeavour to define the meaning of conscientious belief beyond that, so this Bill gives greater definitional clarity to the term by repealing section 61(2) and adding instead:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person is taken to have a conscientious belief in relation to a matter if the person's belief in respect of that matter;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) involves a fundamental conviction of what is morally right and morally wrong whether or not based on religious considerations;and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) is so compelling in character for that person that he or she is duty bound to espouse it; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) is likely to be of a long standing nature.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition welcomes and is happy to accept those particular aspects of this Bill, but with the one exception&mdash;the decision by the Government to include in this legislation a provision for conscientious objection in the case of a particular war or warlike situation. To be frank, we really do regard that proposition as one which is unacceptable. I refer to a submission that was made in 1985 to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the issue of conscientious objection, in which the Returned Services League of Australia made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that we have difficulty with is that an individual might make a distinction between one war, one conflict, one action and another on whatever grounds. We believe that the cases for discrimination between one war and another would most likely be of a political nature.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole debate about whether one can be a conscientious objector to a particular war is really a debate that revolves around whether one feels that such a so-called conscientious objection can be an objection only of a political nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view on this side of the House is that, effectively, that is true. On that particular point we certainly agree with the proposition put forward by the RSL. We will be moving in the committee stage some amendments to have that particular reference left out. Our view is this: if one is a conscientious objector, one is a conscientious objector to war. There are provisions which the Government has quite rightly tightened up to establish whether somebody is a conscientious objector. But on what basis could people object conscientiously in the case of a particular war? Surely it could be only on a political basis; surely only on the basis that they believe that loyalty to our country, nationalism&mdash;which has become a bit of a vogue word in Australia; it was a vogue word in Germany and Italy in the 1930s, but it has become a vogue word in Australia in the 1990s&mdash;in its truer and more fundamental sense, is something that applies only partially in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not think that is appropriate. We do not think people can say that, if a particular country decides to invade Australia, they object on some so-called religious ground; they are of the same religious conviction as the invading force but do not have a broader objection to the whole idea of fighting to defend their country; or they decide that the country that is invading Australia and for which conscription is required to defend their country is not such a bad country after all, and what other objections could people have. It seems to me, in truth, that the objections we are going to have are really more likely than anything else to be of a so-called religious nature, that is, that they have religious affinity with the invading force. History shows that just because we are of the same religious conviction as somebody else does not mean we will not go to war against them. It is hard to imagine any particular creed in the world which has not involved two peoples or two countries of that same creed going to war with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is that at the end of the day this is a test of loyalty to Australia, that Australian citizens' fundamental loyalty in terms of the issue of nationality should not be a compromised loyalty, that it should not be something that is expendable in certain particular circumstances that arouse certain emotional or religious feelings in those people. We will not support that particular provision of this legislation, and I will talk more about that during the committee stage of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one other point in relation to that issue: if we were to include that provision in this legislation, if we were to be in such an unfortunate circumstance that we needed conscription to defend Australia but we enabled people to opt out on the basis of the particularity of that invasion or the nature of the country invading Australia, all we would get is an absolute flood of people claiming to be exempted from conscription on presumably all sorts of fairly spurious grounds. It is either a conscientious belief&mdash;that is, a belief against the whole issue of conscription and war&mdash;or they do not have that belief at all. It is one or the other. It should not be a test of loyalty to Australia, which is curiously what the Government in this amendment is making it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make one final point in this debate which is relevant to the Bill but is of a much broader nature. It concerns the discussion that has been taking place in defence circles over the last few months about the coalition's Fightback program. I make the point and hope the Minister will take it on board: we do not want the Department of Defence or the Australian Defence Force in any way whatsoever to be politicised. Indeed, I think we would all agree in this Parliament that it is extremely important that the Department of Defence or the Australian Defence Force never be politicised, for a whole range of different reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been circulating within the Department of Defence&mdash;not all of the Department but some of it&mdash;is something which is described as a defence economic brief, dated 19 February 1992. What this defence economic brief does in one short but not very sweet section under the heading `Goods and Services Tax' is make the claim that the GST proposed in the coalition's Fightback package would be levied at 15 per cent and charged on the supply of goods and services in Australia and on the importation of goods into Australia; in essence, it is a value added tax where the full brunt of the tax falls on the final consumer of goods and services. There is no problem with that; the document seems to have grasped that detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document goes on to say&mdash;and I must say this is outrageous&mdash;that the possible impact on defence could be considerable. Oh really! Could it be? If exemptions were not provided, the impact on defence based on the 1990-91 outlay could be in the order of $740m. That is what is said in the defence economic brief, dated 19 February and circulated in some parts of the Department. This is ambiguous indeed because it says `if exemptions were not provided' and then it refers to the $740m figure which the Minister and others are doing their very best to continue to promote.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> document say? It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public sector is taxable if the goods or services are provided in the course of commercial activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence basically is not commercial activity. There are aspects of it that are, and I will come back to that, but basically it is not a commercial activity. Goods and services are zero rated. I think the authors of that document would know what `zero rated' means. I know the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) know what it means. They are zero rated if they comprise a regulatory activity or are of a non-commercial nature. Section 5.4.3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document lists as examples government services such as defence and law and order. What we actually say is that defence will be zero rated but not defence industries, because the interesting thing about defence industries is that the Government's own figures produced by the Treasury in its attack, so-called, on the Fightback program show that defence industries would be a massive $90m better off as a result of the introduction of the Fightback program; $34m better off as a result of the abolition of the payroll tax; $33m better off as a result of the abolition of excise; and $45m better off as a result of the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to offer a few comments about the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. It seeks to do a number of things: revise provisions concerning conscription and conscientious objection; enable the appointment of Assistant Chief of the Defence Force (Personnel) to the Defence Housing Authority; tidy up legislation providing for defence retirement benefits and home loan assistance schemes; and repeal obsolete retirement benefit provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) pointed out, conscription has been a controversial issue in Australia&mdash;particularly for us on the Labor side. It has been said that in this Bill we are liberalising, if you like, the provisions for conscientious objection to which the honourable member for Mayo has raised some fundamental objections. I would like to place the debate in the context of past experience. For example, during the Vietnam conflict&mdash;which I think most would agree was the most recent controversial example of the defence forces being sent overseas, with conscription a major issue within the community&mdash;only 0.13 per cent of eligible males actually exercised their democratic right to lodge conscientious objections. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may think that I have made an error, so I repeat that the figure was 0.13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was that that conflict took place in Vietnam&mdash;it was external to Australia&mdash;and it was a conflict about which the community was very deeply divided. If that is the case in terms of an external conflict, we have to try to come to some assessment as to its likely impact if we are talking about conscription in relation to defending mainland Australia. I should also place on record the views of many of those conscientious objectors about the Vietnam conflict. They said that, if it had been a question of defending Australia, they would have had no hesitation. So I certainly commend the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter we ought to take into account when we are considering this legislation concerns the likely scenarios in terms of Australia's need to respond to credible threats. Whilst people are rather overjoyed at the outbreak of peace, or the demise of European communism, and the prospects for world peace, it is true that this may add some pressure in terms of regional conflicts. But, no matter which way we look at those conflicts, it is hard to paint a picture of a real threat to mainland Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the defence of Australia, manpower is an extraordinarily important issue. I suppose the other issue is that of munitions, which is also very relevant. It is particularly relevant in terms of the ADI site at St Marys. I wish to quote some comments of the Premier of New South Wales about the ADI site at St Marys. On 26 October 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADI site provides a unique opportunity to put in place model infrastructure which encourages a composite and environmentally sustainable approach to new urban developments in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>In the spirit of true bipartisanship, I acknowledge the wisdom of those words. Sadly, the Premier seems to have changed his mind rather dramatically. Whilst I will not read onto the record some of his more recent comments, I think it is fair to say that he has done a total backflip based on the decision to set up a munitions factory in Benalla in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, has already placed on record the fact that this was a unanimous decision by a completely independent board. In fact, the chairman of that board, Russell Fynmore, made that observation in a letter to the Premier. It is rather disappointing that we have these comments by the Premier of New South Wales. Not only did he see it as model infrastructure&mdash;and I say this with some feeling because it is in my electorate&mdash;but also there was, on normal planning guidelines, the potential for the generation of 8,000 jobs associated with the industrial land that will be accommodated on that site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks about the ADI site by saying that I welcome the observation of the honourable member for Mayo, who said that we ought to have a bipartisan approach to defence. I agree with that. I also agree with the sentiment that we ought to check some of the disappointment that we might understandably feel when, in a fair game, we lose the decision for our State. ADI has five other locations in New South Wales and some 3,000 employees. Indeed, as the Minister hints in his response, it is even contemplating establishing its corporate headquarters in New South Wales. As far as New South Wales is concerned, we have lots of opportunity to work with it&mdash;particularly in terms of developing the Newington site which the State Government is very keen on for its Olympic bid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman) who, as chairman of an advisory committee on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS>, this morning brought before the Government the proposal of his committee, the colleges of TAFE, the University of Western Sydney and the schools to establish HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> as a unique educational precinct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things&mdash;whether it is ADI at St Marys, land for the Olympic bid at Newington, or establishing a unique educational precinct in the electorate of Greenway on the site of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS>&mdash;need commonsense from all sides and, most importantly, cooperation. The Premier is now trying to suggest the contamination that was always at the site and nuclear waste are reasons why he has done this backflip.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS> That was known when he made his first statement; it is certainly known now, and we are addressing those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence. With regard to the Bill, I support the proposals which the Minister has brought to the House. We have made some sensible changes to tidy up some anomalies. In terms of conscientious objection, let us look at the record and try to see how many people we may be looking at. In the most recent worst case scenario&mdash;the Vietnam war, which was external to Australia&mdash;we were talking about 0.13 per cent. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill tonight I follow on the heels of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who has represented the Opposition's views on this matter in his usual articulate fashion. I will comment briefly on the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Chifley and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price), who preceded me. He made the oft quoted call that comes from the Government at various times that there should be a bipartisan policy on defence. This is something that we would all agree with in a perfect world. We would all say that there ought to be bipartisanship on important matters such as defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, whenever there is a call for a bipartisan approach on Government matters, it usually comes at a time when the Government is in deep trouble and is looking to the Opposition to be very magnanimous and to look at the broader concerns of the community, whilst in the next breath it is being parochial and political on some other issue and bagging us about the head. Whenever we hear the words `Let's be bipartisan', we are always extremely cautious because we often have good grounds to believe that the Government is trying to wriggle out of the difficult position in which it finds itself in the hope that we will give it an excuse to get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate tonight has been interesting. As one would expect, the previous speakers have stuck strictly to the legislation. I intend to stick strictly to the legislation, as has my predecessor, the honourable member for Chifley, this evening. Therefore, I will talk about a number of very important issues which feed off the subject of change in the legislation tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of the legislation deals with conscription and the way in which the Government proposes to amend certain legislation about conscription. Conscription is an issue which is very firmly etched in my memory. As a young person in my teenage years during the Vietnam war days, conscription was a subject of intense discussion. I was first aware of it at a tender age, in my early teen years. It was a subject that just would not go away. It was a subject where one could find no definitive argument, either right or wrong. It was an argument that one eventually fell back on based on emotional beliefs rather than on logical or other beliefs. Any changes to conscription are often fraught with emotional argument and emotional concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscription is about compelling people to do things that they would not ordinarily want to do, such as having to take up arms to defend their country in circumstances that will put their own lives at risk. It is an issue that we have to treat very seriously in this House and the Opposition treats the matter in that light. This legislation enters the Parliament at a time when we are discussing Australia's involvement in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this week&mdash;I think on Wednesday&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) proposes to bring down a statement outlining in some detail our involvement in the Cambodian United Nations peacekeeping forces. This is an important debate for us because it will see Australia re-entering the Asian area with its troops on the ground. We have not done this since the Vietnam war days. For that reason we need to be very careful about Australia's involvement in Cambodia. We hope that our involvement will be only what it is currently outlined to be; that there will be no further increase in our role in Cambodia; and that the circumstances in which we find ourselves in a year's time, or however long it may be, will not turn out to be vastly different from what we expect them to be today. We do not want to see Australian troops become involved in an arms conflict in Cambodia where their lives are being more than just threatened as members of a peacekeeping force and where they may become involved in substantial military activity. We do not want them to be in that situation. I think all of us would be prepared to accept that we have a responsibility as members of the international community to participate in peacekeeping forces around the world, particularly those in our region. We have to be extraordinarily careful that we do not get into the Vietnam-like circumstances that we were once in over this issue in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Vietnam days conscription was the subject of a great deal of protest and a great deal of disunity within the Parliament. Part of the reason for that was due to the fact that there was not a consensus within the Parliament for conscription to be enforced. In this legislation we are trying to ensure that there is a consensus within the Parliament before conscription is enforced in Australia&mdash;if those circumstances where conscription is required ever occur again. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the legislation have merit. Before a government commits itself to conscription, I think all of us who believe in a parliamentary system and a democracy would want to see the Australian Parliament debate the matter and have a consensus view on it so that if conscription is required it is enacted with the full consent, the majority view, of both Houses of the Parliament. This legislation is designed to achieve that. It is on those grounds that the Opposition bases the bulk of its support on the Bill before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other matters which concern us have been outlined by the honourable member for Mayo. They relate to conscientious objection, which is an issue that no doubt occurs whenever conscription is enforced. There are legitimate reasons for people to be conscientious objectors in times of conscription. However, we believe that the way the Government is setting up these particular amendments will lead to tremendous divisions within our community and tremendous problems for us in the future. We take the view that it is fair enough for a person to have a conscientious objection against war. When our country is at threat, though, there is an opportunity for these people to have a conscientious objection to being involved in a war, even if it is war that puts at risk the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do not believe it is fair or right for people to have objections to some wars, but not to all wars. In other words, if a person says, `I am happy to go to war as a member of the Australian military forces if we are going to fight these people, but I am not prepared to go to war as a member of the Australian military forces if we are going to go and fight these people', that creates tremendous internal division within Australia. With the amount of migration Australia has, this could open up divisions on race and religion in the future. Certain Australians who are called up may not be prepared to participate because they may be required to be involved in some sort of military activity against their former countrymen or members of their own religion. We believe that this type of division could occur as a result of the Government's legislation. For that reason we will be moving amendments to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about Australia's military forces, it is important for us to realise that conscription is not an excuse for inadequate military forces in times of peace. I think the best military force that Australia can hope to have is a full time, professional, volunteer military force. There is no doubt at all that this is the best way to go if we have to defend our country. The experiences we saw recently in the Gulf crisis where the American forces and those of the allied nations were teamed up against Iraq in Kuwait, proved that all the people who participated in the Gulf crisis on our side of the fence were much more effective than the conscripts who made up the bulk of the Iraqi forces involved in the dispute in Kuwait. It shows us that the best type of defence for a country is a full time, professional, well-equipped, well-resourced, well-trained volunteer defence force. We must keep this in mind when we talk about issues such as conscription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to see, though, that over the last few years under this Government our full time, professional defence forces have been reduced in their number, and that leads us to a great deal of concern. Last year the Government proposed to reduce the size of our professional military forces. Off the top of my head, the Army, for example, has been reduced by about two battalions. It is down from six battalions to four battalions. Once again, if my memory serves me right, during the Vietnam war days I think we had 12 battalions involved in the Australian Army, and now we are down to four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are reducing the size of our Australian defence forces. Whilst I know that when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is sitting at the table, gets up to speak later he will put forward the view that the establishment of the Ready Reserve is more than enough to overcome the reduction in the full time standing Army, I believe, and many others would also join with me in that belief, that that is an inadequate response to reducing our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk of conscription, we must always remember that it is essential to have that full time volunteer force ready at any time to service Australia. The track record of this Government in its management of our military forces is not one to be proud of. The former Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in his time in charge of our defence forces was involved in the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities which was to hail a new era in Australia's defence forces. Unfortunately, that Dibb report has been basically sabotaged by this Government's approach to the funding of our military forces. I know that the Minister is going to take a point of order, so in order to avoid&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will support this legislation, subject to acceptance of the amendments that we propose. We believe that those amendments are very important indeed for the proper and successful implementation of this Bill. We do not believe in allowing people to be conscientious objectors based not solely on their support, or lack of support, for their involvement in a war, but on a lack of support for a particular type of war&mdash;be it, as I said before, for racial reasons, religious reasons or even political reasons. For example, I could be a dyed in the wool socialist and Australia could be involved in a battle with another socialist run country so I, therefore, could choose not to defend my country simply because we were in the process of fighting a comrade socialist country. That is not sufficient reason in our book for a conscious objection. It is our belief that people should be prepared to defend our country against all comers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is, indeed, an important debate. In fact, from my perspective, any time that we talk about defence in this Parliament is important. To the extent that tonight we are dealing with legislation that impacts to some degree on that very controversial topic of conscription, I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution as one of the very few conscriptees in this Parliament. In fact, I think there are only two who were victims of the system that existed post-1964. I am reminded, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you were a victim of one of the earlier systems of conscription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make my remarks mainly on the subject of conscription/national service. To do so, I want to review and put into context the historical background to conscription as we see it today. Current thinking about conscription is inevitably coloured by our most recent experience of it: the national service scheme which became law on 24 November 1964. That was a selective conscription for two years full time service, set against the backdrop of the war which was going on at that time in South Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, however, conscription has been an important issue in Australia since Federation.  Since then it has divided Australians. One of the main objects of Federation was the provision of an adequate defence for the continent. The Constitution conferred power over defence to the Commonwealth, and the Defence Act, amendments to which we are, in part, dealing with tonight, was amongst the first pieces of legislation considered in the new Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Bill was first introduced in 1901. It provided for compulsory military service in time of war. It was strongly supported by one William Morris Hughes;  however, at the time he was almost alone in the Labour Party in his support for that particular proposal. The debate raged for some few years until 1903 when the Defence Act was passed, providing that the Commonwealth could compel men to fight for their country in times of war, but only at home and not overseas. Alfred Deakin's Government introduced a Bill in 1909 for compulsory training in Australia, which went through with little opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent many hours reading the debates that have ensued on that subject of conscription over the years.  It is interesting to read what Billy Hughes said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know of no better method&mdash;I know of none half as good&mdash;of toning up physically and morally, and even industrially, the people of this nation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was speaking of conscription&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . men speak of war and peace as if war were the greatest curse that afflicted humanity, and peace a thing that could be had for the asking. Men who cry peace when there is no peace are enemies of peace. There is but one way by which any man or nation can get peace, and that is by being ready for war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Billy Hughes said those words. When he said those words in 1906, I do not think he realised the significance of what he had said. In my view, those words are as true today as they were then. There was considerable resistance to the Deakin scheme. At one stage, some 5,732 young men were imprisoned for failure to comply with the regulations that existed at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia was not ready for war when it broke out in 1914, it had a divided army. As the war went on Australia suffered enormous casualties in Europe; 28,000 Australians were killed or wounded in Europe in 1916. So pressure was put on the Australian Government by the British Government to provide replacements and reinforcements for our troops who were being so severely affected by the war in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hughes, now Prime Minister, pressed for immediate conscription for overseas service. He was rebuffed on two occasions as he went to referendums. They were close results; but he could not get the support of his Labour colleagues. He went to the people and the people, in both referendums, refused to give him the right to conscript for overseas service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compulsory training ended on the election of the Scullin Government in 1929. This Government lasted until 1931 when Lyons, another Labour renegade, came to office under the banner of the United Australia Party. Frank Brennan, who had been Labour Attorney-General previously, criticised expenditure on defence in 1936 with the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot find anywhere any person outside of our mental institutions who is prepared to say that any nation is threatening Australia with invasion.</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time he described Japan as `a little friendly nation'. Once again, because of the many sentiments that were expressed commonly in the Labour Party at the time, we were ill-prepared for the outbreak of war in 1939. As in 1914, we had a divided army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Menzies, the Prime Minister at the time, reintroduced conscription for service within Australia. This was later extended to service beyond Australian territories. Shortly afterwards when the Labour Party came to government, it attempted to amend the Defence Act by setting geographic limits to the areas where conscripts could serve. On the eve of the German invasion of Russia, Curtin declared that the Labour Party was `irrevocably opposed' to the Menzies proposal to conscript for overseas service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soon Curtin was to become Prime Minister. When he became Prime Minister he faced some entrenched opposition to conscription for overseas service. The names of Calwell and Ward feature prominently in the debates at the time as they clearly, in my view, attempted to undermine the war effort. Calwell, Ward and others of their ilk were more concerned about the class war in Australia than they were about the world war that was going on around them at the time. To them, clearly in the debates, conscription of wealth was more important than conscription of men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Curtin consequently was faced with a split in the Labour Party, exactly as Billy Hughes had faced in 1916. On 24 November, the newspapers ran headlines like `Federal crisis on conscription. Labor Party may split'. Curtin, to his credit, went as far as he could, constrained by the radicals in his Party. Conscripts were not to be sent north of the equator. In other words, we had the rather unusual situation where a conscript might die fighting in Portuguese Timor but not in British Borneo. Australia, incidentally, required the Americans to defend Darwin while we were not prepared to fight for the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debates at the time were invariably heated. There was great emotion on both sides. One is quite moved when reading some of the debates. For instance, G.J. Rankin, a UAP member and a former Major-General, in one of the debates said of a Labour member, J.S. Roseven:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Japanese landed at Newcastle the honourable member would grab the fastest car he could find and would make off in their direction as fast he could to offer himself as a quisling.</PARA>
<PARA>National service was introduced by the Menzies Government in 1949. Until 1957 this was a universal scheme for a limited time involving all three services. It was abolished completely in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in almost every year between 1945 and 1959 there was very strong support in the community for a national service of some sort. Community support rated as high as 88 per cent of the population and never dropped below 69 per cent in any of the polling that I could find. So there was very strong support for a form of national service at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1964, to get back to where I started, Mr Menzies announced the two-year selective scheme, with which most of us in this place are most familiar. The 1966 election was one of a number that were fought on the issue of conscription. The 1966 election was between Prime Minister Holt and Leader of the Opposition Calwell. Mr Calwell promised, and in his policy speech he made great flourishing remarks&mdash;as best he could I suppose&mdash;to abolish national service and bring the conscripts home. He lost the election on that issue and others, again. Of course, he is famous for having lost numerous elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having put that little bit of history in my remarks tonight, I want to put in context not only my thinking but also the thinking of many Australian people on this legislation which makes some fundamental changes to the Defence Act. I ask: what does this experience, and particularly the experience in Australia with the issue of conscription between 1901 and 1972, tell us in 1992?  More than anything else, and I do not say this lightly because I have read the information, it points to the deficiencies the Labor Party has consistently shown in its handling of defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again, it was dominated, has been dominated and maybe is dominated&mdash;I will not go that far in deference to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table&mdash;by radical left wingers. Even when it had leaders&mdash;and it did have leaders&mdash;who were prepared to make decisions in the best interests of the country, the Labor Party failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) said&mdash;and I am rather suspicious of exactly what he meant by this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's view continues to be that conscription could&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word `could'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">be justified when Australia is directly threatened.</PARA>
<PARA>What does `could' mean? How do we interpret `directly threatened' because that is the important phrase? What does it mean? How does one interpret the direct threatening of Australia? How close does that threat have to be geographically? To what extent are we talking about a threat to Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism that the Government proposes is fraught with difficulties, in my view. Imagine a parliament where the Australian Democrats have a significant influence if they represent the sorts of positions they appear to have today in respect of defence and a number of other issues. I would be aghast at the prospect of having a House of Representatives with a significant number of Independents; certainly, Independents with the sorts of views that I have heard the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) expressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Gulf war highlighted and continues to highlight the major deficiencies in Australia's defence preparedness and capabilities. We were clearly not prepared to react other than superficially in the Gulf war. I do not think anybody denies that. We now have a new three-Army policy. We should have learnt a lesson from 1914 and 1939. From my reading of it, from every perspective we had a problem with a divided Army. There were constant problems in having two armies; not only military problems but also social problems. But now we have three armies in Australia. I do not know how it is all going to hang together. </PARA>

The facts there were, of course, that despite an intense war in Europe and the Middle East Britain still managed to provide larger forces in Malaya than Australia did. Many of our British cousins suffered as our Australian soldiers did as POWs. The British worked alongside Australians on the Burma Railway, and they also died there in their thousands. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to conscription: if the Government really wants to do something for the young people of Australia whom it has hurt so badly, it should seriously contemplate reintroducing national service. I have had personal experience with that. If we are talking about conscription, then why not seriously contemplate, rather than gearing it down, in effect, actually gearing it up? Currently 30 per cent of young Australians are unemployed. I believe that there would be very good reasons why it would be better for young people to be conscripted than languishing on the dole. I think that there should at this time be a serious investigation of a number of options in respect of conscription. I am not frightened to talk about it in this place at all. It seems to me that it is the sort of subject that people want to run a mile from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are options other than direct military service, although I would say that that has a lot to commend it. There is an Army auxiliary corps, a peace corps-type alternative or a civilian national service corps for employment on national projects. Perhaps it is time to seriously contemplate the conscription of all 18- to 25-year-olds who have been unemployed for a certain period. Besides providing motivation to gain employment, it would provide a whole range of skills and could offer significant benefits, both financial and other, upon discharge after a period of service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence in allowing me to canvass a lot of these issues fairly broadly. Unfortunately, we do not get enough opportunities in this Parliament to talk about defence. I have been disappointed in the two years I have been here at how few opportunities there have been to talk about what I think is a very important subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Directly related to the legislation: I share the concern that has been expressed on behalf of the Opposition in respect of conscientious objection. I suppose there is a sense in which one could justify conscientiously objecting to one particular war and not another. Unfortunately, once again our thinking on conscription is so much influenced by the Vietnam experience. That, in a way, is unfortunate because that war, as it went on, became an unpopular war. The debate will go on for years perhaps as to what extent Australia was in any way at threat. There are a lot of people who held the view at the time&mdash;and the Government of the day certainly held the view&mdash;that we were acting very much in Australia's interest by being there. I shared the view at the time that there was a genuine reason for us to be there. As time went by, it became controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that national servicemen, as they were called at that time, were serving there also formed part of that controversy. However, in my own experience once again, not a great number of national servicemen, if any&mdash;there probably were some&mdash;were sent there against their will. In my experience, any national serviceman at the time who did not want to go to Vietnam was provided with a way out. That might have been more difficult for those who were serving in infantry battalions and who had been trained with the battalion, but generally, national servicemen who were serving with battalions and other units that needed to train cohesively and who had any particular concern about going to Vietnam were identified very early and were posted out of those units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I have tried to put the whole question of conscription into context. It has been an issue since 1901. It will continue to be an important issue. In many respects our thinking of it, purely in terms of the Vietnam experience, is misleading. There were reasons why people conscientiously objected to service in Vietnam&mdash;perhaps because they did not agree with that particular war&mdash;but I think, as other Opposition speakers said, it sets a very dangerous precedent for us to take the view that people ought to make that decision to conscientiously object to one particular war rather than another. I do not have any particular or real problem with the concept of conscientious objection. I believe that people can feel that way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for what has been an excellent analysis of the obligations of national service and conscription. The reason I intervened before in suggesting that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, is quite wrong in trying to narrow the base of this debate is that, as we all know, the subject of conscription and the extent to which individuals in our society may be called on to serve their country in the armed forces is probably one of the most fundamental that can be debated in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of no use debating a piece of legislation of this character on a non-broadcasting night and pretending that, because of that, there is no reason for us to look at why the legislation is before us, when and under what circumstances conscription might be enforced and what changes may flow from the changes that we are now debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has found, the rocky road to Damascus a la the by-election in Wills is a pretty treacherous path. We have heard how he is changing his attitude on tariffs. Even if this legislation may have had its genesis in the Gulf commitment and in undertakings given to the Australian Democrats, it is really not for that reason alone sufficient for us to just think we can look at the very narrow issue of this Bill and determine in what circumstances young Australian men and women can be sent to their death in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this Defence Legislation Amendment Bill is about. It is a fundamental piece of legislation and a demonstration of the power of the state against the individual. I am fascinated at its timing. One of the consequences of the changes pursued by Labor has been the extent to which it has spent a great deal of money on equipment and has sought to fundamentally reduce the human capacity of the services to provide what many of us believe is an adequate defence response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let me just look at adequate defence response. To me, adequate defence response is to provide a sufficient deterrent so that we need never send Australians to war. What the Government is doing is not looking at the way by which it can provide the positive element in this Bill; it is looking at the negatives. It is trying to set up a parameter where, having failed in providing sufficient attraction for a voluntary service, it is looking at conditions whereby it is going to handicap an obligatory service. I want to look at a couple of the implications of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains three parts relating to the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, the Defence Housing Authority Act and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act. While I do not in any way deny that there have been significant benefits out of the Defence Housing Authority, I believe there are better ways to give some added benefit to service men and women by encouraging them to buy their own homes. I am not too sure that having an authority is the right and correct way to do that. All this does is provide another representative. The Defence Force Assistant Chief (Personnel) will probably be able to make a contribution, but all we are doing is getting more bureaucracy. Whether it is in the Defence Housing Authority or anywhere else, we have to start reducing our bureaucracy, not augmenting it. Whatever this Government does seems to add to the costs of everything we do. But let us put that aside and come to the nub of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nub of this Bill relates to conscription. There are parts of these changes which all of us in our right minds would endorse. We certainly need to look at the conscription classes. They are anachronistic; there is reason to change them. We need to look at the way those who are going to apply for conscientious objection should be judged in the conscientious objection tribunals. Those provisions are okay. The repeal of section 61(2) and the provision of a definition of `conscientious belief' I think are satisfactory. It enables the people to know exactly what we mean by a conscientious objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But conscientious objection and conscription need to be put in their context. The Labor Party needs to understand that it has had leaders such as Billy Hughes, who was prepared to actually change sides in this place on this issue. It needs to be understood that this Bill goes to the core of the nationalism that our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is suddenly finding is his new light on the hill. I believe that Australia's sanctity and the preservation of our nation and its national interests are pre-eminent to the responsibility of government and of government concerns, but I am equally concerned that in looking at this legislation we seem to be coming to all those compromises that the Labor Party has made almost a profession. If it is not the factional compromises, it is bending over backwards to accommodate the Democrats: `If I scratch your back, you will scratch mine; if I give you this, you will give me that vote'. Frankly, I have just about had enough of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is in an appalling state and, as far as our defence capacity is concerned, this legislation hamstrings the defence forces yet again. Nobody wants conscription. Nobody wants to fight a war. But, as I have said, my idea of a defence force is a defence force sufficiently strong, sufficiently capable, sufficiently well-structured, sufficiently well-armed, sufficiently well-provisioned that we can be self-sufficient&mdash;and there is no doubt about it; under Labor we are not&mdash;and nobody would want to attack us or intrude on our national interests. It is in that climate, all other things having failed, that I accept that there are circumstances where, if the nation is under threat, we may need to call on the services of those who do not see fit to volunteer. Nobody likes requiring people to serve, but this Bill is so handicapping of a future government that, if it should want to call on them, I wonder whether our national interest will be protected. </PARA>

I have identified several parts of the Bill which I do endorse, but it is those bits that are ridiculous that make me suspect this rocky road to Damascus a la the by-election in Wills that I spoke of earlier.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not only the 90-day bit that worries me. Has the Minister ever heard of saying to an enlisted soldier, `Look, I am terribly sorry, we have an attack on us from Kamaria. We have an exercise called Kangaroo `92, and we have developed a fictional enemy called Kamaria'? To my mind Kamaria virtually epitomises all of the nasties. It does not matter that it looks like an inverted Tasmania and it is stuck in a place where there is no land mass; what it does is reflect a conceptual enemy. The Minister's proposition suggests that people would say, `Okay, I have been called up. What the hell do I do about it? Those Kamarians are nasty folk. I could not possibly object to them wanting to come over to my country'. This is a double whammy. They are given 90 days to reflect while we go through this ridiculous process of consultation, then we say, in any event,`It doesn't matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; the honourable member is right. The honourable member describes it so well. `If you do like them, if you have a cuddly feeling for that particular enemy'&mdash;it just does not make sense. If the Minister wants to be classified as the master of the absurd, he should proceed with this legislation as it is at the moment. I am quite prepared to endorse those parts of the legislation which are sensible; those parts which are ridiculous should be deleted. If they are not deleted, the rest of the legislation will be thrown into vivid contrast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just that. I have said in other places that I am very concerned about a number of things that are happening in the Defence Force, and one is the extent to which the commanding officers, the people wearing a purple uniform or the uniform of their distinct service, have a capacity to command their forces and to maintain good order and discipline among those who are responsible to them. We all know the difficulty in military service, and many of us feel very sad at the plight of many of those who are serving at the moment. There is no doubt that there are disadvantages in some of the restrictions that Service life entails, but it is important that there is this concept of command and control, that the concepts of military authority and discipline are maintained, even though they might be anathema to a peace force in time of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, I want a deterrent force. I do not want Australia ever to have to be involved in a war, but I recognise that, with the bipartisan support of members of this House, we have been involved in peacekeeping roles over a number of years. There are circumstances where again, although God forbid, we may need to have the commitment of Australian forces to defend our national sovereignty or to defend against those who seek to intrude upon it. In that climate we have to make sure that we maintain the discipline and the authority of those who are at the head of the armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage I thought of inserting into the definitions within clause 4 of this amending Bill a definition that ensured that there was no doubt that the Chief of the Defence Force and the chiefs of each of the individual services had their own capacity to ensure, for example, that there was no question of the human rights and equal opportunities legislation intruding on the exercise of that responsibility. Certainly, when that legislation is before this Parliament again, I will seek to ensure that no legislation like that intrudes on the capacity of the chiefs of the Defence Force to exercise their command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in this whole field of conscription, we have to make sure that chiefs of staff and other people defined in this legislation&mdash;for example, the new definition in this legislation includes the vice-chief of the Defence Force &mdash;have the capacity to exercise their authority. We cannot have pieces of legislation, such as the human rights and equal opportunities legislation, intruding and preventing them exercising their responsibility. That relates to homosexuality and all those questions that must come back to the responsibility of those who are wearing a uniform and are called on to exercise their prime authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscription is no different. Of course, in our society we have to provide exemptions; for example, the definition, more precisely, of the term `conscientious belief'. When I first rose to speak I identified those parts of these changes which I think are good. I think the idea of setting up these tribunals is good, but for us to go as far as this legislation does at this time raises doubts. To produce the ridiculous in talking about 90 days notice and in providing objection for a particular war and then to undermine the authority of the chiefs of staff, as the Minister at the table has by statements he has made about the obligations of the human rights and equal opportunities legislation, casts real doubt on the capacity of the Australian Defence Force to maintain that deterrent capacity which is fundamental to ensuring that it can undertake its prime role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is not just a superficial piece of legislation. That is why when I rose I commended the honourable member for McPherson. He and a number of other honourable members, including yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, have been conscripted at a different time, in a different way and for different reasons. I hope that, as time passes and circumstances change, conscription will never again be necessary. I understand that the Government, in its concern to try to placate the Democrats, felt that now was the hour to respond to its Gulf undertakings, but I do not think the result is what we want. I hope that when the Minister reflects on this legislation he might see fit to delete those parts to which the Opposition so strongly objects. The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) identified those parts in which we are going to seek deletions in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This should not be a measure in which there is a partisan difference between the sides of the Parliament. I know that within this Parliament those who have served as conscripts may feel even stronger than those of us who were members of a government which introduced national service at the time of the Vietnam war. They may feel differently from those members of the Government looking at this in a climate in which they are trying to placate those warring factions of which we see and hear so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a bit more fundamental. It is about human beings. It is about the ultimate obligation that service in the uniform of Australia, the uniform of the Queen of Australia, provides. I respect those men and women who serve Australia. I respect their dedication and, above all, the fact that so many of them joined voluntarily. They offer something all of us need to reflect on: they are prepared, as a result of their service to Australia, to offer their lives, should it be necessary, for the sake of the preservation of those qualities which are fundamental to everything that this Parliament represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, if we are to introduce any form of conscription which removes that voluntary element, it requires deliberation and consideration, but not ridiculous compromise. To my mind, those two matters&mdash;particular war objection and the 90-day notice&mdash;make an absolute farce of the piece of legislation which is fundamental to the freedom of every Australian. I hope that the Minister will reflect on those and see fit to have them deleted before they go before the Senate. </PARA>

It was a credit to one of my constituents, the Royal Agricultural Society of Queensland President, John Blakeney, and to his busy committees, who ensured that, despite the extent of the rural commodity downturn and unparalleled drought conditions over the last couple of years, provincial and rural Australians were able to show what can be achieved for themselves, for their families and for the nation with substantial commitment and industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has forced the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, which in 100 years has had only one pro-Labor editorial&mdash;and that was in 1989 prior to the Queensland election&mdash;to suggest that Queensland Young Nationals were part of the Ku Klux Klan&mdash;as indeed they are.

We on this side of the House look to the creation of one nation in which all of us can stand with equality and dignity before the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) should be ashamed of himself for not warning the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) that he was going to carry on as he did in this chamber tonight.

<PARA>more of this `reds under the bed' stuff that we used to hear from a former Queensland Premier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Labor Government has sold out in favour of supporting our Treasury's greatest parasites: the unionists, the Aborigines, the single-mothers and the not so genuine unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not surprising that a member of a party that introduced the most regressive anti-union legislation in Australia should hold such a view of trade unionists. Nor is it surprising that a member of the Queensland National Party should be so racist as to describe Aborigines as parasites, or that a member of a party which has never distinguished itself by its commitment to the underprivileged should describe single mothers and the unemployed in a similar manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about the whole episode is that, based on the record of the National Party in these areas, Mr Smith felt comfortable in making such blatantly racist, sexist and anti-worker remarks in the official newspaper of the Party's youth wing. I should say right wing, because that is what it is. Honourable members should also be aware that these remarks occurred in an issue of the magazine which carried a picture of the Queensland Leader of the National Party, Mr Rob Borbidge, on its cover. An endorsement of the magazine by Mr Borbidge was also contained in the issue, in which he said that the magazine&mdash;and cop this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . serves as a vital communication role for the party and deserves your support.</PARA>
<PARA>Rubbish it does! The Queensland Opposition Leader later tried to distance himself from the remarks, saying that the views expressed in the newsletter were not necessarily those of the National Party. But it makes us all wonder, does it not? Such a disclaimer by the Queensland Opposition Leader is, of course, of little substance because, if the National Party were a party with any commitment to combating racist and sexist attitudes in society, a person such as Jake Smith would have no place in the organisation if he made such a comment. It should sack him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from backing away from his earlier statements, Mr Smith later went on to make further outrageous statements on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. He is reported in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> as being in favour of abolishing the Party's Aboriginal affairs policy altogether. The article reports that, in a speech to the Central Council meeting of the Party, Mr Smith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Aborigines represented less than 1 per cent of the population but had a separate Minister and Government Department . . . people were sick and tired of having a special policy for Aborigines.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I raised in the adjournment debate the question of an 87-year-old Changi veteran from my electorate who had been refused the right to private treatment for his medical problems at a local level. He is an 87-year-old man, bedridden for most of the time, with an 80-year-old wife who obviously could not travel the distance required to get to the repatriation general hospital in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I described the situation of this man and the reply that I received from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I hoped, as I said in that contribution last week, that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) would override his ministerial bureaucrats and allow my constituent to be treated locally. The Minister came into the House and, unfortunately, said no, he would not do anything like that. He raised this matter to a political level by saying that we on this side of the House had voted against legislation that he had introduced into the House last year which would have allowed, he said, the integration of repatriation general hospitals into the general hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we voted against that legislation was a very clear one: it did not give clear rights of access to veterans in a way which was unequivocal. It was opposed</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply, the Minister said that he would take every opportunity to bring home to people, when they brought individual cases to his attention, the fact that we had opposed that legislation. Well, he was true to his word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned this case to the Minister this afternoon. It is an absolute disgrace that a Minister of the Crown should turn a situation like this, in which an 87-year-old Changi veteran needs special treatment, into a political football and use this man to blackmail the Opposition into changing its attitude towards the legislation which the Minister introduced into the House. He said that he would do that at that time. It is a situation which I find very regrettable, because I have a lot of time for the Minister concerned. But the fact that this Minister and this Government would use an 87-year-old Changi veteran as a political football is a sad indictment on the state of politics to which this Government has brought the Australian population. </PARA>

We have pursued this through our participation in the General Conferences of UNESCO and the efforts of our mission to UNESCO in Paris. Separately, Dr Peter Wilenski, while Ambassador to our UN Mission in New York, has been a member of a review team evaluating UNESCO Secretariat reform. The latest review, contained in a report of 15 January 1992, has commented positively on steps taken to re-structure and improve the professionalism of UNESCO on a range of staffing issues; on delegation of financial authority to programme areas; and on decentralisation of personnel and functions from Paris. The review considers that while administrative reform is now on track, a determined effort will still be needed to institutionalise this so that it becomes the natural working process of the organisation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia is committed to the universal observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights. Human rights concerns are taken into account in the foreign aid program and each situation is considered on a case by case basis. For example, the provision of aid to Burma was suspended on human rights grounds and, after the events of June 1989, aid to China was severely curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's aid and human rights policies share the overall objective of seeking to improve the situation on the ground for the ordinary citizen. The Government considers that a direct and inflexible linking of aid to the human rights performance of recipient countries can be counterproductive and may further disadvantage those most in need of assistance.</PARA>
