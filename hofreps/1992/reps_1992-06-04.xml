<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and in the absence of the Chairman, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) on parliamentary business overseas, I present the report of the Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Legal Casinos and Organised Criminal Activity</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CE4">Mr O'KEEFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under paragraph 55(1)(d) of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 it is the duty of the Committee to examine trends and changes in criminal activities, practices and methods and report to both Houses of the Parliament any change which the Committee thinks desirable to the functions, structure, powers and procedures of the Authority. Pursuant to this duty the Committee decided in December 1990 to conduct an inquiry into aspects of the establishment and operation of legal casinos in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I have just presented announces that the Committee has decided not to pursue this inquiry at this stage. Two members of the Committee, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and Senator Crichton-Browne, have dissented from this decision. The Committee emphasises in the report that it is not terminating its inquiry; it is merely suspending it. Early in the next Parliament the Committee will review the decision to suspend its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report sets out the background to the Committee's decision and I will briefly summarise the reasons. Since the Committee decided in December 1990 to undertake the casino inquiry, three other inquiries commenced which have looked at aspects of possible criminal involvement in legal casinos. The Committee wishes to avoid duplicating the work of these inquiries. The first is the Street inquiry in New South Wales. On 6 August 1991, the New South Wales Government announced an inquiry into the establishment and operation of legal casinos in New South Wales. The inquiry was headed by the Honourable Sir Laurence Street and reported in November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of direct relevance to the Parliamentary Joint Committee's inquiry, the Street report stated that the regulatory scheme proposed for the New South Wales casinos was one:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in which the casinos can be protected from criminal influence and exploitation, kept free from money laundering and maintained as places for honest gaming.</PARA>
<PARA>The Street report also identified the exchange of operating information and criminal intelligence and the establishment of a database to assist in the licensing processes for casino operators and staff as areas in which a nationally coordinated approach would be of benefit. The report also considered that a more formal and structured approach was highly desirable in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second inquiry that I refer to is the National Crime Authority's inquiry into money laundering. In December 1990 the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) gave a reference to the NCA to investigate money laundering. As a result of the NCA's work on that reference, it became apparent that one aspect of investigations would be the extent to which legal casinos would or could be used to launder money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1992, the National Crime Authority reported to the Attorney-General on its inquiry. The non-confidential parts of the report were released to the public last month. The NCA inquiry brought to light no known cases whereby casinos were used to conceal the origin of criminal funds. Casinos were not found to be used for laundering money in Australia in the commonly accepted view of the phrase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the NCA inquiry did identify some matters of concern in relation to casinos. The NCA has recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General refer the NCA's findings in relation to the casino industry to the appropriate State Governments, with the recommendations that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) consideration be given to the establishment of a National Casino Standards Organisation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) junket operators should be licensed and all participants on junket tours should be fully identified.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General is preparing the Government's response to this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there is the Western Australian Royal Commission which was established in January 1991. It was appointed in Western Australia to inquire and report on whether, amongst other matters, there had been corrupt, illegal or improper conduct by anyone in the affairs of the Western Australian Government or its agencies in respect of the Burswood Island Casino. The Parliamentary Joint Committee has also received evidence on this matter. The Royal Commission sat in June and July 1991 for some 25 days hearing evidence and argument on the Burswood matter. It has not yet reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the findings and recommendations of the Street and NCA inquiries, and the fact that the Western Australian Royal Commission has heard casino related evidence but has not yet reported, the Committee considers it would be unproductive to pursue its inquiry at this stage. When, early in the next Parliament, the Committee reviews its decision to suspend the inquiry, it will take into account any action by governments in response to the Street and NCA inquiries and whether the Western Australian Royal Commission has reported and sufficient time has elapsed for its findings to be acted upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Committee expresses its appreciation to all those who have made submissions and in other ways assisted its inquiry. On behalf of the Chairman&mdash;who, as I mentioned earlier, is overseas on Government business&mdash;I want to convey the appreciation of the Committee for the efforts of our staff and the work that they have done on this inquiry to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to indicate my dissent from the decision of the Committee to suspend the inquiry. My view is based on a number of reasons for which I will refer, more or less directly, to my dissenting report. During the next year or so, applicants will be selected and new casinos will be opening in Cairns, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and on Christmas Island. The deferral of the inquiry will mean that the Committee's findings will not be available during the licensing and establishment of these new casinos. By delaying its findings, the Committee risks trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. This is compounded by the fact that the Committee's inquiry was the first opportunity for the general community to comment on casinos as a national issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of the Christmas Island casino. Christmas Island will rely on its casino as its principal source of income. This will put extra pressure on casino regulators to overlook irregularities in order to keep the casino operating and the revenue coming in. It is planned that the Christmas Island casino will be administered under Western Australian legislation. That Western Australian legislation has been strongly criticised in relation to the licensing process for the Burswood Island casino. It is a matter of regret that the Casino Island&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Downer" NAMEID="4G4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr Downer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may as well be called Casino Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QT4">Mr FILING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as the honourable member for Mayo says, perhaps it should be called Casino Island. It is a matter of regret that the Christmas Island casino is going ahead with no public inquiry at all. The relationship between crime and legal casinos, raised in the NCA's report and elsewhere, is still a matter of concern. It is our view&mdash;that is, the authors of the dissenting report&mdash;that the submissions made to the Committee substantiate the need for the continuation of the inquiry and the opportunity to further examine witnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the arguments raised by the Committee to substantiate my view that the Committee's inquiry has been put into cold storage. The Committee's report cites the report of the 1991 inquiry into the establishment and operation of legal casinos in New South Wales, headed by the Hon. Sir Laurence Street, and the National Crime Authority's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taken to the Cleaners: Money Laundering in Australia</EMPHASIS>, December 1991, to support its view that the Committee's inquiry should be suspended. The Committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement in the Street Report that the provisions of the draft Casino Control Bill would protect casinos from `criminal influence and exploitation, kept free from money laundering and maintained as places for honest gaming' was qualified in the same paragraph as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, the measure of success in achieving an honest, crime-free gaming environment will depend upon the capacity, commitment and diligence of the administration and enforcement of the mechanisms and controls. The stature and independence of the (Casino Control) Authority and philosophy of `people watching people watching people', embodied in the statutory scheme, as well as the requirement of accountability through reporting to Parliament, justified confidence in the quality of the administration and enforcement of the mechanism and controls.</PARA>
<PARA>The same report warned of the need for care in the use of documents produced in other contexts in support of arguments to his inquiry that were critical of the casino industry. In particular, there was a paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gambling in Australia</EMPHASIS>, produced by the Australian Institute of Criminology in 1990, that was used by a number of submissions to the Street inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraph 2.3.4, the Street report described how the Institute's view in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gambling in Australia</EMPHASIS> fitted into the framework of the report. By emphasising the central tenets of effective regulation, adequate and workable powers, allocation of sufficient resources for the regulatory task and an active commitment on the part of government to achieving the regulatory goals, the Institute pinpointed the importance of the behaviour of those responsible for proper licensing, supervision and review procedures to ensure that the opportunity for corruption is kept to an absolute minimum. In order to prevent criminal infiltration, the Street report called for a national system for the coordination of information exchange, intelligence gathering and assessment of operators and employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These views were supported by the National Crime Authority's report into money laundering. It recommended that the Attorney-General refer the NCA's findings in relation to the casino industry to the appropriate State governments with the recommendations that consideration be given to the establishment of a national casino standards organisation and that junket operators should be licensed and all participants on junket tours should be fully identified. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In conducting this inquiry, the Committee was concerned to ensure that the industry maintained its competitive edge and realised its full potential through continuing development of technological expertise, better training and use of skilled personnel. The Committee received 60 submissions and 85 exhibits and recorded over 700 pages of evidence from public hearings in Adelaide, Cairns, Canberra, Fremantle, Launceston, Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney. The Committee visited eight shipyards in six centres around Australia. These sites provided a very worthwhile overview of a diversified industry, ranging through successful pleasure craft, catamarans and Anzac ships construction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent history of the Australian shipbuilding industry entails considerable changes in structure and direction. The key developments have been the rationalisation of the number of shipyards, improved technology, a move away from steel to aluminium and an orientation towards export markets. The industry now focuses on the production of fishing vessels, luxury yachts, high speed ferries, tugs and smaller commercial and naval vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1984 and 1989, export orders for Australian built ships increased from nil to $150m. This year exports of these vessels will account for over $200m. Shipbuilders specialising in lightweight materials secured most of these orders. They are considered to be world leaders and currently have 10 per cent of the global market share of lightweight high speed vessels. The latest example of innovative design and technology produced by this sector is the development of 74-metre wave piercing catamaran ferries for the international market. While this occurred, there has, however, been a downturn in industry employment. Those working for registered shipbuilders fell from 2,900 in June 1989 to a little under 1,900 in May 1991. Hopefully, the success of the lightweight sector of the industry will increase confidence within the private sector and lead to greater investment in the shipbuilding industry overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The production of large steel-hulled ships in Australia has declined markedly over the last two decades. However, shipbuilders have a market opportunity over the next decade as the world fleet of bulk carriers requires replacement. This expectation has prompted a proposal for a major shipbuilding and marine engineering facility at Port Kembla on the New South Wales south coast. The private sector has shown interest and, given the employment potential, the Committee considers that further examination of the viability of the project is warranted. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Government contribute up to half a million dollars towards a feasibility study of the project, provided that the private sector is prepared to contribute at least 75 per cent of the cost of the study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian shipbuilders have, since 1947, received a bounty to assist them in meeting the cost of ship construction. These payments were initially restricted to vessels for use in Australia coastal waters. In 1984 the bounty was extended to cover eligible vessels built for export. In 1988 the Industries Assistance Commission reviewed the bounty and concluded that, while the bounty enabled industry to enter export markets, it was not encouraging a viable, efficient industry. As a result of that report, the bounty is being phased out, ending in July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee agrees with the conclusions of the Industry Assistance Commission report, it recognises the concern of the industry that, as it is being phased out in Australia, there is a significant problem whereby some competitor nations are continuing to subsidise their shipbuilding industries both directly and indirectly. The Committee considers that the Government needs to examine some other ways to assist the industry to maintain its liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other assistance to the industry currently provided by the Government includes export enhancement, research and development schemes, import duty concessions and export finance. The Committee recommends that such schemes be consolidated and their delivery to the industry be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government regulations which affect the industry can be both industry specific and general. The Committee is aware that general industry regulations such as labour market provisions, occupational health and safety requirements and environmental protection measures can serve to increase manufacturers' costs and decrease international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers, however, that many of these regulations establish workplace and social standards which reflect community expectations and therefore should be accepted as part of the cost of production. The Committee notes that some reform of labour market regulations, specifically in the development of enterprise based agreements, is occurring, which will assist the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example of industry specific regulation which has a major impact on the shipbuilding industry is the uniform shipping laws code. Complaints were received that the USL is administered differently in the various States. The Committee recommends that the States and Commonwealth review the administration of the USL to ensure that it is enforced uniformly throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major issue currently facing the shipbuilding industry is the provision of adequate financing for shipbuilding loans. We note the timely conference on innovative financing for the industry convened in Sydney late last month. This joint venture of DITAC, EFIC and legal and financial fields signals this major problem for this sector of the economy. The principal financier for these loans is often the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two areas of concern to shipbuilders are the time delays in processing loan applications and EFIC's policy of taking only 30 per cent to 50 per cent of the value of a vessel as security for a loan. The Committee recommends that EFIC review its policy, so that it accords more closely with overseas financiers, otherwise our exporters face major impediments. It is expected that some of the causes for complaints will be eased by changes made to EFIC in November last year. The Committee recommends that the effectiveness of these changes in allowing EFIC to become more market orientated be reviewed later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant cause of delay in loan approvals is the lack of adequate information provided by exporters themselves. Shipbuilders need to be more aware of the information needs of EFIC to streamline application processing, and the Committee recommends that EFIC prepare an information kit for use by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a widespread concern among shipbuilders over the level of, and fluctuations in, Australian interest rates. These adversely effect the provision of competitive financing for shipbuilding loans. The Committee considers that the creation of special tax free savings accounts, as a means of creating investment funds for Australian industry, should be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government assistance in export marketing for the shipbuilding industry is provided by Austrade. Comments received by the Committee on the value of Austrade ranged from very supportive to extremely negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade's preferred approach for the industry is to work with sectoral interest groups, such as the Australian Ferrybuilders Association and the Australian Marine Export Group, to foster an awareness of Australian shipbuilders in overseas markets. While Austrade could not place a value on the service it supplies to shipbuilders, Austrade's presence does assist in marketing the shipbuilding industry overseas. The Committee believes that to pass final judgment on the adequacy of Austrade in assisting the shipbuilding industry will be premature, as the changes recommended by the McKinsey and Co. review are still being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small companies, such as builders of leisure and leisure craft, often fall outside the guidelines for Austrade's services, and the Committee suggests that steps should be taken to encourage the greater use of the export access program by these firms. The importance of research and development to the future of the industry was stressed throughout the inquiry. This research and development, however, must be responsive to the needs of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that in December 1991 the Government announced approval for the establishment of the Australian Marine Engineering Cooperative Research Centre. The Committee considers that the Cooperative Research Centre approach is appropriate to meet the demand for research and development facilities. Its progress, research outcomes and level of usage by industry will indicate whether the establishment of a federally funded research centre is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major avenues for Government support for research and development are via the 150 per cent tax concession and through programs such as the industry research and development grants scheme, the national procurement development program and the advanced manufacturing technology development program. The Committee is concerned about the confusion amongst shipbuilders as to what research and development grants are available and their reluctance to apply for assistance because of difficulties with the bureaucratic process. There is a need for DITAC to more closely coordinate these assistance schemes and to improve their delivery to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In building for the future, the shipbuilding industry must look to its training needs. University courses in naval architecture are viewed by many in the industry as less practical and up-to-date than required, owing to the rapidly changing technology used by the industry. There is a need to combine practical and theoretical knowledge in such a way that graduates have immediately useful skills when entering the industry. More flexibility in the structure of courses offered would benefit the industry by providing graduates with both sound theoretical backgrounds and relevant practical experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is of the view that while a formal four-year naval architecture degree may not be necessary to undertake boat and ship design successfully or to oversee construction projects, there is a growing need for some formal qualifications to be held, particularly as the skill base of the industry increases. The Committee therefore recommends that the Australian Shipbuilders Association and the boat manufacturers, in conjunction with the Australian division of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, draw up minimum qualifications for registration as a boat or ship designer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipbuilders were enthusiastic about the benefits of the apprenticeship scheme. The Committee endorses the emergence of enterprise based educational programs and suggests that the Commonwealth work with the States, industry and unions to develop a system of training wages based on percentage of full adult wages, incorporating the recognition over time of increasing skills attainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naval procurement has a major impact on the shipbuilding industry. The Department of Defence has in place policies to encourage Australian content in its acquisition programs. The high levels of local production in the submarine and Anzac ship projects reflect its approach. Australian involvement in these programs is likely to have flow-on effects for Australian industry involvement in major defence contracts in the future, and hence export opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region and in its offshore oil and gas projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the Committee members. A very tight schedule was kept to in the last month to finalise these matters. I would also like to thank the Committee staff, particularly for their work in that period. I commend the report. </PARA>

The honourable member has given an excellent summary of that report. For an island nation with the largest warm-water coastline in the world and the advantages of a developed economy and abundant natural resources, our shipbuilding industry has not been as successful as it should be. For a nation which in total tonnage of goods exported ranks second in the world, our shipbuilding industry has been singularly lacking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ships only a small percentage of its exports in Australian owned ships and an even smaller percentage, in fact a positively minute proportion, in Australian constructed vessels.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this inquiry, members of the Committee visited most major yards in Australia, as the honourable member for Reid has indicated. They also visited support facilities, held inquiries in all States, and are now tabling what I believe to be a very worthwhile and thought-provoking report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Wake of the Bounty</EMPHASIS> examines aspects of the industry which are the most prosperous, and explains why. It also investigates the areas of shipbuilding which are not currently buoyant, and suggests reasons why this has happened and what might be done to improve the industry. A major feature of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Wake of the Bounty</EMPHASIS> is its discussion on the potential of the industry, which I believe is considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipbuilding in Australia should be a basic industry, an industry in which we could, if we applied the correct policies, be very successful&mdash;and not just in niche markets as we are at the moment. Australians are already world leaders in the design and construction of high-speed, lightweight vessels up to 40 metres, as was suggested by the honourable member for Reid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AMECON in Melbourne is building world-class naval surface vessels at what was formerly the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. We are building world-class submarines at the Australian Submarine Corporation yard at Port Adelaide. It is interesting to note that in the first instance these yards are successful, almost in spite of the hazardous financial packages offered in Australia. In the case of the naval vessels, of course, and the submarines, the actual finance is being provided by the Australian taxpayer. What Australia needs is to have this industry working within a simple set of guidelines, supported by financial arrangements which are both competitive and predictable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, almost without exception, those people in the industry who contributed to the report spoke of finance being a significant and continuing problem. For example, a few words from the Australian Shipbuilders Association's submission to the inquiry clearly illustrate this point. The submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Undoubtedly the biggest single factor which if addressed aggressively would do much to enhance this industry is the provision of readily available finance for ship owners, packages which at least match those of overseas countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr J. Rothwell from Austral Ships Pty Ltd put the problem even more succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could probably double our orders at the moment if we could get a more substantial or a more attractive finance package out of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent months speakers from both sides of the House have called for the introduction of a tax-free savings scheme in Australia. The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) and I have suggested various schemes, all of which are based on a similar concept. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends examination of such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quickly outline one such scheme this morning. The main features of such a scheme are: interest on the deposits is tax free; the size of the deposits and interest accrued will have no effect on other social security payments; the maximum limit on deposits will be, say, a quarter of a million dollars; and, interest payable will be 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it is clear that high and unpredictable interest rates contribute to a lack of competitiveness in the international marketplace. They drain the confidence of individuals in an industry. A finance package negotiated at 10 per cent interest can be good business. However, if that interest rate suddenly becomes 20 or 25 per cent, it can spell disaster&mdash;and it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to Australia, countries such as Japan enjoy a significant advantage in respect of interest rates, as such countries have benefited from a long established policy of encouraging domestic savings. For example, in Japan, individuals have been able to make deposits in Maruyu-type accounts. The pool of capital established by small savers investing in those accounts has provided funds for much of the rebuilding of the Japanese economy. For instance, at the end of March 1986, 25 per cent of all personal deposits in Japan were held in this manner, representing some 20 per cent of total savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why the same principle cannot be applied in Australia. Accumulated funds would become a source of cheaper funds for the development of export industries involving shipbuilding; import replacement production, such as replacements for ships; and high-tech projects, such as robots and laser development which can contribute to manufacturing techniques. Such a fund would be controlled by the Commonwealth Development Bank. This institution has a proven track record and is the appropriate bank to administer such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deposits in such a fund should be tax free and earn interest at a rate of around 3 per cent. The minimum deposit limit would be between $150,000 and $250,000. However, the size of the deposit and the interest earned should not affect a person's eligibility to other entitlements. As I said, access to the fund should be controlled by the Commonwealth Development Bank. Finance at 5 per cent would be available only to, say, Australian-owned companies. That certainly would help the shipbuilding industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank embraces the establishment and development of business ventures, including primary production and small business. In its role as manager of the tax-free savings accounts, the bank would be directed to become proactive as the administrator of high priority projects in industries such as shipbuilding. The aim of this proposal is to encourage savings in Australia while simultaneously encouraging the development of industries such as shipbuilding which can contribute to genuine employment and opportunities for wealth creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where significant progress has already been made is in industrial relations. The shipbuilding industry should be commended for its success in this area. AMECON, with union agreement, has dramatically cut the numbers of unions on the site and revolutionised productivity. Productivity increases are on average nearly 800 per cent, with some aspects of production increasing by over 2,000 per cent. Likewise, the submarines are being built very efficiently.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The smaller yards are non-unionised and have high productivity and employer involvement in agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Wake of the Bounty</EMPHASIS> lists many excellent recommendations, which I trust will be implemented. However, there is one aspect which is general to shipbuilding and covered in this report, and that is the application and retention of intellectual property. The expertise build-up in the various establishments should not be lost due to the lack of continuity of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with re-establishing a shipbuilding industry is that we are more or less just re-inventing the wheel. The shipbuilding skills, for instance, at Whyalla have been lost. The shipbuilding skills at Carrington in Newcastle have largely been lost. The engineering and technical expertise now assembled at AMECON should never be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was raised by Dr John White, the Managing Director of AMECON. He expressed the concern that having established a world-class facility, it should not be allowed to disappear&mdash;likewise, with the Australian Submarine Corporation. Many of its developed skills, such as the welding techniques employed, are world class. Its largest subcontractor, Rockwells, which is providing the fire control system or the electronic fighting capability of the submarine, have assembled a world-class technical team. This team comprises over 150 highly skilled technical people, and all but a few are Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some countries have such a wealth of enterprise, they can afford to lose an occasional industry in a recession. Australia does not have that luxury. Once lost, these skills or intellectual property will be difficult and costly to replace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary, July-August 1991. We were extraordinarily fortunate to have visited the four former Eastern Bloc countries following the very recent downfall of their communist regimes. What I will be saying today mirrors, to a very large extent, what the President of the Senate has said in presenting the report in that chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were also extraordinarily fortunate in meeting the leaders in each of those countries that I have mentioned&mdash;in most cases, the President, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and number of other Ministers as well. Not only did we meet, of course, the people in senior administrative positions and political positions, but we took every opportunity to meet as many of the citizens of these countries as we possibly could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Poland, we were both privileged and intrigued to meet President Lech Walesa, who was, of course, one of those most closely associated with the ousting of the communists in Poland. The example of the success of Solidarity led by Walesa encouraged public expressions of opposition by dissident movements in other countries of the region. One could legitimately say that in many senses Poland kicked the whole process off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we went around, we were struck by the political and economic problems facing each of the countries. They simply cannot be overestimated. As an example, Lech Walesa told us that he much regretted that there was not an historic blueprint for the conversion from a communist command economy to a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each country faces in a very real sense a catch-22 situation: without a stable political environment, foreign investors will be discouraged; without foreign investment to assist in the funding of economic recovery, political instability is bound to continue. One of the great problems that is faced by these countries is that the expectations that so many people have following the move away from communism simply cannot be achieved in the short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found that crippling levels of foreign debt discourage foreign investment and trade. For example, Bulgaria's foreign debt of $US11 billion is almost 25 per cent of its gross national product. It is simply unable to service the debt. We went to several places which demonstrated in a very real sense the economic downturn. One of the most evident of these was the city of Lodz, a large industrial centre that we visited in Poland. As we went through Lodz we passed block after block of factories which had closed down. Unemployment in that city exceeded 30 per cent when we were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention Lodz because it was the main centre in Poland for the processing of Australian wool. We found that our market for wool in Poland has now collapsed. It serves as an example of the plight of industry in eastern Europe because its manufacturing plant and its processes are outmoded and inefficient. Without substantial investment in new plant and technology there is very little prospect that Polish industries can successfully compete in world markets. Without investment there are no funds to purchase raw materials or to provide jobs, and in a very real sense it is a downward spiral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there has been a benefit from the factory closures in many of these countries and that benefit has been the reduction in the level of pollution. One of the other things that has improved, of course, is that we now have a newer fleet of cars and buses in a lot of these countries. The pollution emanating from the old cars and buses was absolutely horrific. As the countries change and more new cars are available, then pollution from motor vehicle emissions will hopefully lessen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the disastrous legacy of the communist promotion of heavy industry fuelled mainly by the inefficient burning of brown coal is polluted air, poisoned rivers and forests which have been destroyed by acid rain. It was very clear, for instance, from the level of pollution in the Danube that the river is just a great drain taking heavy metals and other pollutants through to the Black Sea. It is a very difficult problem to overcome and one which will require a very great capacity for cooperation between the countries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that really struck us was the safety of the Soviet built reactors in the nuclear power stations dotted throughout eastern Europe. That is a real cause for concern. The authorities are aware of the danger but because of their requirements for energy production the reactors simply cannot be closed down unless there is massive Western assistance with the provision of alternative sources of energy. We believe there is a really great opportunity for clean Australian coal to find a market in these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is in all of the countries a general commitment to the development of a market economy, but there are significant differences between the countries and the nature and pace of change. There are also differences amongst political parties and groups in each country about the way reform should be accomplished and the pace of that reform. I believe that there is no doubt that political and economic reforms are painful and will continue to be painful. There is an abiding fear that loss of faith in the benefits to be won from reform may result in the return to power of the communists. There were some indications of that in conversations that we had in the countries that we visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very great factors in all of this is the disintegration of the Soviet Union since the delegation's visit. That has had a marked impact on eastern and central Europe because most of the former Soviet's satellites were dependent on the Soviet Union for more than 50 per cent of their trade. That trade has now evaporated. The countries have to change not only their political focus but also their trade relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, as former Soviet republics emerge from their current difficulties, there will be considerable market opportunities to be won, particularly in the more developed republics. I think particularly of the Ukraine when I mention that. But that is of really small comfort to the countries of east-central Europe which need to establish beneficial trade relations immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very strong conviction in each of the countries that we visited that they must gain membership of the European Community as soon as possible. The facts are that that membership will not be granted quickly in my view. It really needs a significant effort on the part of the European Community to appreciate the difficulties of these newly independent democratic countries and do what it can to bolster the democratic forces which are presently in control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long years of communist domination served to contain simmering nationalist rivalries among the various ethnic groups in these countries. But, with the downfall of the communist governments and the lifting of social repression, ethnic tensions unfortunately now have risen again to the surface. In some cases those tensions have boiled over, as we have seen in Yugoslavia and several former Soviet republics. Hungary's interests in the Hungarian minority in Romania continue to strain relations between those two countries, and Czechoslovakia is threatened with partition by calls for Slovak independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tensions throughout the region make the implementation of political and economical reforms all the more difficult. There is a tremendous opportunity for tourism to be expanded, because these countries have great tourist potential. Surprisingly, many of the people in the countries did not seem to fully appreciate the benefits of tourism, particularly the economic benefits that could accrue by its promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's total trade with the four countries is about $230m. Our exports to the countries slightly exceed our imports from them. I believe we could be doing a great deal more, simply because there are so many groups in Australia that have a familial relationship with the countries the delegation visited. Therefore, Australia is in an excellent position to re-establish those relationships and trade with those countries. We have helped in many ways. There is our membership of the OECD Group of 24, and we have taken a one per cent shareholding in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, representing a grant of $45m over five years. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, it is a region of enormous potential for Australia. It is a fascinating region to look at, particularly its economic and political developments. We truly appreciated the range of people we were able to meet and their hospitality. I want to thank all who were associated with the planning and the implementation of the visit because I think great benefits can come from it. I would encourage members of the House to read the report very carefully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The delegation from the Australian Parliament to countries in central Europe&mdash;including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria&mdash;was a unique opportunity for members of the Australian Parliament to meet newly elected members of parliament in those countries and to examine, at close hand, the effects of the momentous political and economic changes that are occurring as central Europe moves from a command to a market economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt there will continue to be significant problems involved in this huge change. In my view, there will be problems particularly affecting output and employment in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of central Europe. The problems will be further exacerbated in future by the slow rate of investment from foreign sources because there is not nearly enough such investment at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is increasing inflation and unemployment in central Europe as a result of the slowness of change, in my view arising from the low rate of investment. Consequently, there is a danger of increasing disillusionment. This was evident in the turnout of only 40 per cent in last year's Polish elections. It is, in a sense, also evident in the moderate resurgence of some of the better elements of the former regime now currently involved in the democratic left alliance. Nevertheless, one cannot help being impressed by the sense of change and freedom in these countries of central Europe and the sheer political exuberance which prevails there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task for the newly liberated nations of central Europe is obviously to rebuild their economies and to gradually eliminate the extensive pollution which has occurred under the former regime. There will be future trade opportunities for Australia. They will be real but they will be limited. There is a contraction of output as a result of the decline of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or the old Comecon, and this has greatly affected output and exports. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) mentioned the effect of the collapse of CMEA on the Australian wool trade with Poland, as Polish exports to the former USSR have declined with the collapse of Comecon. Another example of the contraction of the former Comecon is the rapid decline of the arms manufacturing industry in Slovakia. This is a very welcome development from our point of view, but from the point of view of the people around Bratislava there is a huge loss of employment involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree also that there are opportunities for the export of Australian coal to central European countries. There is a need in those countries to convert from brown coal for electricity production to less polluting sources of power, and I think that black coal will be a viable alternative. There is a continuing and increasing fear of nuclear technology in that part of the world because of the proximity of major cities and capitals to the site of the infamous Chernobyl nuclear disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of great interest to Australians is the desire of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to enter the European Community as soon as possible. As the honourable member for Warringah said, they will be seeking associate membership, and in future full membership. They hope to achieve full membership by the year 2000. When that occurs, there will be pressure on Western nations of the European Community to take central European agricultural produce, and hence there is an ever increasing need for the EC to reform the common agricultural policy. Welcome as the recent move to reduce production subsidies by 29 per cent was, there will be a need to further reform CAP as export from central European countries of agricultural products occurs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

I congratulate our leader, Senator Kerry Sibraa, President of the Senate, on the work that he did in leading the delegation. I thank Rob Alison, the Usher of the Black Rod, and Fred Peppinck and Julie Hatcher, advisers to the delegation, for their help during our visit. I found it an incredible experience to be in central eastern Europe at this time in its history and I would just like to comment, as other members have, on some of my impressions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first impression gained was the extreme optimism and the joy of most people in shaking off communism. As we all know, it is a terrible system and many people in those countries had suffered a great deal over many years at the hands of the communists. There was a slight feeling of fear too, in that they were not quite sure where they were going. They had this great optimism in the free market economy they were about to adopt, but they really were not quite sure where it was all going to lead them and had a slight fear that perhaps they might slip back. They certainly said they would not be slipping back into communism as it was known before, but nevertheless there was just this feeling there that they were a little concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found, having been into those countries that had suffered under communism, that communism does not mean equality for all. It means equality for the masses but, of course, some people are more equal than others. At the palaces of some of the leaders there, we talked to people in the situation where husband and wife and their parents and children were living in a one-bedroom complex, and we found out just exactly what communism meant to some of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay a tribute to the leaders of those countries, both church and secular, who have suffered so much but have brought their countries back into freedom. Previous speakers have spoken of Lech Walesa, an incredible person and character in his own right to speak to, who led the Solidarity movement in Poland, which I believe was the catalyst, if you like, that started the whole uprising throughout that part of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to His Holiness, Pope Paul II because, as a Polish Pope, he had a great deal to do, although not directly, with what has happened in Europe. Honourable members may have read the history of Poland. I have read Mitchener, which may not be a complete history of Poland but certainly whetted my appetite to go to that country. Situated where it is in Europe from the time history began, Poland has had its share of problems, of course, and it is wonderful to see it now with a great optimistic outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Czechoslovakia is an interesting country, consisting of 9.9 million Czechs and 5 million Slovaks. Hopefully, they have overcome their problems and that country will remain united.   As a previous honourable member said, it was interesting to be in that part of the world where they have such a heavy armament manufacturing plant. I think 70,000 people were employed at the plant until recently, many of whom are out of work now. When we put the argument about armaments to them, they said: `Well, we can produce one tank; we are sure we are going to sell it, particularly to the Middle East. We would need to produce 43 tractors to make the same profit. We are not sure we are going to sell those'. In practical terms, that is the problem they face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Bulgaria, 85 per cent of exports go to Comecon  and, of course, with its collapse, there is a major problem. Sixty-five per cent of its exports went to the Soviet Union, so with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Bulgarians had difficulty in deciding where to carry out their trade. Their unemployment, which they were concerned about, was to reach 10 per cent by the end of the year. It is amazing that this country just came out of being under the communist regime with a 10 per cent unemployment rate and ours is matching it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hungary would have been a front-line state if there had been a third world war with the West. The Hungarians would have been annihilated, some of the people told us, because they would have been a nuclear target. In all of Hungary's history there have only been a few years where there has been what you could call democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pollution of eastern Europe has been touched upon. We have to do a great deal to assist to overcome that problem. In Poland three-quarters of the forest has been damaged by acid rain, one-third of its rivers are polluted. A previous honourable member spoke about the nuclear reactors, which are a great problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, something that we should remember in this House is that the greatest enemy of the environment is poverty. We can see in eastern Europe just what poverty has done for the environment under a communist system. It is a lesson that we could all well learn. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to briefly comment in the time that is available about the opportunity that was afforded the parliamentary delegation to visit Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary. Indeed, having been to the Soviet Union the previous year, I found it interesting to draw comparisons between the places. The aspects of political dislocation, the ethnic tensions, the environmental difficulties and the economic woes of the former Soviet Union and in the countries that we visited were consistent. It was very interesting for us to have the opportunity to look closely at those difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am travelling to what was formerly East Germany later this year and it will be interesting to compare that country, which has been provided with the technological expertise and the capital to make the transformation perhaps much more rapidly, with some of the countries that we were able to visit. It will be interesting to see the comparison between the ways in which they are solving problems in former East Germany and the ways in which they are dealing with problems in the old Eastern Bloc. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks), mentioned the optimism of the people there. It was indeed gratifying, but when it came to their theoretical understanding of the capitalist system, while it may have been competent, there was some concern about the practical way in which they would put that philosophy into action. I believe this is the biggest problem that is faced by those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are in that region great opportunities for Australia. In Poland we ran into Australians who were organising a telecommunications structure for parts of that country. In Hungary we met officials from the Hawthorn Institute who were interested in developing training links between themselves, an American university and the Hungarian Government, so there are opportunities for Australians in that area. We met people who were selling coal and other things in Bulgaria. I believe that part of the role of delegations such as the one we were on, and indeed the Australian Government, must be to facilitate things for those very many Australians who are trading with that part of the world, who do have interests in that part of the world, and who through their ethnic background or through their contacts in business are busy developing an Australian presence in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my view and it remains my view that Australia, because of its size and its geographical position, will only ever be a spectator when we look at the developments in that part of the world, but there are significant niches where we have expertise and where our skill and ability or our products can make a mark on the market. It is important that Australia establish and develop trade links in those areas, and in many of the cities that we visited that was occurring. In Hungary we saw some facilitation occurring at a more rapid rate than in some of the other places, and I believe that needs to be developed and established even more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1992 seeks to amend section 299 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which deals with offences in relation to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Section 299 contains subparagraph (1)(d)(ii), which provides that a person shall not, by writing or speech, use words calculated to bring the Commission or a member of the Commission into disrepute. To contravene this subparagraph is an offence punishable upon conviction by a penalty, in the case of a natural person, of $500 or imprisonment for six months or both, and, in the case of a body corporate, of $1,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, if passed by this House and the Senate, will omit section 299(1)(d)(ii), thereby removing a provision in law giving the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and members of that Commission rights and powers and a form of protection not given to ordinary citizens, members of parliament or in fact Justices of the Federal Court. It is my view that the form of protection so provided in law is a denial of freedom of press and freedom of speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in this chamber today, those listening to this session of the House of Representatives and those ultimately reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of the first reading of this Bill might acknowledge that, if not successful, I am at least persistent. This is the third time that I introduce this Bill into this House, the first occasion being on 8 November 1990 and the second on 16 May 1991. I find it frustrating that on neither occasion did the Selection Committee see fit to give this Bill a second reading and disappointing that this Government has not been willing to support my Bill or introduce it as Government legislation to remove this iniquitous section of the Industrial Relations Act, this denial of our basic human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Government is not big on individual rights of its citizens.

The latter case was heard by the High Court of Australia, which has yet to bring down a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of this highly restrictive section of the Industrial Relations Act has been highly selective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992. I think people in Australia are very well aware of the forest industry and the extent of that industry throughout Australia. It is the second largest manufacturing industry in Australia. The Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) told us not so long ago here about how important this industry is to Australia. Indeed, it is. It is a very important industry if Australia is going to get on top of its export budgetary problems in the balance of payments. It is an industry in which at the moment we actually import about $2 billion worth of wood products into Australia. I am introducing this Bill because the previous Bill was not passed by Parliament. It is still very important that the forest industry be given the resource security that is necessary for investment to occur in the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill represents a hands-off approach by the Commonwealth and, unlike the recently defeated legislation, it does not extend Commonwealth control over State land use matters. The essence of this approach is for the Commonwealth to act only after an application for resource security is received from a State government. The Commonwealth would then assess whether the provisions of relevant Commonwealth Acts are fulfilled. If they are, then an instrument in writing is given which provides resource security to that applicant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for Federal resource security to be given to State or regional plans, major projects and wood processing projects, irrespective of the level of investment. Another provision in the Bill allows the Federal Government 12 months to undertake the various assessments as provided in the environmental and heritage Acts, and to raise any objections to the State sponsored plan or project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that time, the Commonwealth would agree not to use any of its powers to interfere in the agreement between the State and the forest industry in a particular area, unless there is a discovery of some previously unknown species and that continued forestry activities are considered to be a major threat to that species. In such a case, compensation will be made for the resources withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also requires that to avoid duplication the Commonwealth must, as far as practicable, coordinate and integrate the processes of assessment with the State. The Bill in no way diminishes the Commonwealth's decision making powers in respect of the environmental and heritage Acts which are presently in place, such as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only limitation that the Commonwealth has in the exercise of its decision making power is that it will have to be completed within 12 months. This legislation clearly defines the role of the Commonwealth and State governments, and minimises the grounds for withdrawal of resource security to the discovery of a new, or thought to be extinct, species. There is no monetary limit to the forest programs that would be eligible and all of Australia's 1,200 small sawmillers could be included, depending on the application coming forward from State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I present this Bill to the House and I hope that there is goodwill on the part of everybody in this Parliament to see some commonsense with regard to this industry. I would certainly welcome any additional comments for improvement to this Bill, as long as they are in line with the main objects of the Bill. I trust that, because of the Government's previous position on resource security, we get a bipartisan approach to this very important legislation before the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)expresses its support for the APPM workers at Burnie, Tasmania, in their struggle to be collectively represented by their unions in negotiations with the company;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)opposes the attack by APPM on the whole trade union movement inherent in the writs issued against the President of the ACTU, Mr Martin Ferguson, and other officials and unions for organising stop-work meetings of APPM employees; and</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)right of workers to be collectively represented by their unions in negotiations with the company.</PARA>
<PARA>As I speak today, I am uncertain as to how events in Burnie in Tasmania will transpire. I understand that this morning there were two arrests and that the company is determined to break picket lines. I understand also that there is a substantially strong picket representing a fierce determination on the part of most workers to resist the very unhelpful and determined attitude of the company to prevent workers having the opportunity to be represented by their unions, and that later today the hypothetical fears expressed the other day by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, unfortunately may come to reality. We all hope that that is not the case. I am sure that all honourable members of this House, irrespective of their views on the rights or wrongs of this dispute, will join me in expressing that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Burnie today is a town that is being torn apart, a town divided. The company has issued notices dismissing 850 of its workers and, of those, some 30 are seeking to return to work. The police are being drawn into this dispute, through legal actions instituted by the company. The company has hired significant teams of private security guards, who are terrorising those on the picket lines and also journalists who are on the scene. That contrasts with the circumstances that prevail in another paper mill in southern Tasmania, ANM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see the contrast between the two approaches. APPM has resorted to the tactics of fear where, in the view of its industrial relations leader, Mr Herbert Larratt, workers should go to work every day expecting to be dismissed. It is a culture dominated by fear and intimidation. Contrast that with the circumstances in southern Tasmania at ANM, where the company&mdash;with its work force and the unions working collectively&mdash;is in fact celebrating remarkable gains in productivity, and has been selected by the Australian Manufacturing Council, from Australia-wide competition, for an award of best practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, everything that is happening at APPM represents the `how not to'. It represents a retreat to the black days of confrontation, the days when workers came to work out of motivations of fear rather than of commitment to the shared goals of the company. It is a very sad day for Australia. Not only does it represent&mdash;and this is the important point that I think this House should reflect on&mdash;the failure of the management of the mill to come to terms with modern management and to seek to impose an engineering solution to a complex human and industrial relations circumstance, but also it reflects what will be everywhere in this country, in every State, in every town, if the Opposition introduces its policy. There is no doubt that the approach that is being implemented by APPM reflects precisely that which is advocated by the Opposition. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 21 May, in a leading article by Shaun Carney, makes this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been fascinating on several occasions during the past few months watching Dr Hewson pouring petrol on the fire of hard-line deregulationist policy. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change that appears likely to result from Dr Hewson's energies is that Mr Howard's regime of workers and employees being able to "opt out" of the centrally-determined award system will be reversed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the expiry of awards and agreements, employers and workers will be considered out of the system and they will both have to decide to "opt in" if they want to be covered by industrial tribunals. Regardless of whether the policy is viewed as desirable or not, it is clearly a calculated attempt to dismember Australian unionism.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Carney continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the analysis of the nascent policy has concentrated on what it would mean for workers, what entitlements they would lose. There has been less attention paid to what the more-radical policy would mean for employers. Employers would not lose much at all. In fact, they would do very well. The power of individual employers will grow as an inverse function of the workers' loss of negotiating power. With their hire-and-fire powers enhanced, and various existing entitlements absorbed into total wage levels, it will be the employers who will be making demands of their employees. Without a central tribunal, there will not&mdash;there cannot&mdash;be any protection for employees.</PARA>
<PARA>The only way that commonsense can prevail in this dispute, as has been called for by the Tasmanian Premier, by Commonwealth Ministers, and by many honourable members of this House, is for those who are not now locked into a position of confrontation in the company to take some wiser counsel from those who are offering the possibility of sitting down and recognising the rights of unions to represent workers&mdash;as the workers in Tasmania so plainly do desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we need to look at whether or not those institutional investors in the company&mdash;and there are significant institutional investments held by groups such as AMP&mdash;are prepared to continue to have passive investment in a company which is so obviously working on the sharp edge of implementing a challenge to the arbitration system and a challenge to the legal entitlements of workers to be represented by their trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there needs to be serious consideration by eminent Australians such as Sir James Balderstone and others who are the controllers of significant institutional investments in APPM. Their interests are going to be dramatically affected as this dispute proceeds, if it does&mdash;and one cannot see a resolution of it emerging, at least in the short time, unless some hard heads are brought to bear in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be considered that Sir James Balderstone and other institutional investors will start to see, firstly, their cash flow dry up as those paper stocks run out, even though they were built up before the dispute. Secondly, there needs to be consideration by those institutional investors of whether or not they want to be seen as co-sponsors of this aggressive and contemptuous attack by the company on its workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to make one brief comment about the politics of this. We have seen both the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the industrial relations spokesman involved in private discussions with the company at least two or three weeks ago, plainly in circumstances where they were misleading this House about their lack of involvement and urging others to stay out. We see the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) joining in the anti-union attack, but fortunately his colleagues and the Tasmanian Liberals are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always politics first with the honourable member for Braddon. I copped a serve the other day for not supporting resource security. What an irony. In fact, the only Tasmanian in this House who expressed considerable doubts and reluctance about some of the contents of the legislation nonetheless supported it as a good compromise. The only such person in this House who voted for it was me. Not one Tasmanian Liberal on the other side voted for it and yet they have the cheek to criticise at this point of time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second time this week that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has given us the opportunity to consider the union-APPM dispute in Tasmania. As the local member for that area, I welcome that opportunity. I welcome that opportunity so that some of the facts and the figures and the situations can be brought before the people. First of all, I want to refute totally and utterly one comment made by the honourable member, and that was that I have taken a position which is totally opposed to the union movement. I have not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, as does the coalition, that the union movement has a role to play in industrial matters. But that role has to be determined by the members, the men and women on any work site. They should have a choice as to whether a union represents them or whether some of them might prefer a solicitor to represent them in their negotiations with their employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No longer should Australian workers, men and women, be forced to join unions. No longer in this country can that continue. I believe unions have a future in Australia, but there must not be a monopolistic position. I am pleased that APPM has now done away with the no ticket, no work rule. That went by the board six weeks ago. That is very important. Freedom of association is what we should have, even in industrial issues in Australia. The first part of this motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . expresses its support for APPM workers at Burnie. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I express my support for APPM workers at Burnie and I must say that there are very few people in the Labor Party, certainly not the honourable member who has proposed this motion, from my understanding of his background, who would really have very much empathy with or understanding of what it means to be a genuine manual worker, as a lot of these people are&mdash;to get grease in his hair or dirt under his fingernails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do understand that. I know what it means. I know what it means to go into the forests and to use a chainsaw and to use logging skidders and so forth. I know what it is to have breakdowns in machinery and to have to fix them&mdash;to get in underneath them, to try to get things going&mdash;so that bread can be on the table of the family. I understand those things. I have done a lot of manual work myself. I understand it and I understand the workers' plight here. It is for that very reason that I am in Parliament here&mdash;so that these workers can have a freedom of association, so that they can have the freedom to choose whom they belong to. It is a very fundamental principle in Australia that has to be upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also talked about intimidation. Where is the intimidation occurring? I can say to honourable members that I have had dozens and dozens of phone calls from workers at the mill who want to go to work. These workers are getting phone calls from other people telling them, `I hope you have insurance on your house; I hope you have a good private medical insurance' and so on. Many of the workers have had to have their telephone numbers changed so that they are not rung up in the middle of the night and intimidated. One person, in particular, was out doing some fencing work and for the third time was approached by union people and told, `The next time I come back, I will break your legs'. This is what is going on. There is a lot of intimidation, and union secretaries ought to be able to stop a lot of it. That is their responsibility&mdash;to exercise control over their members in this situation. The situation is disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me bring everybody up to date and explain why the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) is so conciliatory today as compared with two days ago. Mr Justice Wright and his comments in the Supreme Court yesterday in Tasmania, contrary to the abbreviated form of his comments given to us by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which led to the expulsion from this House of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), have been reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The picketers were entitled to make a protest against a perceived injustice or violation of their rights in a peaceful and orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Once their conduct ceases to have that character, police intervention is called for and should be expected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said he believed neither Commissioner Johnson nor his officers would in future fail to apply the law at the Burnie Mill site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If police did not act, and APPM made a fresh application to the court, he could well issue an order forcing police to intervene.</PARA>
<PARA>The court ruled that police must take action against picketers who block individuals and vehicles from entering and leaving the mill. That is their right: picketers should be able to picket. But the men and women who want to work should also have the right to go to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr): why can people in a free democracy in Australia not have the right to go to work when work is provided by their employer? Why not? That is what this issue is really about. There are at least 300 employees down there in Burnie who want to go to work, and I suspect that if those 300 went through and there was not the intimidation on the picket lines to go through the gates, we would have probably 400 to 500 people going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the right of people to strike and to demonstrate on the issues, but I also support the right and the freedom of people to go to work. The details of this dispute are that the company, back on 3 March, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The award remains. Twenty five per cent over award payments remain; 9 per cent superannuation paid by the company remains; redundancy of three weeks for one year's work remains and it is a 35-hour week and the average income of the men is $41,000. It ranges from $22,000 to $77,000. The average income is $41,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the company said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Restrictive work practices are cancelled.</PARA>
<PARA>This refers to practices such as not being able to read papers while on the job. That has now been cancelled. It refers to practices such as abusing the taxi service provided by the company. That has now been cancelled. Practices such as being called in for half an hour's or an hour's work and getting nine hours pay have now been cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is going to be competitive&mdash;and the Government wants us to be a smart country, a clever country&mdash;we are not going to be clever if we keep those work practices. This company is faced with reduced tariffs; it has got to be competitive; we all want Australian companies to be competitive. There is no doubt that it can be competitive. It is in an industry in which we need to replace the importation of pulp and of timber products into this country and, rather than being difficult in this area, the Government ought to be supporting the right of workers to go to work if that company has work to provide for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning, this is a great opportunity to discuss these sorts of issues, and the Opposition is not opposed to unions representing workers who choose the unions to represent them. But they should no longer be forced into that situation. The days of monopolistic power over representing workers at any individual work site in Australia or in an industry, I would hope, are over. If this dispute achieves that, then it will be a great step forward for the freedom of workers in this country. I believe that, far from conditions being worse, if we change and have a much more flexible industrial relations system in this country, the workers will be better off. This dispute has occurred under this Government's industrial relations system, not under ours; we are not in Government. </PARA>

That is why members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), are squealing like stuck pigs both in this House and outside this chamber, and why they are complaining about what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are complaining about the fact that the Government has exposed the lies, the deceit and the hypocrisy that have been mentioned in this place by certain honourable members about this dispute. They know that the workers of this country are now really going to find out what an industrial relations policy under the coalition means. It means confrontation; it means fights; it means attempts to destroy unions; and it means attempts to take away all the basic industrial rights that workers have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the honourable member for Braddon has no support from his colleagues in Tasmania because they do not want to be sold a dump as he has. That is the essence of this dispute and that is the essence of the Opposition's position in this case. It is trying desperately to hide the fact that it is involved. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) clearly exposing the fact that the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition's industrial relations spokesperson, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;despite their protestations about, `Keep politicians out of this dispute; let's not have any politicians involving them selves in this dispute'&mdash;have their fingers fully in the pie. But are they actually trying to solve the dispute? Are they trying to bring some sense into it? No. All they are about is encouraging the company to rip it right up the workers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not supporting any sort of intimidation, but let us look at who started the intimidation. How did this dispute start? It started by APPM sacking workers. It started by APPM issuing edicts saying, `From now on thou shalt not do this and thou shalt not do that'. There was no discussion, no consultation, no sitting down with workers and saying, `Listen, we have some problems here. Our profitability is suffering and our efficiency is suffering.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what most of the other companies in this country have been doing for the last five years. That is why we have had such massive efficiency and productivity improvements. Companies have sat down and talked with their workers. They have listened to their workers and worked out new processes and efficiency programs. But does APPM do that? No. What APPM does is issue an edict and stick it on the noticeboard. It says, `You shall not do this. You shall not do that. We are going to sack this person and we are going to sack that person. We are going to get rid of workers from the boiler room and we are going to put management in there and train them. We are going to threaten the safety of this plant.

So if we are going to start talking about intimidation, let us start talking about all the intimidation that has been occurring here. Let us start talking about the provocation that the company brought into this dispute right from the start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one starts looking at what has been happening in industrial relations for the last five years, one sees that a lot of very sensible negotiations have occurred in companies around this country. Of course there have been some problems with efficiency and work practices in many companies. That is why we had the problem of our export performance and that is why we were not able to achieve what we needed to achieve in this country in getting a competitive edge for our goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Government tackled the problem. It started the process of award restructuring. It said to unions and management alike that we have to tackle this issue and that the way to tackle it is to sit down, look at all those practices, put everything on the table and negotiate new agreements and new awards. It did not say it would scrap them all per se and start a new system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It started the process by sitting down and talking with both sides and working out what should happen, and that is what should have happened in this dispute. We would not have had a dispute if that had happened. If APPM had gone to the unions twelve months or two years ago and said, `Look, look at our profitability situation, look at our efficiency, we need to tackle this. Let us sit down and work it out. Let us sit down and think about what we need to do', if they had started the process of real, sensible negotiations, then this dispute would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the APPM management is locked into the old disputes of the 1950s. They think they are the bosses; they know all the answers; they do not need to talk to workers; they do not need to find out what workers think about the issue, even though it is probably the workers that know how to run the plant much better than the management&mdash;something that has been exposed in most of the discussions we have had with unions for the last five years. When we actually start talking to workers on the site about how plants should operate, we get a whole lot of new ideas about how to make things more efficient. The workers actually understand the way these things operate and they know how to try to improve the efficiencies of plants. If the management had done that right from the start, we would not have had any of this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The APPM management cannot appreciate that. Their view is: we are the bosses, we issue edicts, we chop all these things out and if the workers do not like it, they can get out. We will lock them out, we will bring the security dogs in, we will bring the guards in. We own this plant and we will run it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen what happens with that type of process. The whole plant has been closed down and we now have this incredible confrontation building up because the management just will not budge, they will not negotiate. We had yesterday the situation where we were talking about what happened with the decision that was brought down by the Industrial Relations Commission. There was a negotiated position, but it broke down because the management refused to consider that they should not proceed with their writs and not proceed with all their other court actions. Then the unions are attacked because they will not bow down and say, `Okay, we will agree, we will go back to work, but the management is fine, they can still issue all the writs against our unions'. </PARA>

It is allowed to continue with its writs and all its court actions, but the union has to just go back to work and agree with whatever the management has to say. Then the unions are accused by the Opposition of being the foul players in this game. Again, we have the situation where it is the APPM management that has been proven to be wrong. The reason why the Opposition is so upset, as I said earlier, is that its industrial relations agenda for this country has been so badly exposed in this dispute and it is sending a signal to workers throughout the country that this is the fate that awaits them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has finally injected a bit of life into this debate. It seems that the fire has gone out of the belly of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who came into this place yesterday with a bit of ranting and raving. I think the honourable member for Denison knows the reality of what is happening in Burnie. He knows that this motion before this House is nothing but a bit of nonsense, so he has well and truly quietened down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moreton is an interesting character, a Queensland left wing Volvo socialist, a teacher who proposes to tell us how to run grass roots industrial relations policy at a pulp and paper mill in Tasmania with a Sieg Heil mentality that would take us back truly to the confrontationist days when we marched in the streets. Very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the first clause of this motion. The honourable member for Denison says that this House should express its support for the APPM workers at Burnie. I agree with that. I support the workers at Burnie. I support the workers all over Australia. I am a worker. I have been a worker. I will always be a worker. I support the workers and I also support the company. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) defined this issue rather well the other night in this House when he said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When one looks at the policies of the Opposition, one can understand why it does not like terms like mate.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) interjected and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They hate mates.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Hinkler replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exactly; they hate the average Aussie worker.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the biggest heap of nonsense that I have heard anyone in this House support. This side of the House supports the workers and supports workers' rights, which is why we are here today to defend the right of the workers to an environment in which they can work peacefully, in which they have the right not to be dominated by a Sieg Heil mentality by shop stewards or union leaders, but in which they have the right to make decisions freely by themselves, uncoerced, in an atmosphere of cooperation in order to keep their jobs and in order to run efficient industry policy in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the company, as well as the workers. I support the company's right to conduct its business in an atmosphere which allows it to get on with the job without outside coercion. It is the outside influences, surely, that have driven this dispute from the very beginning. Honourable members, without viable, productive enterprises in this nation we are going to have no jobs, no work. Our national debt will grow and grow, and before long we will not have a nation any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This dispute, it seems to me, is about freedom of choice. But the parties to this dispute are constrained by our highly legalistic, regulated and centralised system of industrial relations. This dispute actually grew out of New South Wales, moved itself into Tasmania, and months later we have a real ding-dong battle between unions and management&mdash;but not necessarily between workers and management. We have tried time and time again to make it perfectly clear that the system which spawned this dispute is not our preferred option. It is not the way that we would like to see the industrial relations system managed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made over and over again that the dispute has occurred within the legalistic system, within the regulated system. It is about time that company managements and company workers throughout Australia had freedom of choice to choose to do their own thing without being told by the union bosses, or indeed by the bosses of employer organisations, how to run their businesses. Yesterday in this House during Question Time, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not mind the Leader of the Opposition calling me a creep. This person and the honourable member for Bennelong wilfully connived in the prolongation of an industrial dispute for their own political purposes against the interests of the people of Tasmania, and the people of Burnie in particular.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a bit of nonsense too, because it is the Rambo tactics of Senator Cook which have exacerbated this dispute. Mr Martin Ferguson, President of the ACTU, decided to do a Bob Hawke. He was going to go down to Burnie and in a grand manner solve the dispute and bring it back on a plate to the people of Australia, to show that once again the trade union bureaucracy, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was able to deliver a positive result to the people. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) is the local member, and he has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Burnie Mill dispute is now a dispute over monopolistic union power. It's not about safety, the award or dropping charges against mill employees.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the honourable member for Braddon is absolutely right. A lot of what this dispute is about is the issue of no ticket, no start. Until six weeks ago, this mill in Burnie had been a no ticket, no start mill, with compulsory union membership, and union dues automatically deducted from its employees by the company on behalf of the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and others on this side of the House particularly support the concept of voluntary union membership, of voluntary membership of organisations of all kinds, because a society which is supposed to be a democratic, free society ought to give people freedom of choice. In that context, this motion today by the honourable member for Denison assumes that one side of the equation&mdash;the unions&mdash;is outside the law. It assumes what in practice is true and has been true for decades and decades, because the Industrial Relations Act recognises the power of the Industrial Relations Commission and gives it both responsibilities and rights to settle disputes but gives it no power over the unions. It gives it heaps of power over the companies but no powers over the union. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)deplores the Government's appalling record on road funding, noting that road funding has steadily decreased in real terms while the Government expects to collect more than double the revenue from diesel and fuel excise in 1991-92 than it did in 1982-83; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)recognises that money raised by road user charges should be directed to roads.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's track record on the important issue of road funding is appalling. Funding for main roads has fallen almost 30 per cent in per capita terms&mdash;in real terms as well&mdash;over the past seven years. Australian national road funds, which were $1.5 billion in 1990-91, have been reduced by 25 per cent in real terms since 1983-84, when the Hawke Government came to power, due to the non-indexing of funds, whereas fuel excises increased from $1.8 billion to close to $5 billion over the same period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a table here. I wish everyone could see it because it shows in the most obvious terms that huge gap. That is what this debate is really about&mdash;the huge gap between excise collections, which have absolutely skyrocketed since 1984-85, and road funding. The road funding trend line is almost flat while the excise collections trend line goes sky high in those particular years. This is what this debate is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When fuel excise was introduced in 1975, close to three-quarters of it was allocated to road funding and yet in 1991-92 only one-fifth of excise revenue was allocated to road funding. That is what we are talking about here this morning&mdash;the fact that in 1975-76 only 2c out of the 5c collected from fuel excise actually went to areas other than road funding. Today we have a fuel excise of almost 26c per litre. Of that, almost 20c&mdash;that is, four-fifths of what is collected&mdash;goes to areas other than road funding. In fact, only 6c out of that almost 26c per litre actually goes to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the crux of this debate. I challenge the other members of the Government who will speak in this debate to refute what I have said. There is indisputable evidence that since this Government came to power it has continued to milk road users as a source of funds while roads in many parts of the country remain in a very sorry state of disrepair. The places which have suffered the most have been the fastest growing areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of McPherson certainly falls within that category. The Gold Coast region is recognised as one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. We have there a rapid increase in tourist numbers and a rapid increase in through traffic going from New South Wales to Brisbane. We now see the amount spent on the arterial roads system&mdash;the Pacific Highway and the other main roads&mdash;falling well short of the needs and demands of the motoring public who use those roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could point to many instances of road conditions being totally inadequate between the Gold Coast city area and the Albert Shire. In fact, they are deplorable. In one two-kilometre stretch of the Pacific Highway that goes through Nerang, the main arterial route from New South Wales through to Brisbane, there are three sets of traffic lights. These are at crossings of the Pacific Highway and all within two kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this day and age, that is absolutely outrageous and yet we are told by the local authorities that the Federal Government is not prepared to guarantee the funding for the building of the necessary interchanges there for at least five years. To the local authorities and to the Albert Shire Council in particular, this is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure we will hear from the Government some way of getting around this by fiddling with the figures. I challenge it when it does that to address the issues. There are complexities when it comes to comparing different levels of road funding. At the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference it was decided that Federal funds for local roads would be absorbed into local government general revenue assistance. At roughly the same time the Commonwealth effectively abolished the State arterial roads category of funding and reallocated funds from that category to other funding categories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the abolition of that category all Commonwealth funds have been directed into specific projects deemed to be&mdash;and here we have it again, the great socialist approach to doing things&mdash;of not only economic importance but also social importance. Of course, these changes by the Government over the last couple of years have effectively muddied the waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One fact that is plainly obvious&mdash;and I challenge Government members to address it when they join in this debate&mdash;is that the Government is using road users as a source of general revenue. We deplore that. I pointed to the figures. I challenge Government members, when they speak, to explain to those members of the Australian public who are listening to this debate today and who are in the Parliament why that is occurring and why, over the past seven or eight years, the Government has directed money from fuel excise into general revenue at an alarming rate. That is a challenge that I hold out to those opposite today. The people who are caught in traffic jams on the Pacific Highway, on their way home to Brisbane from a weekend at the Gold Coast, are currently paying through the nose and they are receiving little benefit for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also of great concern to me, of course, is the fact that many people who live on parts of the Gold Coast and work in Brisbane, simply because they have to work there, have to travel up and back on that road each day; and they are put at greater risk as they commute because of the shocking state of that road. I could go into great detail about the deplorable state of the roads all over the Gold Coast region. Both the Gold Coast City Council and the Albert Shire Council are extremely concerned about their capacity, because of this reduction in Federal Government funding that has occurred over the years, to even cope with the sorts of traffic projections that we are looking at over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982-83&mdash;the Hawke Government succeeded the Fraser Government towards the end of that period&mdash;road funding levels actually received an unprecedented boost with the Fraser Government's bicentennial funding initiative. This period&mdash;the 1982-83 period&mdash;actually represented the peak of road funding levels in this country, and those levels have not been maintained. That is the other complaint that we have got. That is the other little bit of evidence that we want refuted by the Government. The fact is that the Government has not maintained road funding at those levels. </PARA>

Our user pays approach to road funding will ensure that all revenue raised by user charges is spent on road maintenance and construction. We will abolish fuel excise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will immediately take up the challenge issued by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), and it really is a blast from the past. I think I have spoken in about two or three of these road funding debates put up by Opposition members, and it certainly is a pet subject for them. It is a very important subject; I certainly do not deny that. The reality is that they never want to compare apples with apples when they start doing these comparisons of how many cents in the litre is coming out of fuel excise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they never say, of course, is that the arrangement in terms of the collection of fuel excise has changed very significantly over the life of the Government. Because of those changes, it is quite misleading to compare figures in the last years of the Fraser Government with current figures. The most fundamental one was in 1986 with the introduction of a resource rental tax on petroleum. The reality is that, if one compares the actual average dollars spent on roads over the life of the Fraser Government with the average dollars spent by the Hawke and Keating governments on roads, one sees that the spending of the current Government is something like 22 per cent higher in real terms than that of the Fraser Government. So let us not have this nonsense about trying to compare how many cents in the litre from the fuel excise or how much of the resource rental tax goes into roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition also have no comprehension at all of the excise position on petrol. There are two components of the excise on petroleum in Australia. One is a resource rental tax and the other is the actual fuel excise. What Opposition members do is lump the two together and say, `This is the total figure and this is how much is being spent on roads: it is a very small proportion of this total figure'. Of course, what they do not ever say is that the resource rental tax is in effect a super profit tax and that, if that tax was not charged on the petrol companies, it would not mean any reduction in the actual price of petrol; what it would mean would be higher profits for the companies and less revenue coming to the people of Australia. It is a fair comparison to look at the cents per litre coming out of the actual fuel excise and not to lump the two charges together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson did not do that in his comparison and he also did not mention the basic fact that the current Government's average spending on roads is something like 22 per cent higher in real terms than the Fraser Government's. This year alone, the Government will spend $1.6 billion on roads. That is simply earmarked for roads. That does not take into account the funding which then goes in untied grants both to the States and to local government, both of whom are major players in the construction of roads in Australia. The Federal Government does not build any roads in Australia. All roads constructed out of Federal funds are constructed either by local councils or, if they are national highways, by State main roads departments on contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson made great play about the position of local councils and how they were telling him they were having difficulty with road funding. I spent two terms on the Pine Rivers Shire Council immediately before my election here. I served on that council's works committee and I was involved for six years with that council's road building program. I think it is the sixth or seventh largest council in Queensland. Like councils in the electorate of McPherson, it deals with a part of the south-east corner of Queensland that is urbanising very fast. I am only too familiar with the demands on local government caused by having to build new infrastructure, new roads, to meet population increases. But the reality is that councils are largely the masters of their own destiny. I do not have the figures exactly but the two Gold Coast councils to which the honourable member referred would receive in untied grants something like $1.5m a year from the Commonwealth Government. It might even be a bit higher than that, but those certainly would be the figures of similar councils on the north side of Brisbane. Those councils can decide what they spend. They can spend that whole $1.5m supplementing their road program if they think it is a high enough priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gold Coast City Council is probably very fond of its cultural facilities, and I do not knock it for that. It has got lovely cultural facilities and first rate council chambers. I have no idea what the Albert Shire spent on that huge complex people see as they drive down the old south coast highway. But if those councils think that road building is the No. 1 priority, that is their decision. They are elected representatives; they have their own budgets; and they must determine where they spend their money. What the Commonwealth is doing is saying, `We respect you as elected representatives. We will not be tying your funding into particular earmarked categories. We will make more and more of your funding untied so that you can respond to your own community demands'. That is a sensible move which local government very much welcomes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McPherson says that it is muddying the water to say that these things are no longer earmarked but combined in pooled funds. I imagine that if he went and told his two councils, which he is very fond of, that this is muddying the water he would get a very stark response. I know that is what he would get from the local government areas in my electorate, because they are very keen on these sorts of changes which give them more responsibility for their own destiny. They can make their own decisions about where they spend their money. If their No. 1 demand in the area is road building, then they can allocate a large part or all of that money to road building. If their No. 1 demand is to improve the water system or the sewerage system or to get more parks and gardens, then they can spend it on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, after the honourable member's huffing and puffing about not enough money being spent on roads, I challenged him to say what the Opposition is going to do about it. One of his party's hallmarks, one of its main planks for going to the Australian people, is that it is going to knock about $10 billion off government spending. I think that equates to about a $4 billion net reduction in government spending. His party's other great platform is that it is going to knock out all the excises&mdash;the resource rental tax and the excise on petrol&mdash;and impose a single goods and services tax of 15 per cent. According to honourable members opposite, this will lead to a great reduction in the cost of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am like every other motorist. If I thought the price of petrol was going to be reduced, that would obviously appeal to me. It would appeal to everyone. That is why honourable members opposite are proposing it. But I say to them, `Please do not come in here proposing that you are going to actually cut government spending, that you are going to reduce the amount of money coming from the excise, and then pretend through some sort of magical three-card trick that you can do it all'. The Opposition is saying, `People can pay less. We are going to cut what government does. Petrol prices are going to go down. But we are going to build more roads as well'. This is great stuff! It is all done with mirrors. People are supposed to be distracted by looking up at a shining light and not realising what is happening around the back with the hands in the pocket, grabbing it in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that honourable members opposite say is, `We believe in road user charges'. What does that mean? Of course, we have not had spelt out what they actually mean by road user charges. Do they mean some sort of extra charge on petrol? One assumes not, because they say they are not going to do that. Do they mean some sort of massive increase in registrations? They are very silent about that one. We have not had the answer to that. All we have heard them say is that there is going to be a transport commission which will do an assessment of what it actually costs to build and maintain roads in Australia. Consistent with the philosophy of the entire Fightback proposals and consistent with Liberal philosophy, user pays means that road users will have to pay the total cost of maintaining and building roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite do not say how that is going to happen. If they are not going to do it through the petroleum excise, they will have to do it through registrations or some other new charge or scheme that they will have to devise. I ask them not to try to con people by saying, `The price of petrol is going to go down. We are still going to build all these roads. But somehow, magically, you do not have to pay for it'. People do have to pay for it. They understand that. They also know that there are many complicated issues involved in these things. They are not simple, straightforward questions, as the honourable member makes out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is looked at objectively and fairly, the record of the Government on road funding is good. We would all like to see more money spent on roads, but it is a good record. It is much superior to that of the previous conservative Government. At least there is a basically sensible, straightforward and open policy and none of that nonsense about saying, `We will not actually tell you where we are going to get the road user charges. We will not tell you about registrations. We will not tell you about any other thing we are going to dream up until we get there. Then we will sit down with this magic pudding of paying people less'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this motion of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I say first of all, in answer to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), let us have a look at the Federal Government road funding program since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983-84 the amount spent on roads by the Federal Government was $1.75 billion; in 1989-90 it was $1.37 billion, a drop of $0.38 billion. I do not know how we can come to the conclusion that there has been an increase in expenditure. If we go through the years, we see that, in 1984-85, it was down 1.3 per cent; in 1985-86, down 6.1 per cent; in 1986-87, down 4 per cent; in 1987-88, down 5 per cent; in 1988-89, down 6.2 per cent; in 1989-90, down 1.2 per cent. Road user payments to the Federal Government and petrol excise in 1982-83 were $1.08 billion and in 1989-90 they were $5.08 billion. In fact, the Federal Government is ripping off the people of Australia by $2.5 billion which it is not putting into roads. That is a conservative estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Fisher ranting and raving about the Fightback package, which he obviously knows very little about. One thing I can guarantee him is that anything a coalition government does will be paid for, cash up front. There will be none of this nonsense of putting this nation further and further into debt. In the Fightback package everything is costed across the board. The people of Australia will be getting what they paid for, but they will be paying for what they get. Let us have none of this nonsense that the Government is doing this, that and the other; most of it is on borrowed money. Any fool can create jobs and build something when he is borrowing money. We see it all the time. I think that argument is fallacious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I am speaking here today is because I am a little concerned. I was very excited when the One Nation package came out; of course, it is now called the `Ruination' package. One paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key objective of this Government is to rationalise the role of each level of government to remove overlapping and therefore confusing responsibilities. In this context the addition of routes based on the existing Sturt (Sydney-Adelaide) and Newell (Melbourne-Brisbane) highways represents a logical extension of the inter-capital NHS.</PARA>
<PARA>I read that, re-read it and re-read it. It is a bit of gobbledegook because when honourable members read it they will see that it says neither one thing nor another. It suggests that those roads might be good as part of the national highway system; it builds up people's hopes. It has done this in my electorate but, of course, after a lot of research it has let people down. I have been telling people in my electorate, `Yes, the Government is going to spend all this money on the Newell and Sturt highways. Isn't that wonderful?'. But as I make some investigations, some of these people are a bit like the Phantom; it is a bit like the Qantas-Australian airline deal, the pay TV and the technical college fiasco of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Certainly, I agree with some of the issues but it seems there is a change in policy every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a grab bag. I think the Prime Minister, in trying to get the One Nation package together, phoned around the various State road departments and said, `What would be a good idea?'. It was not thoroughly researched and now we find that all these people who have had their hopes built up are going to have them dashed. I hope I am wrong but it is not looking good. I would like to apologise to the Narrandera Shire Council and to the Hay Shire Council because I have been telling them, `Yes, certainly, the Federal Government is going to spend a lot of money on those roads'. What they are concerned about, of course, is that it is now looking as if those routes will not be the main Brisbane to Melbourne and Sydney to Adelaide routes. It may be that they may change those routes. We do not know. There is nothing in the One Nation program about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand other local government areas saying to the government&mdash;both State and Federal&mdash;`We want to change the route of the highway. We want to make this the national highway, to make this the State highway', because of the atrocious conditions of the roads in New South Wales. I am not blaming the New South Wales Government because continually the cutbacks to the State Government of New South Wales via the Federal Government are horrendous. Of course, in New South Wales we have the 3 x 3 program with the State Government trying to do something about roads. Of course, in this recession that we did not have to have, the money is just not available. So it is battling on, in the best way it can, to try to do something with the road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Riverina-Darling in western New South Wales, where I live, I must say&mdash;not in any way in the form of a brag, because I do not consider driving on our road system to be any great form of pleasure&mdash;that this year I will probably clock up my one millionth kilometre since I became the member for Riverina and then Riverina-Darling. So I think I know a little bit about the road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the roads I would like to talk about is the Cobb Highway, the road that extends from Wilcannia right down through to Hay. The Cobb Highway, particularly between Ivanhoe and Hay is notorious. Over the past few years I would say that the closure rate would be about 10 per cent of the year. A couple of years ago it was closed for 80 days. In Ivanhoe, which is a small community in western New South Wales, when that road is cut the people have no way of getting out of town to go to the south to get to civilisation for whatever reason they may want to leave. Certainly, getting goods and products into the area and produce out is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Cobb Highway action committee was formed some years ago and they made representations to the State Government. I am pleased to say that something is being done there but of course it is very slow because of this lack of funding. It is sealed 43 kilometres south of Ivanhoe and it is hoped that over the next several years that that road will be completely sealed. It is interesting that the new technology has come into play there and the Government is trying a geotextile mat on a normal clay surface. Rather than have to try to get those gravels from that area, which are very scare and which add to the cost of the road, by using geotextile they have been able to reduce the cost by about 40 per cent. It is hoped that in 1992-93 another seven kilometres of the road will be done and that eight kilometres a year will be done after 1992-93, so there is good work going on there. I would like to congratulate Helen Rogers, who is the chairman of that organisation, for the great work that she has done. I would also like to thank Jim Small the State member for Murray, Adrian Cruickshank, who is the member for Murrumbidgee, and Mick Beckworth, the President of the Hay Shire. Time does not permit me to speak about all of the roads in my electorate but heaven knows most of the them need some work&mdash;</PARA>

I would like to speak about the Kidman Highway, from Hillston to Cobar and through to Bourke in Queensland. It is a road which a number of people in that area would like to see sealed. It is a horrendous road, a dangerous road, and it also has a lot of heavy traffic on it. Another road, of course, is the Rankin Springs to Lake Cargelligo road. The Carrathool Shire, the Bland Shire and the Lachlan Shire are to be congratulated on the work that they are doing there. I believe that road is one of the most dangerous in my electorate; it is like driving on marbles. It is great to see some of it being sealed but I would like to see a lot more money spent on these roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay a tribute to those workers of the Road and Traffic Authority in New South Wales. It is presently undergoing a great deal of restructuring which makes it very difficult for those workers, particularly in outback areas because they are worried about their jobs. Obviously, all governments have had to tighten their belt in this recession and it is probably right that economies have been made where possible. But I think we have to remember that these men, and also the women who work in the offices, are a substantial part of these communities. It is very difficult for these people in this time as they are worried about their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a lot of this could be overcome, particularly in the areas that I am speaking about, if the Federal Government would increase its expenditure. I know that things are tough and I know that we cannot keep on living on borrowed money; we have to have cash in hand. The honourable member for Fisher spoke about the local councils and he said that they can make decisions about where they spend their money, but there are so many other necessities of life. I think that local government is also going through a fairly rough period at this stage, as are most areas of administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the amount of money going into roads because I know how important roads are, not only for the good of the community, as far as our economy goes, but also for the social fabric of our community. We are a large nation. I see that some people were criticising the coalition's Fightback package for reducing the price of fuel because it would add to the greenhouse gas emissions. I would like those people to go out and live at Wilcannia or Bourke or Broken Hill, and those places, where we have to pay additional costs on every item that comes into the area because of the tyranny of distance, as we call it here in Australia. I am sure that the benefits to be gained by reducing the price of fuel for these people would far outweigh any problem that might be faced by greenhouse gas emissions from the use of vehicles in those areas. Certainly in cities we might be able to do something but I think that is another argument. We have to do something about preventing the growth of these huge cities at the expense of those people who want to live in outback area and who want to provide a better quality of life for their families and for themselves. </PARA>

But the honourable member for McPherson comes up with all sorts of things and says `Oh well, it is very complex'. He then went into a little bit of creative accountancy. As the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) said, those opposite are going to cut this, cut that and cut the other, and yet they are going to spend more money on roads.

In my opening remarks I also want to pay a tribute to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) who has seconded the honourable member for McPherson's motion, but who has been accommodating enough to allow me to speak in this debate and to reserve his right to speak at a later date. I am particularly grateful that, given the interest he has in roads in his electorate and the concern he has for a number of the road networks in the Bendigo area that need to be upgraded, he has been prepared to defer and allow me this opportunity to participate in the debate, partly to his immediate disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) that I was just a little amused at his comments, because he claimed a great deal of credit for the improvement in the road network in the electorate of Throsby and suggested that this had indicated that he had been a most effective local member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The irony of those remarks, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, would be well aware, is that the honourable member for Throsby needs to convince honourable members&mdash;not those on this side of the House, but those on the other side&mdash;that he has been a most effective local member, if he wishes to continue to be the local member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge, however, the point validly made by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) that it does not matter on which side of the House honourable members are in this debate, not enough money is being spent on road funding. I am not here as a member of the Opposition suggesting that under the Hawke or Keating governments road funding somehow dried up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a coincidence that, in order to accommodate a Rotary exchange student visiting my local Rotary club, I drove on Sunday from my home base of Gawler in South Australia to Canberra on Sunday to this parliamentary sitting. In the process I must admit that I noticed that a great deal has been done to upgrade the Sydney-Melbourne link and, from the few occasions that I have driven that route, I could see that it was in better condition than it has ever been. But having said that, I also had to get somehow from the Riverland area of South Australia to Wagga Wagga across the Hay plain, where a great deal of work remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No party on either side of the House can afford to stand and claim some sort of monopoly on road funding wisdom. The plea that the Opposition makes&mdash;entirely defensibly, because we are the Opposition and our task is to alert both the Government and the people of Australia to things that are not being done as well as they ought to be done&mdash;is a simple one. It is not that nothing has been done, but that more needs to be done in road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the infrastructure system of this enormous continent and we are talking about the obligation we have as parliamentarians to ensure that the maximum amount of money is focused on road funding so that goods can get from farm to port and so that people can get to facilities. I have no doubt that after the next election, when we are on the other side of the House, there will be honourable members opposite making a plea for more funds for roads, no matter how much is being spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point remains that currently in Australia we have a real infrastructure run-down and the criticism the Opposition offers of the Government's road funding program is this: the Government is collecting more in fuel excise than any government has ever collected. It has gone from $1.5 billion when we lost office to something like $4.8 billion in real terms, and that money is not being targeted to roads. That is what we are simply saying; that is what the honourable member for McPherson points out, particularly in section  2  of his motion  where  he  calls on the House to recognise that money raised by road user charges should be directed to roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This plea is a plea for fuel excise to be spent on roads. The honourable member for Fisher has said that he was a local government councillor and had a lot of experience. He does not have a monopoly on that because many of the others in this chamber, including the Deputy Speaker, have such experience. What I want to point out to the honourable member for Fisher is that, while the councils in his area might be masters of their own destiny, they are certainly not masters of their own destiny in rural areas such as mine or in those areas represented by the Deputy Speaker or, to a lesser degree, by the Parliamentary Secretary at the table, because in those rural areas there is no way councils can be responsible for road maintenance and road funding or allocate sufficient funds for that purpose, as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) must be painfully well aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these roads in sparsely populated rural areas are not there only to service those rural communities; they are there because the people working in the rural areas are involved in generating the very goods this nation needs to turn around its balance of payments deficit. So all of the taxpayers and road users around Australia have a responsibility to ensure that they are accepting some of the cost of keeping these roads in sufficiently good state to get these goods delivered to the ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said in this debate about how motorists are not all that disadvantaged. Frankly, this is not a plea just for motorists; it is also a plea for road transport operators. The coalition's Fightback package has been targeted at making it cheaper for road transport operators to operate and so reduce the real cost burden being borne by isolated rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made by the honourable member for Fisher about what presumably the Opposition has failed to do. Why the Opposition? There is every possibility that by the time of the next election we will have been the Opposition for a decade. It is astonishing that after being in opposition for a decade we are still called to account for the state of Australian roads. Responsibility for that rests with honourable members opposite and we will continue to point that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While much is made of what the Opposition would do, I have heard nothing from any honourable member opposite about what the Government proposes to do with its road user charge schedule. I have heard nothing about what it proposes to do. Government members have not addressed the issue, even though they are the Government and the people responsible for raising the revenue and upgrading the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here simply to belittle what the Government is about. I wrote to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown) about a specific stretch of road in my electorate that</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent study has been commissioned to examine these routes and to help determine the most appropriate routes which best meet the national highway objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to use this portion of the debate to point out to the House and to Australia at large that if the Government is proposing an independent study to look at national highway routes, it is time it made all honourable members aware of the fact that that study is in progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members need that information because this independent study is expected to report to the Minister by mid-1992. I want to say to the members of this study that if they are looking at the direction that national highway routes ought to take, then in order not to disappoint the honourable member for Throsby let me point out to the House a map which indicates how running through my electorate from Morgan in the Riverland&mdash;a route that will be well known to the Parliamentary Secretary at the table&mdash;through Burra to Spalding, there is a real opportunity to make a much more direct route from Sydney to Perth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion, but before going onto that, I would like to make some points in relation to road funding, and just put the facts, as have the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). Road funding has steadily increased in real terms since the inception of the current road funding program in 1988-89. The average road funding level in real terms for the last nine years, under the Labor Government, as the honourable member for Fisher said, is 22 per cent greater than the average level of road funding provided for under the seven years of the Fraser Government. In 1991-92, road funding has increased nominally by $130.3m or nearly 9 per cent over funding provided in 1990-91. This is a real terms increase of almost $85m or 5.5 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real terms increase is due mainly to the additional funding allowed for under the employment statement of November 1991 and the One Nation statement, which are independent of fuel excise. This trend will continue in 1992-93 as a result of a huge injection of road funding announced in the One Nation statement totalling $437.5m in 1992-93. This continues the Government's commitment to the development of a better integrated national land transport network and allows the Federal Government to maintain a large construction program at a time when many States are not necessarily providing funds for maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a lot of money to be saved, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said, with improving integrated transport in this country. Profits to be made from farm gate to market have definitely got potential, but we do need the cooperation and the support of all six State governments but also, importantly, local government. There is a role to play for the three levels working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much was said on the other side of the House about fuel excise and where the money goes that does not go into roads. I think I have proved the point that we have increased funding for roads, so I will move on from that. The money from fuel excise that does not go into roads goes into hospitals, housing, education, and the basic infrastructure, such as home and community care and all those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) wants to take money out of those areas, he should come in here and say so. I oppose money coming out of those areas and I support the present program. I have continually said that while we are increasing funding for roads, as I have pointed out, I do not believe that all the money should go into roads at the expense of health, housing, education and all the other facilities that we provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made, of course, is that we give a lot of money&mdash;I think it is something like 75 per cent&mdash;to the States. A lot of that is untied and the States can determine where they wish to spend the money. They are all big boys and they are able to stand on their own two feet and make the decisions and then accept the consequences of those decisions in their own electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, further to the point, then comes local government and local government also gets untied grants. They have the opportunity to determine where their priorities are. But what is happening with local government, particularly in Queensland? There is opposition to amalgamation of shires to maintain power&mdash;that is all&mdash;for the National Party at the expense of micro-economic reform and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not their responsibility, as they view it, of sharing a little bit of micro-economic reform and putting Australia first. It is about maintaining a power base that is more in line with Tennessee in 1930. One of the problems with improving transport across this country is that it requires all three levels working together, and certainly more effort in Queensland has been used through the Local Government Association in opposing the amalgamation of shires than has been used in actually getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the term of the Bjelke-Petersen Government over some seven years, the Self report showed, and I have said it many times in this House, that $40m&mdash;and it was misquoted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as $400m and I missed it and did not correct it, so I would like to correct it now&mdash;was ripped off local government in transfer charges by the Bjelke-Petersen Government. Not one word was said by the RACQ in Queensland. Not one word was said by the leaders or spokesmen of local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time it came to an election, out they would trot with their anti-Labor propaganda, particularly two clowns in the Wide Bay area&mdash;Mackintosh and Roberts&mdash;who have never once stuck up for local government and opposed the rip-off of transfer charges. They have never stood up against the drought rorts which took another $30m out of their own constituency,  but they oppose freer trade and the fact that we are now selling dairy products that come out of the South Burnett area, the south-eastern Queensland area, overseas. They oppose that process by wanting to put up protection and ban products coming into this country. Goodness me&mdash;they are the sorts of people that are running local government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one goes to some of these local government shires, one can see the big mausoleums that are built for millions of dollars so that councillors can sit in there and pretend that they are really important, instead of having the courage to make some tough decisions supporting amalgamations and achieving better economies of scale so that they can actually deliver better services for their own constituency. When one sees the way in which some local governments are elected, it makes a mockery of democracy, quite frankly, an absolute mockery. Some divisions have about 30 or 40 people and others, particularly in the smaller towns, have 600 to 1,000, to elect one person each. And they talk about being efficient and effective in the modern world! The spotlight ought to go back onto local government, particularly in Queensland, and I would like to compliment the Goss Government for moving on that. Tom Burns is a breath of fresh air in that regard. I think everyone in Queensland loves Tom. One of the National Party politicians in my area, Doug Slack, even came out and praised him the other day, and that really says something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we listen to what the Opposition has had to say about road user charges, I think it brings in an interesting contrast. We are looking at and working with State governments to have road user charges along with excise. We have been doing that for quite some time; in fact, the Butcher report came out something like two years ago and we have been working through that process. When road user charges were first mentioned, rural communities, spokesmen and representatives of organisations like the UGA and the Cattlemen's Union came out and opposed road user charges and voiced some legitimate concerns in regards to the impact that such charges would have on transporting beef in particular, and grain and sheep as well, in far-flung areas. The Road Transport Association both in Queensland and nationally also was very concerned and showed that it did not actually support that proposition. But what does the Opposition have as a policy? Abolishing excise and moving totally over time, it says in Fightback, to road user charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that I have not heard those same organisations coming out and saying, `We do not want this'. If they did not want part road user charges with excise, I would like to know why the UGA, the Cattlemen's Union and the grain growers are not coming out and saying, `We do not want full road user charges'. Obviously they are not aware of this fact because otherwise it would be a little bit of duplicity on their part. I am sure that they would put the interests of their own members first, I am sure that they would not be politically biased enough to support a proposition of road user charges that would force trucks off the roads in rural communities, or which, if it is not at a proper level to maintain roads, would see roads crumble and fall apart. I do not believe that they would purposely in a machiavellian way do that, because I do believe they put their rural constituency first most of the time. But why does not Bill Bonthrone from the UGA come out and say, `I do not want a bar of full road user charges and I do not want a bar of Fightback' when he was concerned, as were many other people, in regards to the effect that part road user charges, along with excise, would have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other nonsense that needs to be put to rest is that, if we were to forgo excise, the full amount would be passed on to the consumer. Quite obviously, the Opposition does believe in the tooth fairy and I think that Wirths Circus has got plenty of talent to look at on the other side of the House if it ever runs short, if that is what those opposite really believe. In the 1988 Federal Budget, we reduced excise on low alcohol beer. Was the decrease passed on to the publicans and passed on to the consumers? No, it was not, because the breweries took the difference. A publican said to me, `We cannot pass it on because we are getting our beer in at the same rate'. The same thing would happen with petroleum. </PARA>

What he was saying is that the States would not spend any more money&mdash;they get all this money from the Commonwealth Government in untied grants and they will not spend it on roads. What he forgets is that every State government, including his own Labor State Government, has had the funding from the Commonwealth Government cut back enormously. Even in New South Wales in the last four years it has been something like $1.8 billion. Every State government has been cut back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, it would come as a bit of a shock to you, I know, were I not to mention the Pacific Highway when speaking here on a motion concerning roads. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and as everybody in Australia really knows, it is essential that we get a new Pacific Highway from Hexham to the Queensland border; and it should be a four-lane, dual carriageway, divided highway. I applaud the extra money that has been provided by the Federal Government and by the State Government, which is a doubling of funding to $300m, in the current three-year period. I express my concern for the future of that funding and I say to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) that he should be taking steps right now to ensure that that funding does continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that about the Pacific Highway, what I really want to concentrate on is local government roads. I want to make a plea for more funding for local government so that it can provide better roads for the people it is serving. Local government undoubtedly is the poor relation in all the tiers of government, but it has the most roads, the greatest length of roads: it has the basic network of the transport infrastructure of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking only this morning to a Mr Brian Semple of Great Lakes Shire Council who was telling me about some research that he was doing on using bump meters to assess road conditions. A bump meter is a special little machine which is attached to the axles of trucks and registers the roughness of the road. It is really very interesting. The raised axle loading weights now permitted are fine on the highways and they are fine on RTA standard pavements, but they are too heavy for the sort of pavement that most local governments provide. In fact, a great many local roads cannot cope. Many were built, say, 20 years ago and bitumened on a shoestring. Local government was looking really to rebuild those roads in five to 10 years, but of course there has been no funding and the reality is that this current Labor Government has cut road funding in real terms ever since it has been in office. Those opposite can bluster and say what they like, but they cannot escape the truth: Labor has cut road funding and, therefore, had a disastrous effect on the road profiles in local government. Over 30 per cent of the roads have more than an acceptable level of bumps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do is get additional funding into local government because there has been reduced funding in real terms. After the urban network is looked after, an extremely small amount of funds is available for rural and regional roads. The proportion of funding going into the urban environment is tilted even more to the cities. Therefore, I make the point very clearly that the Federal Government must provide more road funding for local government. </PARA>

These are the people who are picking up the tab for the worst recession this country has experienced for 60 years, the recession the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said `we had to have'. He certainly has a lot to answer for.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that, at the beginning of 1990, almost 600,000 Australians were out of work. That figure was bad enough, but in the last two short years the total has risen to almost a million. That is, 538 people have lost their jobs every day, 22 people every hour, since the 1990 election campaign. Remember the 1990 election campaign? That was the one during which the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister, promised there would be no recession. About a third of the almost one million people now officially listed as unemployed have been out of work for 12 months or longer; more than half have been unemployed for longer than six months. These figures take no account of the more than half a million additional people who are not registered as unemployed, but who are nonetheless actively trying to find work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an alarming and depressing fact that many of the people who lost their jobs at the beginning of the recession in 1990 have still not been able to find other employment, although hardly surprising when one considers that for each job advertised there are more than 70 unemployed people. It is also a disgraceful indication of the price ordinary Australians are having to pay for this Government's inability to effectively and competently control the economic affairs of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our present and previous Prime Ministers may boast about job creation schemes, but in reality hundreds of thousands of jobs have disappeared. In April this year, unemployment, at 10.4 per cent, was still at postwar record levels despite the empty claims and unrealistic expectations of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). One wonders how this Government can keep promising improvements when at the same time it keeps introducing measures such as training levies and increases in compulsory superannuation, which in some cases positively discourage and in others effectively prohibit employers from increasing their work force. Have those opposite never heard of the proverbial straw breaking the camel's back?</PARA>

For these Australians and their families, compulsory superannuation is really compulsory redundancy. Has the cosseted Keating Cabinet no realisation at all of what it is actually like out there in the real world? Have those opposite no idea of how many small and, for that matter, medium and large businesses have already gone to the wall or are just tottering on the brink? Do they not understand that many businesses no longer have the capacity to shoulder further government imposed costs?  For many, there are now only two options available: sack more staff or shut the doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Australian businesses are struggling to keep their heads above water, in the homes of our nation the battle for survival is even more critical. Almost 50 per cent of the more than half a million people who have been unemployed for longer than six months are married. The Bureau of Statistics figures which were released only a week ago show that in April this year almost 680,000 Australian children are growing up in homes where neither parent has a job. This figure has grown by 63,000 in just four months, and is increasing by more than 500 a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a most terrible situation. It is intolerable and unforgivable that there are many thousands of Australian families collapsing under the weight of the burden of the `recession we had to have'. The increasing financial pressures on families and family members inevitably lead to a breaking down of their independence, confidence, dignity and self-esteem. This, in turn, creates other problems&mdash;for example, difficulties with personal and family relationships, which result in an escalating number of family break-ups, more homeless children, increases in child abuse and domestic violence and increases in illegal and prescribed drug abuse and in the crime rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raw statistics are dreadful enough, but they are just numbers. It is only when we look behind the figures that we can start to appreciate the full extent of the tragedy, and the full impact on Australians and their families of the `recession we had to have'. In my electorate of Casey, a fairly typical outer suburban, inner rural electorate, the effects of unemployment are obvious. Every day, people contact my office to express their concern and their despair about the current unemployment crisis. Some are young, some are middle-aged, some are older; some are men, some are women; some are single, some are married; some have children to support and some do not. But they all have one thing in common: they are all demoralised and despondent. Many are obviously depressed and quite desperate and, almost without exception, it is the effect on their families of their inability to get work that is their greatest worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all well aware of the tragedy of youth unemployment, but we do not hear so frequently about the situation of the over-25 age group. Let me quote a few examples. One well-qualified and experienced engineer in his mid-thirties showed me his job applications file of over 2,000 letters, carefully handwritten because he cannot afford typing or photocopying. He considers himself lucky if he gets an acknowledgment. On one occasion, he was even offered a job, but the company went to the wall the week before he was due to start. `I am not even 40, and I am on the scrap heap', he told me. `I feel that I have let my wife and family down. We are just hanging together now, that is all. I do not know for how much longer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another young married man told me he was afraid to tell his wife, who was expecting their first child, that he had been retrenched two weeks previously. `I have spent every day looking for work. I will take anything at all. But there is nothing; nothing. I do not know how to tell my wife. I do not know what we are going to do, because there is no way we will be able to cope on unemployment benefits. It is all so hopeless. I just did not think that this would happen to me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the young lady who completed an honours degree at Monash University last year. Her final results were excellent. She is bright, attractive and intelligent, and lives at home with the family. `I go right through the columns of every newspaper and apply for anything remotely within my area of training', she said. `Sometimes I am lucky enough to get an interview, but so far I have always been told that I have the qualifications but not the experience. But how can I get experience when I cannot even get a job? It is pretty awful when you really study hard to get a good qualification, and then you do not even have a chance to use it. Everybody keeps saying that training is the solution, but what is the point of training people if there are no jobs for them to go to?'. Another is a 50-year-old tradesmen who two months ago finally admitted that his prospects of getting another job were virtually non-existent and so applied for unemployment benefits. `I am the only member of my family to ever be on the dole', he told me. `The day I went down to Social Security was one of the worst days of my life. It was the day I finally admitted I was useless'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are just four examples. I could provide many more, as, I am sure, could every other member of this Parliament. Now we are being told by the architects of this disastrous unemployment situation that we have turned the corner. The Treasurer is quoted in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying that the economy had `unmistakably' emerged from the recession. Unfortunately his optimism is not shared by many others. For example, on the same page in the same newspaper, columnist Ross Gittins comments on our `invisible recovery':</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is an economic recovery, we had better pray there is no relapse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anaemic, unsteady and uneven growth revealed in yesterday's national accounts figures flatly contradicted the claim by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, that the economy is `on the path to widespread and sustained economic growth'. Either he was trying to boost the Government's flagging political stocks or he just does not understand the numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>So where are we actually at? What is the real situation? As the Duke of Windsor said, when he observed the plight of the unemployed in the villages of Wales during the Great Depression of the 1920s, `Something must be done'. The same applies in Australia in 1992. But in our case, the something that must be done does not include more empty promises, more unrealistic claims or more talkfests, summits or seminars. The something Australia and Australians need can be summed up in one four letter word&mdash;work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the little known elements of the Opposition's dreadful GST proposal is the impact it would have on sport in Australia, if ever the Opposition got the chance to govern. The imposition of a GST would have devastating impacts on sport, particularly local community based sporting organisations servicing adults and children in little clubs throughout the length and breadth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of my constituents are active participants in sport every week at scores of venues across the electorate of Moreton. These activities are organised and run almost exclusively by volunteer effort&mdash;by people who have a keen interest in promoting a healthy lifestyle, a love of their sport and a desire to enhance the skills and physical development of young people. They run their programs in a very professional manner on skimpy budgets and with scant resources; but the executive committees, the trainers and coaches, the team managers and the dedicated parents and/or spouses who support their family players do a marvellous job. They are the very backbone of Australia's reputation as a great sporting nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not alarmist to suggest that these people are very worried about the possibility that the Opposition members could win Government and introduce their goods and services tax. They know that the introduction of a GST would be a severe burden on sport and on their local club. It would put a massive administrative burden on club executives, considerably increase the costs for participants, lead to a fall in revenue which would impact on sporting operations, and increase the cost of these activities for the clubs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us explore a few of these issues further. The Opposition ignores the enormous administrative burden that would be placed on Australia's 30,000 sporting clubs with a GST. Almost all of these clubs are small non-profit organisations staffed by volunteer administrators, coaches and managers. Each of the clubs is expected by the Liberals to become a tax collector for the Government. They will have to pay a GST on consumables such as uniforms, electricity, advertising, travel and venue hire, and charge the extra 15 per cent on members' dues, sale of items, player participation fees, coaching fees and so on. The administration and accounting workload would be horrendous and quite beyond the capacity of many clubs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the club has an annual turnover of less than $30,000 it would have to pay GST on all its purchases, but could choose whether to register and collect the GST. But if it does not register, it cannot collect GST on its revenues and therefore cannot offset the GST it has had to pay. Organisations with a turnover over $30,000 must register. Thus, all sporting organisations down to the local level will become responsible for collecting and remitting the GST on any taxable activities they conduct. It will involve keeping track of every transaction involving goods or services and collecting and remitting tax as appropriate. Clubs will be expected to maintain full and accurate accounting procedures, but would not receive any assistance for the purchase of new equipment or software to do such work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A GST will substantially increase the cost of sport to all participants and supporters. Obviously that means participants from lower income groups, particularly from large families, will find it much more difficult to participate in sport. Sport is an item of discretionary expenditure for most families, which means that if the cost increases people will choose not to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although my family could not be classified as a low income family, the sporting and recreational activities of my three children do reflect the pattern of many Australian families of similar age and composition. I have two daughters and a son, ranging in age from 11 to five years. The eldest, a daughter, is coached in tennis, tae kwon do and ballet and plays school netball; my son, who is eight, plays soccer, is in little athletics and is coached in tennis and tae kwon do; and the youngest girl learns jazz ballet and tae kwon do. All of these activities cost our family for coaching lessons, membership of clubs, play participation fees, uniforms, equipment, plus all the contributions for various fundraising activities by the club during the year. This amounts to more than $2,000 a year for our family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of a GST will increase the cost of almost all of these elements and will force most families, particularly those on low and middle incomes, to curtail their children's, or their own, participation in sport. Coaching lessons will attract an additional 15 per cent tax; entry fees into competitions will be subject to the GST; admission charges for both participants and spectators will cost 15 per cent more; uniforms, tracksuits, shorts, jumpers, socks, boots, et cetera will rise by 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change on the cost of sporting equipment will be negligible. Currently, a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent applies. The Opposition will drop the wholesale tax and apply 15 per cent on the retail price, which will basically keep the price of sporting equipment at the same level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are selected to compete in regional, State or national competition, the impact will be even more dramatic. Not only will they face all of the extra costs already outlined but also the additional burden of GST on air fares, accommodation, meals and other services while they are away from home will be prohibitive. Even if they receive any form of sponsorship in cash or in kind, this support will be subject to a GST of 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas experience shows us that the imposition of a GST has a severely negative impact on sporting organisations. In both Canada and New Zealand since the introduction of a GST, sporting clubs have suffered increased costs, loss of revenue, considerable decline in participation and an inability to attract volunteers to fill executive positions. Many clubs have simply ceased to function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has said openly that the GST is about passing on the cost to users&mdash;in sport that means the participants. The increased costs resulting from the GST will hit all participants in sport, regardless of income. It will force many thousands of skilled and talented players from low and middle income families out of sport. The GST is by definition a regressive tax. A regressive tax is one that takes a higher proportion of a low income earner's pay than that of a higher income earner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely clear from the Treasury analysis of the full Fightback package that the Liberals cannot and will not fully compensate families with an income below $40,000 a year for the cost of a GST. If these families are at all interested in sport or want to cultivate a healthy attitude and lifestyle in their children, they will be even more out of pocket through the policy of the Liberals. All people interested in sport in our community&mdash;whether as a player, a coach, an administrator, a parent, a partner, a supporter or spectator&mdash;must oppose the GST at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be doing everything in my power in the months ahead to ensure that everyone in the electorate of Moreton is made fully aware of the dangerous and devastating implications that the Opposition's policies have for our Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the introduction of a GST is not the only attack on sport by the Opposition. It also wishes to eliminate all Federal Government support for local community sporting organisations to assist in the provision of facilities for sport. One of the most important funding programs announced in the last Federal Budget was the reintroduction of the community sporting, cultural and recreation facilities program. This program, with funding of $30m over three years, provides one-off grants to community clubs and groups to assist in the building of playing fields, club rooms, exercise facilities, lighting, fencing, training areas, equipment purchase, et cetera. It gives a real boost to those thousands of non-profit community groups so that they have a few less raffles to sell, a few less barbecues to organise, or a few less lamingtons to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth contribution is a significant factor in accelerating the provision of valuable new facilities in our communities. The Opposition has announced that it will abolish this program. It demonstrates its absolute contempt for community effort. It clearly shows all volunteers that the Liberals have no respect for their work or their contribution to our community. The allocation of these grants goes across the whole country. It is non-political and a real attempt to assist in the betterment of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Labor Government will continue to assist sport, both large and small, throughout the community. The Labor Government recognises the enormous contribution made by these clubs to the physical development of our young people and the growth of our society, and we will continue to support sport in our communities. </PARA>

Let the honourable member tell those sportsmen who have to travel those distances he mentioned that they have to pay the outrageous taxes that honourable members opposite put on the vehicles and the fuel that they will consume in getting there. Let the honourable member remember that there are few sporting organisations of the type he mentions that collect money at the gate. They are battling to get people to watch their kids half the time and, of course, they consequently do not turn over in excess of $30,000 and they will not register as GST payers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in grieving today is to raise a few issues about law and order, about justice, about a fair go, and to use as an example some of the industrial relations mayhem that is going on in this country at the moment. History is littered with the corpses of innocent individuals who were conscripted into other people's struggles for power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, of course, that when one debates these issues, one can always find a bit of case history. The bit of case history to which I wish to refer is happening at this very moment. It has been mentioned time and again in this Parliament and, put in simple terms, it is called the APPM dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one starts to talk about justice and rights one is reminded of the compelling speech of the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) of some minutes ago when he described the devastation in the lives of certain people because of unemployment. One wonders, if those people had a job at APPM, how they might feel today. Those who were working at APPM until recent times were earning somewhere between $22,000 a year&mdash;that was the minimum&mdash;and $77,000 a year. They could hardly be considered underpaid; they could hardly be considered deprived. They achieved part of that because, amongst their rights, delivered by their company, was that they got 25 per cent overaward payments. Over and above those figures they got 9 per cent superannuation. If things got tough and the company had difficulty keeping them in employment, they got a redundancy agreement based on three weeks pay for one year of work. They were working a 35-hour week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 March the company issued a statement saying that those amounts would remain, those conditions would remain, the minimum $22,000 for the lowest paid worker would remain but that some restrictive work practices had to go. I will quote only one of those, and that is the restrictive work practice that says that the spare parts store in an operation that runs around the clock is black-banned by all workers between 4 p.m. and 8 a.m. In other words, if in any part of the plant something breaks, nobody working there at that point in time is allowed to go to the store and get, say, a nut to keep things going. There is a solution to it. You ring up one of the storemen and you bring him back on double time for a full shift to go out, pick out a nut off the shelf, give it to the person who needs it and then presumably go home. That is what APPM said was enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear and it is not in dispute that APPM told its workers that it was not attacking all the privileges they have above other workers; it was not attacking those  who had these privileges when a million had none. That is what it told them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wonder where trade union bureaucrats decided that there was a problem and why it ever had to come to industrial action. Where is the problem? We know where the problem is. The problem is that the company sent this information to its work force and did not send it to the Tasmanian Labor Senate candidate, Shane Murphy. Mr Murphy&mdash;who has had more influence in that mill and over its 1,300 employees, including the manager, than the shareholders who risked their money to give these people jobs&mdash;got his nose out of joint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whom is this dispute about? It is not a dispute between the bulk of the workers of Burnie. It is a dispute now, because the workers have lost 20 days of wages, but it was not a dispute in the beginning: it was about union power. Of course, if anybody thinks that trade union bureaucrats do not want power, let us be reminded of the words of Bill Kelty when he made his famous speech after the IRC had rejected accord mark VI. He said to the assembled senior bureaucrats of the trade union movement, `If we let the IRC get away with this, we will lose all our power'. He did not say, `Our members will be unable to buy clothes for their children'. That was not his concern. His concern was: `We will lose all our power'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, quite stupidly, his President, Martin Ferguson, has gone down there to demonstrate a bit of union power. He has not succeeded, and he will keep those 1,300 out of a job until such time as he can save face. That is the sort of situation confronting people who want a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is worse than that. The area of my greatest concern is the prostitution of the police force in this matter. Might I add that no credit goes to the Government of Tasmania in this matter. Of course, the company has been forced to go to the courts to get the police to do its job. How must the typical policeman feel about that? But it has been going on for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my State there was reported in the newspapers a mechanism to create an industrial dispute: because a person had been told that he could not drive his car into a dangerous area where no-one else was allowed to drive a car, a member of the plumbers union took a hacksaw from the boot of his car and sawed through the pipe that provided the water supply to the site, resulting of course in a breakdown of all the toilet facilities and forcing employees to leave the site. I rang the police and said, `Has this man been charged with vandalism?'. They said, `No, it is an industrial dispute'. I keep looking at the laws of Australia and I cannot find any special reference telling police how to act in an industrial dispute. It is very clear that Justice Wright could not, either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the spectacle of a police commissioner and his representatives having to go into court and say that the police could not take on the issue in Burnie because they lacked the resources. Of course, the judge there described that evidence as frightening. He said also that on most issues the evidence was the same, but on one where there was conflict he chose not to believe the police&mdash;further denigration because they had been told not to give people what is a fundamental freedom, their right to walk around in peace and to enter a workplace if they choose. If I had a longer period for my speech, I would be reading out more of the things he said. He said that picketers were entitled to make a protest against a perceived injustice or violation of their rights in a peaceful and orderly manner&mdash;and I would support him wholeheartedly. But then he said that, once their conduct ceases to have that character, police intervention is called for and should be expected. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express concern about the way the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority, identified as the RTA, is treating funding it receives under the Federal road black spot program. The Fairfield City Council local government area, within my electorate of Prospect, is notorious for road accidents and intersection black spots. Our Federal Government black spot program has been more than generous in the issuing of funding to the Fairfield local government area, with a total of $518,000 being granted since April 1991. However, $315,000 of that money still has not been utilised. I want to know why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was informed of funding for the black spot program involving intersections in the Fairfield local government area in February 1992, I said that not only would these grants help the community by reducing the cost to society of road accidents in insurance and injury costs but also, as the funding was also aimed at areas where unemployment was relatively high, the funding of road works would create jobs. However, the RTA has delayed works on three projects in my electorate for which Federal funding has been made readily available, thereby depriving the people in our area of the benefits the road works would bring to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $40,000 in funding was allocated to modify traffic signals at the intersection of the Cumberland Highway and Victoria Street in Smithfield. It had a proposed completion date of December 1991 in the RTA's submission. Following a recent audit, it was found that that project was now due to be completed by October 1992&mdash;10 months after the original proposed date of completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets better. The second project that I am concerned about is one which receives $75,000 in Federal funding&mdash;to build a roundabout at the intersection of Sackville Street and The Avenue in Canley Vale. Apparently, in the submission outlining this project, the expected completion was stated to be April 1991. Information I have now received states that the project is due to be completed by December this year&mdash;almost 18 months later. We also find that the $75,000 was not enough to install a roundabout and, therefore, they will now have to go with the installation of traffic signals. Of course, the traffic signals are covered by the RTA. Again, I would like answered: who submitted this project for funding? Who costed this project for funding? Why is this project not completed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the project I am most concerned about is the signal reconstruction of the Horsley Drive and Nelson Street intersection at Fairfield. Our Government, again, has approved $200,000 to be spent on these works, which were meant to be completed by June 1992. I am now informed that that project will not be finished until June 1993. Again, I ask why. Again, I get told, `We have only got about three to four contractors working. The One Nation statement has put extra work on us, has provided extra funding. We now have too much work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On investigating this situation still further with Fairfield City Council, I was informed that Council knew nothing about these projects and that they were the total responsibility of the State Government's Roads and Traffic Authority. The Council said that it had not included these intersections in any of its submissions for black spot funding and that the RTA had not informed the Council that it was asking for funding for these intersections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there are six projects which are the Council's responsibility, and which were granted funding in January 1992&mdash;and, I might add, still have not been started&mdash;I have been assured by Fairfield City Council that these projects will be completed by the end of this month and certainly by mid-July. I can assure one and all that I will be following that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to one of Fairfield Council's reports in its submission for black spot funding, the Fairfield local government area, the LGA, experiences one of the highest crash and injury totals of any LGA in Australia. In 1989, 27 people were killed, 211 people  were seriously injured and 1,015 people suffered minor injuries in over 2,113 crashes. During that year, Fairfield experienced the second highest crash frequency for all categories of injury for local government areas in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this shocking situation, our Government granted Fairfield City Council $90,000 to establish a Fairfield road safety strategy under the Federal black spot program. An important part of this strategy is to introduce a road user behaviour improvement program developed with a local focus, in conjunction with the council, local police, local schools and other local community groups, utilising local media and resources. This project aims to influence the behavioural factors contributing to road accidents and injury such as speeding, drink driving, fatigue and the problem of not wearing seat belts. I had the great pleasure of attending the launch of the Fairfield road safety strategy, called Streets Ahead, on 13 April this year and I have been impressed to see the campaign being carried out by the council with regular articles on road safety in the local press and the organisation of local activities focusing on traffic enforcement issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fairfield City Council assures me that it is working towards making the roads in the Fairfield LGA safer to travel on and is intent on re-educating much of the local community about road safety. However, I come back to the fact that the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority just does not seem to be holding up its end of the bargain, its responsibility to the people of Fairfield. I would like to know why work on the three projects I outlined earlier has not begun and why Fairfield City Council was not informed by the RTA of their inclusion in a submission to our Federal Government for funding. I am informed, following my investigation, that the RTA utilises submissions made by the council to form the basis of its submission to the Federal Office of Road Safety for funding under the Federal black spots program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What assurances does the Government have that our New South Wales councils are properly represented in submissions by the RTA? Have there been instances where the RTA decided not to include a project in its submission to our Government for funding, when the council requesting the funding believed the project to be of importance to its community? What can be done in instances like that? How can our councils be sure that projects they feel should be funded will be chosen by the RTA to be included in the submission for funding? I personally believe it is disgraceful that more than $300,000 would be sitting waiting to be utilised in an area with a notorious accident reputation and with a need for works which could increase safety and certainly produce more employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on our Minister for Land Transport to investigate when the RTA will begin work on these three projects in my electorate that have been neglected so shamefully, and also where the money is. My investigations show that these projects have been paid for by our Federal Government. Fairfield City Council certainly has not received the money, so again I ask: where is the $315,000 that could provide the people of Fairfield with a better and safer road system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the concern of the RTA is about too much funding coming from our One Nation statement, if that has put too much pressure on it, why not engage more contractors to do the jobs that need to be completed? The funding is already there. The need is there in my community, the approval is there in my community, the funding is being provided for those areas within my community. Why has the work not been done? If it requires better planning, why is better planning not taking place? If it requires better consultation, why is better consultation not taking place? If it requires the three levels of government to sit down and work out better programming for the efficient use of the finance being provided, why is this not taking place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask all these questions because I am very concerned about what is happening in my area. I am concerned that lives continue to be lost because of neglect of this particular program, I am concerned that everyone has been assured that it is all taking place and we are still waiting for results, and most particularly I am concerned that the delivery of this type of program is not being handled speedily enough for the community and the constituents that I represent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to bring to the attention of honourable members in this place and the people of Australia the disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money through the direct Commonwealth Government funding of union activities. Many people already know of the predilection of State and Federal Labor governments for favouring certain community groups with substantial government grants. For instance, the Australia Council grants $52,000 to the deregistered Builders Labourers Federation for artists and muralists and $8,272 to the Food Preservers Union for leadlight and ceramics classes. Then we had the Office of the Status of Women grant of $11,000 to design and develop a special surfboard for women, and the even more bizarre community employment program grant of $31,680 to four people for 18 weeks to train and work with a professional clown. All of these grants were symptomatic of the excesses of the 1980s before the onset of the recession we had to have, to use the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, a document emanating from the Commonwealth Department of Industrial Relations, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Workplace Reform Program Overview</EMPHASIS>, has been brought to my notice. It obviously provides the detail relating to that section of the previous Prime Minister's industry policy statement of March 1991 which referred to trade union amalgamations. Page 5.62 of that previous statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successful (trade union) amalgamations depend on well-run educational campaigns to convince union members. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is providing financial assistance towards running such campaigns and the considerable legal costs involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on the statement also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990-91 a total of $2m is being made available for this purpose. . . and $2m will be provided in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA>This overview lists, in detail, proposed expenditure by the Government, which is synonymous with `by the taxpayer', to achieve the union amalgamations listed on the final pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Stone, in his article `Political favours corrupt public morals' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 28 May, refers to the way the enormous spread of State intervention has created a galaxy of government `client' groups within the community. Mr Stone states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These groups seek financial and other favours from governments. In turn, those governments expect electoral favours, including contributions to party funds, whenever they face an election.</PARA>
<PARA>He argues that this leads to `a debasement of public morality'. This debasement has become an art form among certain Labor governments. On March 25 of this year, the Victorian Kirner Government's `statement on jobs' to `restore confidence' included a decision in small print, on page 19, to grant $3m for the restoration of the Melbourne Trades Hall. Most here who know the Melbourne Trades Hall would have to question, as I do, what are its historical virtues which could justify the spending of $3m for such a purpose. The exercise smacks of favours for union mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The favours contained in the document at my disposal today include the following: the merger between the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union and the Association of Draftsmen, Supervisors and Technical Engineers, in order to form the Metal and Engineering Workers Union, has cost the Australian taxpayers $100,000 and is complete; the merger between the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union and the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries Employees Union, to form the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, has cost the taxpayer $100,000, and is ongoing;the proposed merger of the National Union of Workers, the Transport Workers Union and two other unions, is estimated to cost $125,000. The new union is the National Union of Workers, but the Transport Workers Union is not part of the final arrangement. The expected cost of a merger between the Builders Labourers Federation&mdash;the notorious BLF, again&mdash;and the Building Workers Industrial Union is a mere $90,000. A merger between the Public Service Union and the Professional Officers Association, to be known as the Public Sector Union, will be implemented at a cost of $100,000 to the taxpayer. And so it goes on and on. Thirty-two proposed mergers are listed on pages 50 and 51 of the document. The total cost to the Australian taxpayers is estimated at $1,858,902 for the financial year 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious question which should be posed here is: why should taxpayers be funding any union mergers at all? Imagine the furore if the Government were to fund such business mergers as that of Coles Myer. Trade union amalgamations are not necessarily wrong in themselves, but they should be self-funded. If unions are able to find substantial moneys to help to fund Australian Labor Party election campaigns&mdash;as they do&mdash;any finances for the purpose of reform of their own organisations should be provided by the unions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the amalgamations themselves is only a fraction of the cost of the training assistance, resource centres, et cetera listed in the document to benefit the trade unions of Australia. Under the workplace reform program, on page 2 of the document, the financial allocation for 1990-91 was $8.24m. Actual expenditure under the various headings for 1990-91 was workplace resource centres, $2.71m; work change assistance, $3.76m; work change training, $0.45m; public communications, $0.87m; and management training, $0.45m. Add to this the amount of $4.4m committed for future years of expenditure at that stage in the document and the approximate total for the complete project is $12.64m. I repeat: $12.64m of taxpayers' money for the Labor Government to largely favour its own union mates, plus of course the money being spent on union amalgamations that I have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the individual grants contained in the work change industry section also seem highly questionable, to say the least. One of these, entitled `Overseas Mission (C)', which was approved by the Minister on 21 February 1990 at a cost of $20,000 and involved participation by a Department of Industrial Relations officer in an overseas mission by the State Bank of South Australia and the Australian Bank Employees Union, does not mention the destination of the excursion or its reason. Another item, entitled `Australian Meat Industry Tripartite Overseas Mission, Europe/USA', which is to cost $85,000 and was approved by the Minister on 28 October 1990, was to investigate and analyse the operation of industrial relations management and practices in the meat industry in Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany and the USA. One has to ask: why should Denmark have been included? Surely the only animals processed in Denmark in quantity are pigs. The snouts are well and truly in the trough there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances, there seems to be a doubling up of roles, as is the case in the road transport section, where the `Transport Workers Union of Australia adviser (A)' appears to have been funded to carry out the identical function to the `Australian Road Transport Industrial Organisation (P)'. Each of them is described as `Funding for a Work Change Adviser'. Each was approved by the Minister in 1991&mdash;one in February and one with no month detailed at all. The action officer was the same in each case and the moneys involved were $67,681 and $61,667 respectively. It is all most curious. There are many other examples of work change programs of a similar kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, may I reiterate my original purpose in raising this grievance, and that is to bring to the attention of the members of this House and the people of Australia the disgraceful waste of taxpayers' money through the direct Commonwealth Government funding of trade union activities. This abuse will not be tolerated by a future coalition government and should never have been allowed by this Government. I seek leave to table the key pages of the documents from the Department of Industrial Relations that I referred to throughout the speech. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 June, I spoke of the crippling costs of Australia's legal system to Mr Jeff Gates and his family. The family failed to secure a judgment acknowledging an entitlement under five insurance policies. This was an entitlement which was justified by clearly documented material. Mr Jeff Gates entered a partnership in 1966. He entered into contracts with CML in the names of their sons which were payable to them or their surviving next of kin if he died or to both him and his partner if either or both of their sons died. In 1975 the partnership also entered into another contract with CML, payable if he died to his partner, in order to protect the family. This policy also had benefits payable to the sons through the partner in order to support and educate them. It was explained at the time that in future all policies could be taken over by the company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They purchased a shelf company but in their business they had some $10,000 owed to them by others. This meant that they ceased their business and Mr Gates obtained a position in employment. While working in that position, he acquainted himself with a person in Tasmania and entered a business there. But there was a breach of contract and he was not told by his legal advisers of this breach and he suffered a loss. He stayed in Tasmania and entered into the speculative building field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In about July 1977, he and his partner were advised that a Sydney property they owned had been sold and contracts had been exchanged. They contacted their accountant to see whether they could purchase another shelf company and set up business again. They also contacted the insurance company's representative in order that workers compensation policies in the name of the company could be purchased for him and also to cancel or transfer the other three existing policies over to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unbeknown to Mr and Mrs Gates at the time, the insurance representative could not sell company insurance and only made commissions on policies that he was allowed to sell. He encouraged them to take out another policy and add disability benefits to all those contracts so that they were payable if a disability claim was made; in other words, all policies could be used to claim a disability. The package, according to the insurance firm, was much better than that which was represented and much better than others that were available to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firm said that it would work like this: one policy would pay the partnership $150 a week if Mr Gates were unable to attend work due to an injury, but if he suffered a disability the policy would continue to pay him $150 a week continually for one year, although after 90 days from the date of injury the total of the other four policies would be immediately payable under the disability benefits. It was strongly stated that without this package the partners could possibly be placed in a position where they could lose everything and go bankrupt. They foresaw this as a possibility if they were not protected by insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During all these discussions there were no documents produced by the insurance representative, but they were convinced that the representative was telling the truth. They agreed to alter their planned course of forming a company and covering themselves with other available contracts and entered into the package. In doing so, it was explained that they did not have the funds to pay for all the policies at that time as they were waiting for the sale of a house to go through, but that they would accept the package by first entering into a contract with the insurance company. That was agreed, so they paid the</PARA>
<PARA>insurance contract and agreed to pay the balance after the funds came through. The contract was renewable every 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time the partners asked the representative to check that what he said was totally correct. He supposedly did that, and phoned back the next day and warranted what he had already stated, and they accepted the contracts again. The representative was aware that these contracts were directly related to the partnership and it was completely clear to him that the first project to be undertaken by the partnership was a villa units project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 September 1977 the balance of the moneys was paid for the package and documents were signed, without the proper information being given by the representative. At the time when extra benefits were added, and due to the fact that the total amount payable on death or disability of contracts was in excess of $8,000, the insurance firm asked Mr Gates to have a medical, which he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1979 Mr Gates sustained a back injury and went to a doctor, who sent him to a specialist. A disc injury was confirmed. That he had had an accident was clearly substantiated by a doctor and clearly accepted by a court later on under the jurisdiction of Judge Ellicott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1979 Mr Gates contacted the insurance representative and said that he would be making a claim on the policies. The representative said there would be no problem. However, after the accident and during three weeks rest in bed he complained that the money had not been received. It was then that the insurance firm refused to honour the policy and stated that a clearance certificate was required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turned out, as shown in documented evidence, that the insurance representative did not even put in the claim. Faced with the renouncing of the binding contracts, the Gates family felt that there was no other option but to try to honour the contract with others and try to see whether there were other means, particularly legal means, whereby they could take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually the partners engaged a firm of solicitors. They applied for legal aid to try to have justice done to them. It was clearly indicated to them, through the judgment of Justice Ellicott, that the insurance company was guilty, but he awarded them only $60,000 out of a total award entitlement of some $92,000. In fact, I have a copy here of the underwriting form that was given to Mr Gates. It clearly shows that $92,810 should have been payable to the Gates family under the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given the information to the Minister for Justice (Senator Tate) and asked him to answer a series of questions which I have posed. I hope he will do that and will have the matter thoroughly studied because the Gates family has lost many hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, because of the injustice that was originally done to them on the evidence presented by the insurance firms. I hope that the Minister will take action so that the family can be assisted by the Department either through legal aid or through other means. It must be shown clearly that the amount due to them was not awarded and also shown clearly that they had a huge loss in income as a result of the failure of action through Australia's legal and insurance systems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish today to grieve about our country which is a nation at risk, a nation in debt and a nation out of work. The living standards of average Australians continue to fall. Opportunities for our youth are shrinking. Our social structures, particularly those relating to the family, are under pressure from record unemployment and unprecedented insecurity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The servicing of our international debt makes us financially vulnerable. Many of our rural communities today are watching the fabric of their economic and social structures threatened as low incomes and declining populations make maintenance of sporting clubs, health and education services very difficult. So what has gone wrong and what can we do about it? Where is the strength of that proud independence and initiative of the Aussie battler, which at the turn of the century gave this country the world's highest standard of living?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have different views on the causes. The challenge however is to put the negatives behind us and develop the positives, and the positives lie with the people. On Monday 11 May, as part of the focus on the problems of unemployment, I held meetings and discussions with a diverse group of community and business people, service providers and young and elderly unemployed. Thanks to the technology provided through Telecom, I was able to teleconference the three major centres in my electorate of Swan Hill, Horsham and Mildura. Many of the views and the attitudes that were expressed were not new and they would be repeated no doubt across the nation, but they are real and must have a higher profile than can be given to them by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As occurs with much of the legislation that passes through Parliament, we tend to discuss many of the symptoms of our problems rather than the real causes. Many of these issues have validity and need correcting, such as the duplication and overlap of government services, the wastage of resources through the proliferation of many different agencies and programs all being targeted at the same people. We talk about the need to redirect funding to programs rather than to administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Department of Social Security was generally praised through these discussions for its efforts, some gaps and anomalies were raised&mdash;such as the inconsistencies which exist for people undertaking training programs. In order to claim Austudy, people have to study full time but, by studying longer than 10 hours a week, they lose their Job Search Allowance. We discussed the difficulties young people and particularly young marrieds have on an apprentice's wage, which restricts their taking up opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these legitimate complaints, the common response to the service provided by our government services was adequate, having regard to the horrendous social and economic conditions. Support for the intent of training programs was evident but there was a view that training without jobs and education without opportunity were breeding an understandable cynicism among our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue that received particular emphasis throughout the course of the discussions was housing. There is stress on families seeking rental accommodation, as those who are unemployed can only pay up to $75 per week &mdash;but decent conditions are not available for this money. They are having to live in poor housing or share with other families, which places additional stress on them, particularly if children are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inertia that exists with the Victorian Ministry of Housing and Construction in responding to changing employment and financial circumstances by its clients received widespread criticism. One financial counsellor indicated that those on unemployment benefits are finding it almost impossible to keep up home mortgage payments and that people who are being retrenched because of the current recession are having to drastically alter their entire lifestyle, in some cases having to sell their assets including their house. It would take 20 years or more to rebuild this lost asset base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dearth of suitable housing is further indicated by the flow of families, particularly low income and sole parent families, into lower cost housing in rural areas, having been forced out of metropolitan cities in the depth of the depression. Paradoxically, those who are the future of rural Australia, the most highly skilled rural youth, are moving from traditional country employment and industries to find work in the city regions. A demographic change is occurring throughout Australia and I wonder whether this Government is aware of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern of community leaders and service providers about the tragedy of our unemployment problem and the crisis and hardship of families tended to concentrate naturally on income and counselling support. But it was the young unemployed themselves at these discussions who provided the most enlightened analysis of Australia's current plight. There was a recognition that we have to have employment to have employers and that government policies have to be revised to stabilise what employment opportunities currently exist. We have a million people today chasing 75,000 vacancies. There was a recognition that employment comes from the entrepreneurial small business sector of the community. Young unemployed people themselves said that the penalty rates seemed to be an unnecessary disincentive for people wanting to work. They said that unemployed people do not worry about weekends; the weekend is not sacred for those who do not have a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what can this Parliament do to create jobs&mdash;jobs that will ultimately be created only by small business, entrepreneurs and risk takers? The answer clearly lies in providing a new framework of policy and law to promote confidence, the lack of which has been a central cause of Australia's recent decline. We need to redefine the role of government. We need to tackle the task of Australia as a wider part of the world of trade and finance. We need a reform program based not on a blind faith in the market but on an understanding of the limits and capacities of the market. We need to continue to ensure that those in greatest need have those needs met. Finally, there was a strong view expressed that, as a result of these discussions, we need to unashamedly reverse policy to throw the balance back to productive people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing better illustrates this need than a recent letter I received from a lady operating a small business enterprise with her husband. I will precis some of her comments. She expresses alarm that many in the Federal Government, and their advisers, do not know what is going on amongst ordinary people in country Australia. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to operate under a clerical and administrative employees award. We see work definitions are rigid and relate to large businesses. There is little which relates to a small business where there is little formal structure, where tasks overlap and where everyone pitches in when necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>She refers to the tiered wage structure, and believes that the initial youth wage is too high. She talks about the 17 1/2 per cent holiday loading and says that she cannot see, and never has been able to, why anyone should be paid extra for going on holidays. She talks of the job destroying policy of compulsory, non-contributing superannuation. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allow me to make a special plea on behalf of the unemployed, especially the young. We advertised a position in March and we received 30 applications. We had occasion to advertise again in September and many of the applications were from the same people who applied in March. They were still unemployed, still writing applications, and some of them had not worked for two years. Their applications and interviews showed us that there are a lot of well-presented, eager, talented young people out there going to waste and gradually becoming bewildered and disillusioned because they have no tasks to put their hands and minds to each day. Then, of course, there are the ones on a training scheme, they receive on-the-job training for a year, the subsidy gets cut off and they are again out of a job.</PARA>
<PARA>She concludes by saying, on behalf of many tradesmen their firm deals with, that she protests about the requirement that they be taxed on the materials they use to complete a job. This was only part of a well-written and detailed letter that points to some of the changes that need to be made in our community to ensure that our young people have opportunities for employment, opportunities to work with dignity and opportunities to plan for a future. This is the challenge of the coalition's Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within its 660 pages is a full and detailed program for government on health, education, defence, social security, trade, industry, taxation and industrial relations. Through Fightback I believe that in government we will be able to stabilise Australia's national debt and reduce it. We can reduce unemployment and create productive employment. We can have low interest rates and a rising standard of living at the same time. We can give families hope and confidence in the future. We can have better schools, universities and health services, while at the same time protecting the environment, with stable economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No policy can be designed to fully satisfy the diverse and competing demands of the Australian electorate, but our package is not based on ignorant hyperbole: it is a new direction and radical change. It will achieve a change of attitude and transform the prospect for Australia and Australians. Most importantly, it crystallises the choice facing our people, and I believe the vast majority of Australians will be better off. It is not utopia, but it will certainly put us back on the road to recovery. </PARA>

Again, thousands of these people are coming to volunteer centres, where they can have an interview to try to match their skills and the sorts of things they would like to do, and they are plugged into agencies who need volunteers. The beauty of volunteer referral agencies is not that they attract all people who want to do volunteering through their organisation&mdash;they probably handle only 1 or 2 per cent of the number of volunteers who do their work day in day out in Australia&mdash;but they do provide the opportunity to monitor the work and the conditions under which volunteer effort is undertaken to make sure that paid work is not being replaced or displaced by volunteers in those various service agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The volunteer referral centres have rules about how many hours a volunteer should be used in a particular service agency. So, for instance, anyone working more than about 16 hours a week as a volunteer in a given agency should not be regarded as a volunteer but should be put on the payroll. Those sorts of rules of the volunteer referral agencies are similar to the Commonwealth Government's rules in as much as we allow a person who is on a Job Search allowance, an unemployment beneficiary, to work only up to about 20 hours a week in volunteer work because, essentially, those people have to make themselves available for work at all times. They must be actively seeking a job. But we do not deny them the ability to work as volunteers and we are aware of the great good it does unemployed people if they can get into some volunteer work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to correct a comment made today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> by Sue Dunleavie who interviewed me and talked about the unemployed being referred by the CES to these referral centres. That is not a position I take at all; it is a mistake in the article. What I would like to see is, where there are unemployed people seeking to use their skills and looking for organisations where they can become involved, those people contacting a volunteer referral centre in their city and being assured that they will be spoken to by a skilled person who can refer them to a volunteer agency which can make best use of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other good work that the volunteer referral centres do is to say to agencies like Red Cross, for instance, which is the one that is most familiar to us, `Are you getting best use of your volunteers? Do you know how to manage several hundred people who might, year in and year out, volunteer their services with your organisation?'. So the skills of people at the volunteer centres should be such that they are able to get maximum use out of volunteer effort. There have been those in recent days, like the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, who suggest that we should have schemes for unemployed youth whereby, in return for their dole, they do volunteer work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The High Court case is obviously quite complex and will require careful study by the Commonwealth  before we can make a detailed comment on its implications. I think it is worth saying that the court's decision does not challenge the granting of freehold or leasehold title over much of Australia, as some people have feared it might, and it does not interfere with private property rights of this kind. It does finally quash the outrageous notion of terra nullius, which, as Professor Henry Reynolds has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . was surely the distinctive and unenviable contribution of Australian jurisprudence to the history of relations between Europeans and the indigenous people of the non-European world to deny the right, and even the fact, of possession to people who had lived on the land for 40,000 years.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a notion that the dispossession of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders was justified because they had no notion of property or because their use of the land did not seem to be in accordance with the biblical injunction to replenish the earth and be fruitful. In other words, if they were not operating to the norm as we as European settlers understood it, they were in a position of not having any notion of property and the whole notion of dispossession was a justified one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the Mabo decision the Australian law has taken a major step away from this injustice and has finally entered the mainstream of world opinion. As a nation we are now far better prepared psychologically to proceed with the process of reconciliation. With this decision one more barrier&mdash;historically, perhaps the greatest barrier&mdash;has been effectively removed and the foundations of discrimination and prejudice have been kicked away. At least, that is what I am sure all members in this House hope and want to see pursued in the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the ceremony last week to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, if we wish to lay claim to being a truly civilised, advanced nation, the arrogance, ignorance and complacency which for so long characterised our attitudes, our policies and our law will have to go. We should consider how much it will do for our self-esteem and our own national self-confidence if we ourselves can eradicate this injustice and prejudice. I think this decision will make the task much easier and, therefore, I believe, will be welcomed by most Australians.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the document that was produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which, amongst a whole wealth of other information, has a discussion on the impact on equality of various government measures&mdash;whether they be taxation measures, the provision of services through government expenditures or the provision of other kinds of direct government benefits. The study concludes that both direct government benefits, such as welfare payments, and the provision of services, such as expenditure on education and other things, play a very significant role in redirecting income from the wealthy to the less well-off in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes on to say in relation to taxation that indirect taxation of the kind involved in consumption taxes, excises and other kinds of taxes generally make a contribution towards increasing inequality; whereas direct taxation, via income tax and so on, has a neutral effect on the question of equality. Coming as it does in the midst of a public debate about redistribution of income and the impact of taxation and government expenditure on the redistribution issues, this publication obviously makes a very important contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that the Opposition will welcome the  publication of this document because, despite its protestations and its urging of a full and wholesome debate about these issues, whenever there is anything which contests the Opposition's view of the world, it runs away from the debate and simply tries to destroy the authors of such publications.

So, along with the Reserve Bank, the ABC, the Federal Treasury and others, I am sure the ABS will come in for a stinging rebuke for daring to say that, if you cut welfare expenditure, cut education expenditure and impose a consumption tax, this is likely to have a deleterious effect on equality&mdash;rather than collecting taxation through direct taxes or extending benefits in a direct way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point was made very clearly by Ross Gittins back in November when he said that the Opposition's attempt to portray its proposals as being advantageous to Australian households was in fact a deceit. Mr Gittins said that the felony was compounded by the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to acknowledge the limitations of the tables in his publications and that it was a deliberate attempt to mislead. The reason why it is a deliberate attempt to mislead is that it excludes from any calculation the impact of the $6.5 billion worth of expenditure cuts that the Opposition intends to visit upon Australian households.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give the House an absolute assurance that in the context of the Government's sale of Qantas it would be very concerned to protect the national interest in matters such as those referred to by the honourable member for Dobell. This can be done by way of a special or golden share, which would prevent the amendment of the company's articles of association in certain respects without the approval of the Government. That is a common mechanism adopted by governments around the world to protect their perceived national interests in the context of privatising government business enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The type of national interest safeguards the Government intends to implement in this way include requirements that the trading name `Qantas' be retained for international air transport passenger services provided by the company; that the head office of Qantas remain in Australia; that foreign ownership of voting equity be restricted to 35 per cent; that a majority of members of the Qantas board be Australian citizens; and that the company retain its main operational base in Australia. Provisions such as those are very much in the national interest. They will ensure that Qantas remains in every respect an Australian company, the majority Australian owned, Australian based, and substantially operated from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the limitation of 35 per cent on foreign ownership is also important in respect of our international air service agreements with other countries. With any higher percentage of foreign ownership it could be possible for other countries to refuse to accept Qantas as an Australian carrier under those agreements and so refuse it a right to services into those countries. So we are very much concerned to protect the national interest in this way in the context of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, of course, has been pretending that it also has that concern. When we announced this change of policy earlier this week it ran a piece of paper around the press gallery entitled, `What is an Aussie share?'. This piece of paper apparently dates back quite some time. It was put out by `Warwick Smith, MP, shadow Minister for privatisation', which I think goes back to about February of last year.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question which dealt with the status of the AMA schedule. Under Medicare, the system of rebates is based on the Medicare benefits schedule. The schedule fee for rebatable items is set by the Government and reviewed annually. In 1986 the AMA decided to opt out of this process. The AMA now sets its own schedule, the purpose of which is to state what it believes to be the appropriate fee for particular items of service. It is well known that the AMA schedule fee is, on average, 30 per cent higher than the medical benefits schedule. For example, a standard consultation is $23.50 under the medical benefits schedule and $31 under the AMA schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer then is that the AMA schedule has no role to play under Medicare. It would seem that there are different views, and certainly a different view on the part of the Opposition.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those taking out private health insurance, full medical cover up to the AMA schedule level, subject to certain patient co-payments, will be allowed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that I go to that last point: the concern for the chronically ill having no protection under the policy announced by the coalition. I draw attention to that point, because clearly the policy of those opposite makes no policy with respect to the safety net. According to their policy documents, the maximum co-payment per item will be $30 and the maximum co-payment per annum will be $300 per family. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What remains very unclear in terms of that so-called safety net is what it actually means and how it will be determined. For example, would it be calculated as the difference between the medical benefits schedule and the Medicare rebate, as is currently the case, albeit with 75 per cent rather than 85 per cent of the medical benefits schedule, as it is under our policy? Would it be the difference between the AMA schedule fee and the Medicare rebate? Remember that the AMA schedule fee, a much higher fee, and the rebate are lowered to 75 per cent, and therefore quite a massive co-payment would be the responsibility of people. Or would it be the difference between the fee charged and the level to which a person is insured?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to cases in which there is a significant payment, in which hundreds of dollars might be involved, and in which there might be a question mark over any incentive to move towards private insurance at all, if that is what the policy means. The Opposition is unable to answer these questions, because effectively we are not talking about a real policy; we are talking about statements that vary according to the interest group and do not stand up to any objective analysis. It is a policy born of trying to satisfy every vested interest group by telling them what they want to hear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the detail of the policy, one sees no answers. We have seen the Opposition Leader go along with his friends at the AMA and promise them a 30 per cent pay rise&mdash;in Hobart, Tasmania, 30 per cent; there is a rather different view in Burnie. Then his spokesman comes along and directly contradicts his Leader by saying that the AMA schedule will not be endorsed. Despite what the honourable member for Lowe says, the coalition has done a cosy deal with the AMA to lift doctors' incomes. That deal will cost every Australian who needs a doctor, and that is why Australians will reject the Opposition and what is a very reckless health policy.</PARA>

On 24 August 1983 the Leader of the Government in the Senate stated that irrespective of any undertaking by the previous Government, the Government had decided that responses to parliamentary committee reports would be made by way of a ministerial statement in Parliament. Furthermore, the period in which responses were to be made would be reduced from six months to three months. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament will be considered the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) asked a question with a number of detail issues about moneys being paid through EMDG grants to education exporters in this country and the relationship of that to any debts they might have with the Commonwealth. I promised that I would try to get an answer as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised, therefore, that in 1990-91 Austrade received 143 claims for the promotion of educational services in overseas markets. These claimants were granted grants of $30m and generated export earnings in the year of more than $274m. Among these 143 claims were some for English language colleges which provide courses to overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training, with the cooperation of the Australian Government Solicitor, is seeking to recover payments made by the Commonwealth to overseas students on behalf of a number of these institutions. A task force, called the China Task Force, has been established to facilitate the recovery of funds. Representatives of the task force and the Australian Government Solicitor are due to meet with Austrade on 5 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade has received a list of institutions which are involved in the recovery action. A number of these institutions have claimed and received benefits under the export market development grants scheme. Because of Austrade's status as a statutory corporation, it is not possible for a grant payment to be offset against a debt to the Commonwealth without the consent of the claimant under section 12(2) of the Export Market Development Grants Act. I would like to reiterate that EMDG entitlements are payable if an applicant satisfies the criteria according to the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Act (No. 2) 1990. As I said yesterday, that Act was passed in this House and in the Senate with the support of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Kooyong is no doubt aware, the financial or legal position of an applicant at the time of application is not deemed irrelevant criterion for eligibility under the Act. Nonetheless, my colleague the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) has written to the Austrade Chairman asking that the Austrade board consider the policy question of the financial status of a firm or individual applying for an EMDG grant. In this letter, he pointed out that he was not requesting a review of the scheme in total. He stressed that he is concerned to maintain the effectiveness, equity and administrative simplicity of the scheme, as well as its non-discretionary nature. I understand that the Chairman of Austrade has indicated that he has set processes in train to expedite the Minister's request and will be reporting to the Minister after the Austrade board has considered advice on the matter.</PARA>

In the last few days we have seen early evidence of just how true that assessment was. This man, under the pressure of events of the last few weeks, went on television last weekend and made a whole string of new policy announcements. He has changed his mind a multitude of times in the course of the last few days, yet he has the hide to stand up and say that he is bringing about a revolution in policy.

He is not sure of what is coming next. Day after day for weeks on end there has been question after question about the involvement of his senior Ministers, his closest mates and his numbers men, in the Marshall Islands affair and all its ramifications, which have now spread from Western Australia, north to Hong Kong, east to the Marshall Islands and south to Victoria.

He was in a state of panic by the time he got to the end of last week in Parliament because he had had such a horrific week in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to some of the issues that the Prime Minister has backed in the past few months while he has been the Leader. They have all gone bad on him. Do honourable members remember <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, the document that the Prime Minister brought down? We polled One Nation. Do honourable members know what people think One Nation is about? They think it about changing the flag and getting rid of the Queen! The Prime Minister did such a successful job of bringing down a policy package for Australia that people out there think it has something to do with changing the flag and getting rid of the Queen, but nothing to do with dealing with the fundamental problems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence has now emerged that the One Nation promises are undeliverable; the tax cuts cannot be made; there is a $23 billion hole; this year's Budget deficit is twice what it was predicted to be, and will probably turn out to be higher. He has had no support from the Premiers. He has had no support from the unions for any of his One Nation initiatives. The whole package has just been blown apart by one failure after another in the past few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is under real pressure. The polls are slipping. He is seen to have no policy response. He has been unable to neutralise Fightback in any way. He knows that if he polls it, support for it will continue to rise, irrespective of what he says and does and irrespective of the number of inane comments we hear from his Ministers in answers to dorothy dix questions in this Parliament. He has achieved nothing in his time as Prime Minister, except to put the Labor Party and its electoral standing back where it was when the Party decided to elect him as Leader and to get rid of Bob Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a couple of particular areas on which we saw policy decisions this week, in relation to the aviation industry and pay TV, he was in a mess. He had a real problem that was festering away and that he had to deal with. The Government announced that it would sell 49 per cent of Qantas and 100 per cent of Australian Airlines. But it was not going very well. The Government wasted the best part of two years with no substantive offers on the table, no capacity to deal with it, and both airlines in trouble. The full motivation for the changes this week was, in part, not only to get out from under that overt policy failure but also to hide the full extent of the financial difficulties, which undoubtedly will emerge in coming months, of those companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to pay TV, the Prime Minister lost his guru&mdash;that bloke Richo, who had been talking to Kerry Packer at length and who had a very clear understanding of what Packer wanted from pay TV. In fact, Richo went to the media and referred to the extent to which Packer wanted to have a share in the new pay TV vehicles. Richo had gone, and the Prime Minister was under pressure to deliver something, to bring in a decision in the rush to the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons&mdash;his One Nation failure; the flag debate that went against him; the fall in the polls; the fact that those two particular issues are running against him&mdash;he thought he had to do something. So with a clear sense of forward looking direction and planning that we would expect from a Prime Minister, he panicked on Saturday morning or Friday night&mdash;probably Friday night&mdash;got hold of Laurie Oakes, and said, `Mate, I have to come on your program. I will make some major announcements. Give me a couple of soft lobs in the first couple of questions, and I will give you a story that will run for a week'. That is what happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister went on television. He announced a completely new approach to three areas of policy: aviation, TAFE colleges, and pay TV. Those policies were announced and they ran in the media for most of Sunday afternoon and into Monday morning. And that is about as long as they lasted. As every day went on, we got another policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thinking back, we have had three pay TV policies. Interestingly, we started out with the Packer option of a 45 per cent shareholding in the next licensee. That is just a coincidence of course&mdash;but that was the position he announced on television on Sunday morning. That went down to 35 per cent and then to zero&mdash;going, going, gone&mdash;so it has absolutely no role in it at all. It is absolutely ridiculous. We have had three separate pay TV policies in the space of three days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of TAFE colleges, again, we have had three separate policies in this period and we have had two airline policies. On Sunday the Prime Minister was going to sell 70 per cent of the combined vehicle and now we hear he is going to sell 100 per cent of it. He has no sense of direction, no policy agenda and no understanding of what is required in order to get this country out of the mess into which he has put it. He has only a demonstrated capacity to manipulate issues for short term political ends. He is a classic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister was asked about this today in the Parliament. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked him about some of his positions on the record. The Prime Minister changes his position like he changes his Italian suits. He does not pay any attention to what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. He does not care about due process. He could not care less about how decisions ought to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His office is a shambles. The public servants and his colleagues cannot get into his office. In fact, he is probably up there now having his afternoon siesta after Question Time. I am told that every day he has to lie down and have a sleep after the strain and nervousness of the fever in here and he cannot be interrupted for the best part of an hour. That is where he would be right now, rather than in here taking this debate. But he is up there&mdash;fragile little petal that he is&mdash;lying down having a bit of a snooze and nobody can get to him. He and his advisers run the country from the confines of that office, the plane, the car, or wherever they happen to be. There is no due process, no thought process and no understanding of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no better example of that than the way the pay television decision was taken. This was described in graphic detail by Senator `Shat' or Schacht. I am never quite sure how you say that but I will say Schacht because `Shat' is not very nice. Senator Schacht gave a very clear-cut description of exactly how the decision was taken in the course of an early morning meeting. At about 2 a.m., I am told, we had about the twenty-seventh manifestation of the pay TV decision. I have told honourable members about three of them; we know about those. But there were undoubtedly a string of others, as they went in and out of Cabinet, Caucus and subcommittees. So there they were at 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;it was effectively a poker game, with Prime Minister Keating laying down the cards, turning over the cards&mdash;dealing with the future of the pay television industry as if it were a poker game. This morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio program Senator Schacht was asked, `Exactly how did this policy emerge; where did this version three that we know about come from?'. He replied:</PARA>

He is the guy who is supposed to be taking it. Who is Schacht anyway? What was he doing in there? He is a factional leader, is he not? He is one of the boys. Keating is one of his boys. And this is what Keating has relied on. He has relied on the fact that they will have to give him something. They cannot let him make a complete fool of himself going on TV on Sunday morning. They are going to have to give him something, because, after all, they put him there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, Schacht was in there and he was asked about what the Minister thought of the proposal. He said, `I must say, when he put it, Bob Collins'- that is, the Minister&mdash;`who was at the meeting, looked absolutely stunned'. The Minister was there; he did not know a thing about it. Senator Schacht said he `looked absolutely stunned because he hadn't heard of this proposal'. He was going to say `in detail', but he said `in any way'. He had not heard of this proposal in any way. The Prime Minister's staff had not heard of it. So it was something that he had created laterally as part of the committee. He was probably still having his siesta; still on his back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That describes the way this Prime Minister and his colleagues make a major decision about a major new industry in this country: `I double dog dare you', `You are on', and off they go.

It is a country with great wealth, great opportunity, great national resources, desperately needing leadership in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years; and what we have is a double dog dare with a factional leader in the Prime Minister's office at 2 o'clock in the morning to determine a policy that the Minister knows nothing about and the Public Service has not been consulted about. It is little wonder that the Government goes from bad to worse. </PARA>

It is not concerned with the way in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes policy, it is not concerned with the content of the One Nation statement, and it is not concerned with the policies related to TAFE. Those opposite have no such policies&mdash;as far as TAFE is concerned there is nothing in the Fightback policy promising a darn thing&mdash;and they come in here saying that there is a policy problem in that area on this side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue arises from one thing and one thing only. Although these MPIs come on after Question Time, they are always prepared after the previous Question Time and before the one on the day on which they appear. Yesterday in Question Time a silly strategy being pursued by the Opposition to smear and slander the Government came dramatically unstuck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had the temerity to refer again in his remarks to the supposed investments of the Prime Minister, when he had one of his monkeys jump up here yesterday to ask a question of the Prime Minister on the subject of returns associated with those companies and discovered to his horror&mdash;he is not a complete idiot; he obviously did not know himself, or he would never have permitted the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) to ask a question like that&mdash;that the returns on his own companies had been late three successive years in a row, and those of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) twice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had Opposition characters on the benches, when the Prime Minister was answering that particular question, screaming out to the Prime Minister that he ought to resign on the strength of a late return in relation to one company that the Prime Minister is associated with. Fortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, as is demonstrated in the way Fightback has been developed, he is deaf to his back bench, so he probably was not able to hear those particular remarks at that time. The embarrassment would have been very severe for him indeed had he done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition says that he has surveyed Fightback, and indeed there are surveys of Fightback. There is one thing everybody knows about Fightback, and it is the only worthwhile thing knowing about it: the intention to introduce a 15 per cent tax on all goods and services in this country.

There is a picture of the lady being a prisoner in her own home, according to the Opposition's Fightback obfuscation pamphlet. And what do we get? We get the same lady. She has managed to get out of the house. The same lady who is sitting there, locked and barred in her house&mdash;she is not allowed out because of the heinous policies of the Labor Party&mdash;has nevertheless managed to escape out of the house to find herself associated with somebody, where she next appears at the supermarket, who would wish to pick her pocket. She is out there with Dr Hewson, telling him what a terrific thing the Fightback plan is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite keep kidding themselves by saying, `We are going to create a huge plethora of jobs'. Let us get honest about where Fightback would lead on the jobs front. Under the propositions in Fightback there is an assumption in the three years of operation that unemployment levels would continue around 10 per cent. There is no escaping that. That is in the package: unemployment levels will continue around 10 per cent for three years. What is supposed to happen to the people who find themselves unemployed in that period? As those opposite have no doubt noticed, three years is a bit longer than nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have another interesting proposition as far as the unemployed are concerned&mdash;I point out that this is a worthwhile one for the people, the Parliament, the Government and everyone else to consider&mdash;and it concerns the qualification for the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will point out one of the fundamental elements of restructuring. The Opposition says it is about micro-economic reform. We actually know about it because we have gone through restructuring processes&mdash;as I have occasion to know, having been a Minister in three portfolios responsible for very substantial restructuring and the creation of very much more efficient industries in this country. There is one essential accompaniment to restructuring. Almost invariably where there are changes to work practices, where industrial efficiencies are introduced, there will be redundancies. We cannot escape that. That is an inevitable consequence of structural change. We cannot run away from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what Opposition spokesmen might think, people do not run straight from the factory into other employment. Redundancy packages are negotiated so that people are capable of maintaining a particular lifestyle&mdash;their debt structure or whatever they might be involved in at that moment&mdash;while they go looking for work. Now, as they do that, they receive the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell honourable members what the Opposition's proposition is. Given its strategies, probably even more important than the nine-month period before people will get put off the unemployment benefit is the period of time before they can get put on it. As far as the Opposition is concerned, those redundancy packages will have to be exhausted at a determined rate&mdash;which the Department of Social Security points out is probably one-third slower than the rate at which those redundancy packages would actually be expended. So that money would not be there in people's back pockets, to pay off their debts and maintain their lifestyle while they are on the unemployment benefit and looking for something else. What people in those industries that the Opposition would restructure further have to contemplate is that they will walk out and find themselves in a situation where they are not able to take the unemployment benefit. They must spend the entirety of their redundancy package before they pick up the unemployment benefit. If at the end of nine months they qualify for special benefit and they have anything left of the redundancy package, the qualification for special benefit absolutely requires them to dispense of savings and a considerable proportion of their assets. Those opposite cannot run away from that either because that is the requirement for special benefit under their proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It disgusts me when members such as the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) and the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this place and talk about unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition has been talking about the Marshall Islands and has been deceiving the public about his company returns for the last week or so. He has not been talking about unemployment. He always uses the word `unemployment' as a throwaway line. It absolutely disgusts me that those people can stand in this place and criticise us about unemployment while in their back pockets they have a policy which admits a 10 per cent level of unemployment in the first three years of the implementation of Fightback and carries with it a determination on their part to torment those people going out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that the attitudes of those opposite on unemployment are of a piece with a view in the community that is years and years old&mdash;that is, that somehow or other quite a lot of people on unemployment benefit are undeserving and that they ought to be forced off them in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where unemployment is associated with substantial restructuring, breadwinners with skills, but skills no longer in demand, are finding themselves unemployed. It is utterly essential that, firstly, they be supported when they are in those circumstances. At the time when those opposite were in office a person in such a position was on 60 per cent of average weekly earnings; now a person in such a position is on 80 per cent of average weekly earnings. As I have said, firstly those people have to be supported and, secondly, they have to be found an opportunity to retrain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How dare the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this place and criticise our vocational education and training policy when his proposition&mdash;because he has no room for it in Fightback&mdash;is to cut effectively $500m off the vocational education and training budget. If that is not his proposition, I am prepared to hear another argument. If it is not his proposition, where does he find the extra $500m for Fightback?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are simple questions, but they require answers. There are central policy issues in this country that have to be confronted by the electorate prior to the next election. The Prime Minister has put forward to the country a proposition on TAFE which will substantially change vocational education opportunities in this country for the better. Why is it that the Opposition wants to rip that off? I say to those opposite: do not come into this place making a mockery of the Prime Minister's negotiation of this with the States when you sit there mocking vocational education and training by your refusal to devote any resources to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposition on education is this: no additional money for vocational education and training but a $25m a year cut; and an 80 per cent increase in outlays for the wealthiest schools in this country. In so far as Opposition members have an education policy, that is it; that is all there is to it. So do not go talking to us about whether or not we are capable of making sensible policy in this place. When it comes to policy formulation, and the intention of honourable members opposite to persecute ordinary people in this country, they are absolute disgraces, every last one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are absolute disgraces when it comes to the security of people in this country. We are about security. What does security mean? Security means that people's homes are protected; yet those opposite want to cut 5 per cent off the police force. Security means that we have defence forces adequate to protect this country; yet those opposite want to cut $200m off defence. Security means that there will be education and training opportunities for school children when they leave school; yet those opposite want to reduce TAFE training opportunities. Security means that people will have access to award wages to protect their families and their lifestyles; yet those opposite wish to eliminate the protection of awards. Security means that when people find themselves unemployed and they have to protect the position of their families they are able to find benefits to protect them and to maintain their lifestyles. Above all, security means that people have access to a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding Fightback, the great deception, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned he said that  there were two million jobs. When asked whether those two million jobs incorporated an analysis of the GST, he said no. The model associated with those two million jobs mentioned nothing about GST. It is a bogus model. There are no two million jobs in Fightback. All there is is a nasty tax placed upon the ordinary people of this country so that the wealthy may benefit. It is as simple as that&mdash;a tax placed on ordinary people so the wealthy may benefit&mdash;no jobs. The only jobs that will be created will be those created by this side of the House, as they have been in the past&mdash;over the last 10 years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recognising the key role of TAFE in the national training arrangements, the Liberal and National Parties undertake to ensure that the growth of TAFE is adequately supported, and to this end undertake to increase the funding by $75m a year above current commitments, or $450m to fund growth in TAFE over the remaining years of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the answer to the Minister. I note that currently there is not a Minister in the formal part of the chamber. That is the contempt with which those opposite treat this Parliament. They do not even debate the facts of the publication. Here it is, in black and white, released last November, and stating categorically that there will be a $450m boost for technical and further education and, indeed, a $3 billion boost for education more generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister went on to raise the crime issue and conveniently overlooked a quote from last weekend. I think it is one that I should bring to the attention of the House. It is from the Victorian Police Commissioner, Mr Kel Glare. In the scheme of State police commissioners, he is one we should take a little notice of. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is our crime rate increasing?</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked if he knew why, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not sure I do. Clearly unemployment is a factor.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the response of the Victorian Police Commissioner&mdash;that unemployment is a factor in the increase in crime. That is one of the many reasons why, in contrast, we want to create jobs; we want to create the framework for jobs; we want to abolish payroll tax, sales tax and fuel excise tax. We want to abolish those three big taxes at the time we introduce a goods and services tax to tilt the economy back in favour of the productive sector to generate jobs, and to provide the recipe for generating jobs which in fact the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when Treasurer in 1985, spent several months arguing for. Indeed, let me quote him yet again when he said in very clear-cut terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia faces a clear choice. It must proceed down the path&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He was arguing for option C. He argued very strongly for a consumption tax in 1985. His words are there in chapter and verse. He said he believed that if Australia missed that opportunity for tax reform it would never ever be tackled again. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot delude ourselves that we can achieve fundamental economic and social reform if we allow ourselves to be continuously saddled with a tax system that has become more and more unfair, inequitable and inefficient.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were the views of the Treasurer and also Mr Hawke at the Tax Summit in 1985. That is when they had a bit of courage for a brief period and were able to say, `Australia has got a problem with its tax system; Australia has a badly distorted tax system. We are going to have a go at challenging it'. So they convened the Tax Summit, and what happened? They all went to water. A deal was done with the ACTU and one opportunity to bring about tax reform seven years ago along the path of what most Asian economic tigers have already done departed the scene. The result is that we are now in a recession that is far worse than it needed to be. We went into recession ahead of the rest of the world. We are in a deeper recession than the rest of the world, and our recovery from that recession is more fragile than that of the rest of the world. </PARA>

I spend a lot of time reading newspapers while travelling around the country most weekends to attend functions. The article particularly commends itself. I refer to that very important publication, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, of Sunday, 31 May. The article entitled `On My Own', written by Bill Mandle, states:</PARA>

<PARA>The quote goes on, but I would be too embarrassed to read it further. I know that it would upset the honourable member for Kingston, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table. I simply say to the House that it is stating the obvious: it is stating that the Liberal and National parties in two years have welded together a policy package and a team approach which is a real alternative to the shambles that represents the Government's policy process, which is the subject of the matter of public importance being considered this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy process is all about policy shambles.

Being able to think of nothing better to say to our present Prime Minister, he turned around and said to his new young Minister of six weeks, `Keating, you're sacked'. He did not allow for the fact that he, Mr Whitlam, then Prime Minister, had also been sacked.

Let us contrast that with the nine years of delay that the Government has brought to a mini micro-economic reform policy matter going to a reasonably important part of our tourism industry infrastructure and our aviation industry infrastructure. I refer to the third runway at Mascot. That was under way. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) had signed the paperwork and an agreement had been reached with the New South Wales State Government, but when the government changed, the new Government cancelled the project. Six years later, in 1989, the Government had the courage to re-announce it. Three years after that, we still have not had one tonne of dirt moved for the construction of that third runway. That is policy stagnation. </PARA>

Because of all those things, what has happened? The Leader of the Opposition, in his 15 minutes, made sarcastic personal attacks on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Ha, ha! That is supposed to be the substitute for policy, for decision making and for leading this country. Why is he doing this? For two very important reasons: he has no answers whatever to the problems confronting this country, and the policy he put forward last November&mdash;the so-called Fightback package&mdash;has been totally discredited.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many Australian people want to see a 15 per cent tax on their food, clothing and the necessities of life? None! No Australian people want to see that. He knows it. Whatever those opposite do, no matter how many ways they try to sneak around and avoid the fact, the Australian people will not be deceived. Those opposite say, `We're going to reduce some other little taxes'. So they reduce some other little taxes, and impose a huge 15 per cent on everything. Then they have the gall to attack us after we have made big policy decisions in this crucial week&mdash;decisions which they never made when they were in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they were in government, their idea of an airline policy was to comfortably bring the two airlines together and say, `Here is a two-airline agreement. Don't worry about competition'. Prices of air fares kept going up and up. When this Government came in, it brought in a revolution in airline policy, and that revolution is continuing. Prices will plummet further and there will be much better air services for this great continent. We announced that this week. The Leader of the Opposition does not even have the basic decency to say, `This is a pretty good decision; this is something we have been waiting for'. He did not ask one single question in Question Time all this week on these issues, and then he gets up here and attacks the Prime Minister in personal terms with sarcastic comments on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition cracked jokes such as, `We are going to have a revolution in policy'. He thought having a revolution in policy was to be a joke. Those opposite will laugh at anything when he speaks. I say this to the Australian people: the Australian Liberal Party is considered a joke around the world because it is the most extreme right wing major party in the Western world. If this Party and its policies were in Europe, they would be considered equivalent to Le Pen and extremist parties in France and other such places. Not even decent conservative parties would dare put forward these extremist policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the policy that has led to the disaster at APPM in Burnie, the policy of the Opposition. It is that unions and employers are not to negotiate&mdash;lock out the unions and have no negotiations; sack people on the spot. That is the sort of industrial relations that the Opposition Leader has put into Fightback. We can imagine what would happen. It would make the first two years of the Thatcher Government in Britain, when there was a huge explosion of industrial conflict in the whole of Britain, appear to be a holiday. That is what would happen if this Opposition were to be elected and allowed to implement that terrible industrial relations policy. Through their policy, those opposite want to cut the working conditions and wages of all Australian workers. There is no doubt about that. As if that were not enough, they want to impose a 15 per cent tax on the basic necessities of life. After doing all of that, they come in here and say, `You don't have any answers'. </PARA>

By next year, when the economy has picked up, when we are going to the people at an election and when all those opposite have to offer is a 15 per cent tax, we will see whether those opposite are smirking as they are today. But that will not be happening. Instead, the honourable member for Wentworth will not be Leader of the Opposition. There will be an alternative Leader of the Opposition, because the Liberal Party will not be prepared to go to that electoral disaster that he is leading them into.

<PARA>If anything is clear, it is that the Keating prescriptions are based on a long term strategy. Let us have a look at our policy on TAFE. The TAFE policy is determined, never mind the technicalities, to create tens of thousands of jobs for young people beginning in the TAFE system next year. The Federal Government will take control of the TAFE system from the States and it will supervise the system to ensure all of those positions in vocational education for all of our young people. That is a clear policy prescription that will help our young people become a skilled work force. Is that not a long term policy prescription? Of course it is. It is looking beyond the recession at what we are going to be doing with our young people in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has come in here and suggested that, because there have been some technical changes to the policy this week, this constitutes some back flip or some dramatic failure. Just because the Fightback package is totally inflexible and is from a totally inflexible Leader who has been asked to change his policy, it does not mean that we in the Labor Party proceed in the same fashion. We in the Labor Party proceed on the basis of discussion. When we determine that there are areas which need to be amended, we amend them. When we get representations from the people, we accept those representations. We do not say, `Here is an inflexible document', as though it were some kind of Bible, which the Fightback package purports to be. </PARA>

Instead of focusing on the actual achievement, he is saying that, because there were some changes and some flexibility, this shows that there has not been a deliberative process. All that can be said is this: we are looking forward to the debate in the future, the improvement of the economy and the improvement of the employment situation.

Questions about the division of assets and possible cross-subsidisation of Medibank Private by Medicare have also arisen. The inquiry was brief. Only two submissions were received by the closing date: one from the Health Insurance Commission and one from the Australian Health Insurance Association. Each was subsequently invited to comment on the other's submission and the input of the Australian National Audit Office was also sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having considered the evidence presented, the Committee was persuaded that the current cost apportionment system meets the requirements of predicability, administrative simplicity and equity in the distribution of total costs between Medicare and Medibank Private. While some preciseness at the lowest level of costs may be sacrificed, the Committee is satisfied that the present system accurately and fairly distributes total costs between the two functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was not persuaded by the evidence presented to the inquiry that cross-subsidisation occurs. It noted in this regard that the Health Insurance Commission, Medibank Private and Medicare are subject to regular audit by the Australian National Audit Office. The auditing process includes scrutiny of the cost apportionment and asset rental systems. If instances of cross-subsidisation were noted by the audit process, they would be reported by the Australian National Audit Office to the Parliament. In the absence of such reports, the Committee was unable to substantiate allegations of cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes, however, that this inquiry did not consider the broader questions raised by the Australian Health Insurance Association. These include the viability of Medibank Private and the extent to which it complies with the requirements of the National Health Act. Similarly, questions of policy as to whether Medicare should reimburse the Commissioner of Taxation, for example, for collection costs fell outside the scope of the present inquiry. A separate inquiry could address these issues. Despite the brevity of the inquiry and the report, the Committee considers that the process has been a valuable one, as it has a provided a forum in which these longstanding concerns could be aired and counter argument presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Committee, I thank the secretariat staff for its assistance with the inquiry, in particular Richard Cavanagh, Geraldine Skinner and Yolanda Campagna.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the pleasure, at very short notice, of being invited to be a member of the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Yaounde in the Republic of Cameroon. My job was made much easier by the fact that the deputy leader of the delegation was the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), and we were ably supported in our efforts by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), as members of the delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on record our appreciation, first of all, to the host group from the Parliament of the Republic of Cameroon not only for providing their parliamentary buildings and support staff, but also for ensuring that the delegations of all countries represented at the IPU Conference in Yaounde had as pleasant and educational a conference as was possible. I would also like to place on record our appreciation of the support staff who assisted the delegation in its efforts&mdash;in particular, Mr John Dyer, who was the secretary of the delegation; Mr Bill Nelson, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Ms Bertha Williamson, from the Speaker's office, who assisted us in making a contribution to the conference. It would be remiss of me if I did not also express our appreciation to Australia's Ambassador to France and the support staff, such as Bernard Elias and others, who ensured that, in our half-day to a day transit in France, things went smoothly and, despite some difficulties, we were able to make all of our connections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issues which were discussed at the IPU conference at Yaounde concerned, first of all, the UNCED conference on the environment and development which is now taking place in Brazil and, secondly, the whole question of parliamentary democracy and the increasing tensions throughout the world due to ethnic differences throughout different communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the second time in two years the Australian delegation was successful in moving a supplementary item for discussion at the IPU. The deputy leader of the delegation might help me, but I think that was almost without precedent. I will let her speak at greater length on that matter, given the fact that she led the Australian delegation's efforts in not only having that matter successfully voted in as a supplementary item, but also in having the final text of the conference adopted unanimously. The supplementary item which was put forward by the Australian delegation concerned the AIDS virus, and, as I have said, I will let the honourable member for Moncrieff speak about that in more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I say on behalf of all members of the Australian delegation that I think we can hold our heads high. The Australian delegation contributed to all the debates that took place, and we had an opportunity to exchange ideas with members of IPU delegations from other countries. It was certainly an eye-opener to many of us in understanding some of the issues that were debated at the conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to this report of the Australian delegation to the Eighty-seventh Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in which it was my privilege to participate. I would like to point out a couple of things to this Parliament that it may not be totally aware of, since I know that not all honourable members have time to read reports such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian delegation from this Parliament to the Inter-Parliamentary Union now participates very substantially in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in addition to its actual participation in the conference. I point out to honourable members that our Speaker is a member of the International Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and is presently serving a four-year term. Because of his inability to attend this last conference, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) substituted for him at the meetings of the Executive Committee. The person who is normally the permanent Government representative on the IPU, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), is a member of the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians, which I think is far and away the most significant committee of that organisation. He is also a member of the Committee to Monitor the Situation in Cyprus. Unfortunately, he also was unable to attend this conference at short notice, and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) substituted for him on those two committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this last conference I was elected as one of the two representatives of the Asia-Pacific Group on the Coordinating Committee for Women Parliamentarians. The other delegate from the Asia-Pacific Group is a parliamentarian from Indonesia. She and I have agreed that we will split our responsibilities so that she will take the primary role for contact with women parliamentarians in Asia and I will take the primary role for contact with women parliamentarians in the Pacific. I mention that because at present the only Pacific countries attending Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences are Australia and New Zealand. I understand that Fiji has been a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in the past, but its membership is presently suspended because of the military coup of a few years ago. I certainly hope that, now that Fiji has held elections and has an elected government and Prime Minister, it will start to participate in meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very sad lack of input from the Pacific, for the principal reason that membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union is quite expensive and the cost of sending delegates to conferences is quite high. Most of the Pacific countries are small island states, and it is too big a financial burden for them to participate in the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Therefore Australia and New Zealand try to do their best to represent Pacific interests at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall be trying to do that in a very particular way in relation to women parliamentarians. I will be letting the women of the parliaments of the Pacific know that the interests of women parliamentarians are being advanced at Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences and that, although their countries are not participating in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it is open to them to make an input to the conference through me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dobell mentioned that we were successful in getting a supplementary item listed. At the conference in Santiago we were successful in getting listed a supplementary item on the subject of trade. I will mention as an aside, for the benefit of those honourable members who are not familiar with the report, that two subjects are listed for debate. Those subjects are determined by the Executive Committee at the preceding conference. A supplementary item is selected for debate among those items submitted at the conference. That supplementary item is selected by the conference at large on a vote of all countries. They decide what that supplementary item should be. If necessary, an emergency item can also can be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplementary item that Australia put forward was in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pandemic nature of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS):</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its threat to world economic growth and political and social stability, especially in the Third World;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of policies to transform scientific knowledge into public policy and social and political commitment to mitigate its effects.</PARA>
<PARA>That subject was proposed by Australia at the previous conference in Santiago to be one of the listed subjects at the conference in Yaounde. That proposal was not agreed to by the Executive Committee. In bringing it forward again for consideration as a supplementary item, we were very mindful that this would be our last opportunity to have the subject of AIDS and its threat to the world discussed by the world's parliamentarians. There was actually very strong&mdash;I do not know whether I should describe it as opposition&mdash;rivalry in regard to the listing of the supplementary item. In the end, it was won by only 15 votes. That is significant when we consider that there were 704 votes in favour. Therefore, a margin of only 15 votes is very small indeed out of more than 700 votes. I point out that each country can vote for every proposal, so it is not an either/or situation. It was a very close run thing. It was particularly gratifying that the matter received the greatest amount of support from countries at the conference and that no country voted against it, given that the Executive Committee had not given it much support at all when it was put forward as a set item at the previous conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many delegates spoke on the subject. As the person proposing that item, and as the person who led the discussion for Australia when it was debated, I was particularly gratified by the level of participation by other countries in the debate. Because it was a supplementary item, delegates did not come to the conference prepared to debate it. It was a spontaneous debate. It was a matter of what knowledge was contained within parliamentary delegations that determined the actual content of the debate. The debate was of a very high level. I was very impressed by the level of knowledge&mdash;in some cases, quite specialist knowledge&mdash;amongst a very broad range of delegates.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support for the motion was very broad, the exception being Latin American and Caribbean countries. None of the Caribbean countries supported it. Only one of the Latin American countries&mdash;Chile&mdash;did so. In debate, representatives of all countries, except the Caribbean countries and Latin America, spoke to the item. In the end a motion put to the conference was unanimously adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend to members that, if they do not want to take time out to read all the reports of IPU conferences, they at least read the resolutions from those conferences. They are resolutions that we have agreed to as a parliament. Honourable members may well be interested to see what the Australian Parliament has committed itself to, for example, specifically on the subject of AIDS and what responsibilities therefore lie on the Australian Parliament to pay attention to and take action on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that at this stage, compared with other countries, not very many Australians have been infected with the HIV virus and comparatively few have died&mdash;and I say `comparatively', but it is a tragedy if anyone dies. In Africa millions of people have been infected. Nevertheless Australia is as threatened as any country can be, for a variety of reasons. I think that, with the resources Australia has, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that adequate resources are addressed to combatting this problem. Anyway, I will talk about that subject on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other things I want to say about the conference and our participation in the IPU. I have now attended four Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences. They were in Uruguay, Pyongyang, Santiago and Yaounde. When it was mentioned that this conference was in Yaounde, somebody in this chamber said, `Where is that?'. Where, indeed! We are not very familiar with Africa. I have mentioned those venues to show that going to an IPU conference is not exactly a junket to the fleshpots of the world. The venues are chosen for very different reasons indeed. They are actually chosen to try to do something about democracy throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I have listed these IPU conferences to inform the Parliament that Australia has been represented on drafting committees for topics discussed at every one of those conferences. In Uruguay we were active on the drafting committee, of only 10 or 11 members, on the subject of colonialism; in Pyongyang, on the subject of weapons of mass destruction; in Santiago, on a subject related to education and also on the supplementary item concerning trade&mdash;a subject which had been nominated by Australia; and in Yaounde, on the subject of AIDS. Together with those other committee responsibilities I have outlined, we have a very high profile at IPU conferences and a very active delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to mention one thing in relation to that. If I get the opportunity, I will mention it on future occasions also. I take this opportunity of doing so because this may well be the last IPU delegation of which I am a member. We do not know when the next Federal election will be. The next two IPU conferences are scheduled for Stockholm in September and India in April, and the conference after that will be here in Canberra in September of next year. The next two conferences are problematic for me. It is possible that we will have an election around those times, or before then. I explain all of that to say that what I am about to propose is not meant to be self-serving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went to my first conference, in Uruguay, there was no parliamentary member of that delegation with prior experience of an IPU conference. We were all in at the deep end, so to speak, and trying to find our way. It is very clear, as soon as one attends an IPU conference, that networking and knowing people are very important in terms of the role that Australia's delegation can play at a conference. Since Uruguay we have certainly become very active in promoting subjects and been successful in having them selected for discussion, and in being elected to positions through our participation. It is, however, a pity that there is that hiatus for the new parliament's first delegation. For example, after the next election the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and I will no longer be members of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be four brand new members going to the conference following the Federal election, whenever that may be. I would like to make a suggestion and then explain why I am making it now. I would like the IPU group and the Presiding Officers to consider the possibility that, for the first delegation after an election, the previous permanent members continue on, either as additional members of the delegation or in place of the two occasional members. At present we send two permanent delegates and two occasional delegates, the occasional members attending only one conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could have that degree of continuity, I believe it would be of great benefit to this Parliament's participation. The reason I feel free to make that suggestion is that, at least nominally, I am going to the conference in India anyway. If the suggestion were taken up, as the next conference would be in Canberra there would be no particular advantage or disadvantage in terms of members getting an overseas trip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the IPU and the Presiding Officers to turn their attention to how we might have a little more continuity. I know it can be said that the secretary of the delegation, Mr John Dyer, provides a degree of continuity&mdash;and that is true&mdash;but he is an officer of the delegation. It is the parliamentary members who attend any conferences who make decisions about what that delegation will do. They make them well in advance. For example, our delegation to the next conference in Sweden met this week to determine whether we would put forward a supplementary item for discussion or whether we want to put forward an item for listing on the conference agenda in India. Those decisions are made by parliamentarians. Whilst Mr Dyer can, and does, give advice, he cannot really give political advice and participate in political judgments; it is up to the parliamentary members to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join the honourable member for Dobell in thanking John Dyer, as secretary of the delegation, for all his hard work and support, which he always gives to every IPU delegation. I would also like to thank Bill Nelson, an adviser to the delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Bill is a very valuable member of the delegation. He is very prompt in giving advice on matters relating to Australia's foreign policy and in making suggestions in relation to members' speeches and actions that we take. I have always found his contribution to be a very valuable one. I would also like to thank Bertha Williamson from the Speaker's office, who was a participating and very helpful member of the delegation. In conclusion, I thank the honourable member for Dobell, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) and the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) for their assistance and support and, not least, for their very good company. I have no hesitation in saying that it is the happiest delegation I have travelled with. It was also very hardworking, and one that I will long remember. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would also like to join the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in making just a few brief comments about the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in the Republic of Cameroon. I, too, had the privilege of being part of that delegation. Two things that impressed me most about the delegation were the way in which it worked as a team, which included all the parliamentary members, and the impact that the Australian delegation was able to make in a major world forum. We must understand that the Inter-Parliamentary Union is a major world forum. I was particularly impressed with the impact that the Australian delegation made on the delegations from other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect I think particular congratulations ought to go to the honourable member for Dobell, who was thrown in at the deep end to lead the delegation, having been asked to do so at the eleventh hour because the Speaker was unable to fulfil that role. The honourable member for Dobell went about his task with dignity and certainty in representing Australia on the Executive Committee and in the other forums that he participated in. He worked very well with all the other members of the team, and I particularly congratulate him on the role he played at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like particularly to congratulate the honourable member for Moncrieff. Her role in promoting to the IPU the debate on the AIDS issue, which she has just explained, is of particular credit to her. It was her initiative at the Santiago conference that brought that matter forward. She pursued it again at the conference in Yaounde, despite the fact that many of the other delegations felt it was not the most appropriate issue for debate as a supplementary item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the great credit of the honourable member for Moncrieff, she pursued it vigorously, with determination and dedication, to the point where she was appointed as the raconteur to carry the item through the whole of the conference. She did it with great skill and dignity, and her efforts in pursuing that item brought great credit to Australia. All of the Parliament ought to be congratulating the honourable member for Moncrieff, because her efforts brought great credit to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Moncrieff has done, I would also like to thank the other members of the delegation. I have mentioned the honourable member for Dobell and the honourable member for Moncrieff. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), attending his first conference, participated very well in many of the forums and functions of the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particular thanks are also due to our delegation secretary, Mr John Dyer. John is a model of efficiency and dedication. He is one of those people who will not sleep at night until the last i's are dotted and the t's crossed. Particular thanks go also to Bertha Williamson from the Speaker's office, who played a valuable role in the way Australia presented its delegation to the conference, and to Mr Bill Nelson who, as the foreign affairs adviser to the delegation, from time to time was extremely helpful to me and other members of the delegation in preparing speeches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, Australia's participation at that conference certainly helped to enhance our reputation as one of the leading countries, if I can put it that way, in the world at these conferences. As the honourable member for Moncrieff has mentioned, the conference in September 1993 will be held here in Canberra. I urge all members of parliament, regardless of whether they are official delegates to that conference, to play some participating role, even if it is just hosting a delegation from another country, to get some understanding and feel of what the IPU is all about. It offers Australia a real opportunity to participate in world forums and to gain understanding of other countries and the members of parliament from other countries. I was proud to be a member of this delegation, and I am quite certain that the participation of that delegation did much to help enhance the reputation of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It might be repetitive, but I also join in thanking the staff that were provided to the delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference. As was said earlier, until all hours of the morning they were helping to type speeches and to ensure that members of the delegation kept to the agenda, attended meetings, and were generally aware of the mechanics behind the scenes in some of the votes that occurred. All three staff members have been mentioned earlier, and I certainly join in thanking them for their assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that should be said about the venue was that it was very fitting for a conference of this sort. In the past year or two we have seen fairly dramatic changes in the democratisation of the African continent, whether it has been the question of South Africa; of Zambia, where elections led to a change of government by a very peaceful means; or of some of the former Portuguese colonies on the west coast of Africa, where there has been a transition. The Republic of Cameroon was of interest to all of us. We arrived to attend an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference in a country that was going through that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The telling points were that there seemed to be a very open press. I thought it was particularly interesting that a speech by one of the Austrian delegates, denouncing what he perceived to be some continuation of censorship in the country, was shown on television that night. That is indicative of the changes that are occurring in the country. The Cameroons should also be thanked for the efforts that they put into running the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) on managing to get up the resolution in regard to AIDS. It is a central world issue. Often it is treated as a taboo subject by some elements. As the honourable member said earlier, I think that was reflected to some degree in the vote by Latin American countries. It was unfortunate that there were two conflicting and competing motions. Ours&mdash;concerning the question of AIDS&mdash;was a central one. It was quite ironic that we were helped in getting it up by the fact that some other countries, such as North Korea, the Middle Eastern powers and China, were terrified of the alternative, which was transparency in world arms trade. Those countries were deeply in earnest that the Australian motion should defeat the Canadian suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make the point that I had the perception before I went to the conference that it was, to some degree, a talkfest. On top of the important resolutions which were discussed&mdash;whether it be world trade, UNCTAD, the question of AIDS and so on&mdash;there was a great opportunity to discuss issues with other members from different countries and to get a better grasp of the realities of those situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week we have seen that Denmark has rejected a relationship with the rest of Europe. At the conference it was quite interesting to meet the leader of one of the minority parties in Denmark who has been leading that campaign. I spoke with her about the reasons why they opposed the deal which was put to Denmark. On the question of Angola and the UNITA peace negotiations going on there, I once again had the opportunity to speak to a person and to learn first-hand some of the facts that are not reported in the press. This gave me an opportunity to ask questions of the visiting American delegation at a later stage. I have a deep interest in Lebanon and I had the opportunity to meet former President Rene Mouawad's wife and to discuss her perception of matters in the Middle East. The conference provides a valuable opportunity for people to get closer to the issues, to gain an up-front perception of them and to increase their knowledge. That was one very positive aspect of the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting for me to see that people attend the conference and represent themselves. Australia was one of the countries which was flexible enough and democratic enough to have divided votes on a number of issues. We did not vote on all occasions as a concrete block of 13 votes. Very few countries engaged in that practice during the conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of the subcommittee on Cyprus as I have some interest in that area. I wish to express some concern about the dominance of the secretariat with regard to that committee. I do not know whether this is typical of all committees, but it was particularly evident on that subject. Because of the change-over of personnel between conferences and the fact that some people who do not have any particular expertise may be elected to a committee because their country has to provide someone, there seems to me to be too much influence by the continuing secretariat or the bureaucracy of the IPU. I think that matter has to be looked at seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that debate I expressed some concern that the IPU, unlike the United Nations, seemed incapable of mentioning Greece as a concrete party to the settlement of the problem. The secretariat also thought it was constructive to condemn Turkey for non-attendance. Even if people want the Turkish forces to leave, the solution to that problem will not be accomplished by passing motions condemning Turkey for non-attendance at meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, once again, members of that committee played a very constructive role. It was a very worthwhile learning process and I was pleased to have been a member of the delegation. As has been mentioned by other honourable members, there was a great sense of camaraderie amongst the members and staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter comes to the House of Representatives in the form of an amendment which has been promoted by the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I will endeavour to put it in context. Last year the West Australian Royal Commission sought from the Federal Government a change to the law to give the WA Royal Commission access to certain tax information. That request for tax information was made on the basis that in 1987 the Government had given the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in Queensland access to tax information in pursuit of the terms of reference of the Fitzgerald commission. Mr Deputy Chairman, you may remember that the Fitzgerald commission was aimed at corruption and, in particular, corruption in the National Party in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that occasion when the Fitzgerald commission said, `We would like to have access to the tax records', the Treasurer of the day, the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said, `Sure. The door's wide open'. The Government changed the law to allow that access. When the WA royal commissioners asked for the same access that had been given to the Fitzgerald commission to allow it to get stuck into the National Party, the door was slammed firmly shut in their faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this became public a month or so ago. There was, understandably, an absolute outcry. People wanted to know why it was that a Federal Labor government was happy to give access to tax information when it came to getting stuck into the National Party in Queensland, but when it came to looking after its mates in WA Inc. it wanted the door closed on that access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the public uproar, the Government decided to provide the WA Royal Commission with some access. In fact, it has transpired that, whereas the door was wide open for the Fitzgerald commission, the amendment which has been proposed in respect of information for the WA Royal Commission does not constitute the door being opened fully. The door is only ajar. The Government is providing access on the basis of the Royal Commission having an understanding about the commission of a serious offence. That is much more limited access than that which was provided for Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was given access so long as it was relevant to his terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important because in cases of corruption one needs to be able to follow the money trail, and that is basically what Fitzgerald was able to do. The access being provided to the WA Royal Commission is much more limited. The information can be made available only upon the disclosure of the commission of a serious offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen this Democrat amendment only in the last hour or so. The Opposition does not oppose it; it does not seem to be an unreasonable proposition. It suggests that when a royal commission asks the Federal Government to open the doors to tax information that should be a very public request. When a Treasurer, such as our current Prime Minister, decides to prevent access, then everybody should know about it; rather than finding out about it when the WA Royal Commission is nearing the completion of its work, as has happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is not bad and it certainly contrasts the way in which the matter was dealt with this time with the way in which it was dealt with in the case of Fitzgerald. When the WA Royal Commission asked for information it was dealt with by the Treasurer in his office. When the Fitzgerald commission asked for information it was dealt with by the full Cabinet and was properly handled in a more open way than occurred on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one matter remaining outstanding is the fact that the WA Commission asked for the same access as Fitzgerald and it has not got it. But it has not said why it is happy to have limited access. The commissioners are on the public record as saying, `We want full access as provided for Fitzgerald'. I think it is incumbent upon the WA Royal Commission to give us some explanation as to why it is prepared to settle for second best. I am sure the commissioners may well have very good reasons; but given the fact that they went public and said, `We want full access' yet they have been prepared to accept the limited access which is provided for in this legislation, I would like to hear an explanation as to why second best was good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been said, this is just another sorry saga about the way in which the Labor Party looks after its mates. This is limited access. The WA Royal Commission should have been provided with full access. If it was good enough to hunt down the National Party in Queensland, it should have been good enough to provide full access to the WA Royal Commission. We have certainly not been satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only presume that part of the answer from the WA Royal Commission is that it received so much evidence of serious offences committed by those major players, shall we say, in the matters being investigated by the Royal Commission, that it may have decided that it had enough work to keep it going for some time. Given the unbelievable nature and the intricacies of the deals done by the WA Labor Government and Rothwells, which was at its centre, I suppose that partial answer is no surprise. There are a lot of unanswered questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know what the link is between Rothwells and the New South Wales Right. We have known of money going from Perth across to Sydney. We ought to have a full explanation. The WA Royal Commission ought to have the powers to be able to follow the money trail and hunt it straight back into the New South Wales Right. These guys are the biggest wheelers and dealers in Australia's political history. They are into piggeries, the Marshall Islands, business migration schemes&mdash;all sorts of scams. We believe that where we have a royal commission which is to look at all the long tentacles of WA Inc., it is certainly a very odd matter that the Government should be so keen to limit its capacity to do the job it has been requested to do by the WA Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission has a job within specific terms of reference. The Government's argument is that it cannot give it full powers because it would go on a fishing expedition. I think that is a very odd argument. Firstly, it suggests that the commissioners&mdash;people such as Sir Roland Wilson, a former High Court judge&mdash;would be in the business of going on fishing expeditions, which is an insult to the Commission; and, secondly, it overlooks the fact that the Commission has specific terms of reference. The Commission is not entitled to go on fishing expeditions; it is entitled and required by law to conduct its investigations within the terms of reference set down in that case by the WA Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That whole argument is a complete furphy. The Royal Commission has clear and specific terms of reference. The Prime Minister has been shown to be a complete clot on this issue, because he was up there one day saying that they had complete access and then, when there was an uproar, he had to come in with this limited access proposal within 24 hours&mdash;another one of his U-turns, like we have had on privatisation, pay TV, TAFE and everything else this week. But on this occasion his inadequacies were shown, revealed and exposed for all to see. Quite frankly, the explanations justifying the Government's approach to this matter have been less than transparent and appropriate given all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the WA Royal Commission asked for full access. It has settled for second best. I think we ought to have at least a public explanation as to why. Otherwise, the coalition does not oppose this amendment. </PARA>

The point is that this is an important question of principle, a principle which the Opposition cannot make up its mind on. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he was then Treasurer, brought in some new arrangements to provide access for law enforcement agencies and commissions, such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a serious endeavour on the part of the Government to try to accommodate the interests of the Western Australian Royal Commission. Let me remind the Deputy Leader that the Royal Commission in Western Australia was established by the current Premier and has terms of reference which were acceptable to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. There has been no attempt on her part to try to cover up anything. She has given the terms of reference which the Liberal Party wanted and she established that Royal Commission in order to pursue all of the issues which had been raised in the public debate in Western Australia over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission came to us and said it wanted taxation information. We believed that, because the Commission had a unit of the Western Australian police force working with it, it could have access to the tax file numbers in accordance with the provision in 3E, which the current Prime Minister had introduced in 1989 in order to facilitate police access to tax files when they were pursuing matters involving a serious offence. What was not clear to us then&mdash;indeed the Royal Commission did not make this clear to us in any of its correspondence or in any of its discussions&mdash;was that the existence of that police unit did not provide the Commission with access via section 3E. When that finally became clear to us, when the Commission actually told us that that was what the problem was&mdash;I am not going to go into what the internal difficulties might be in terms of the administration of the Royal Commission; I am not interested in that&mdash;we said, `Okay, we will overcome that problem and identify your Commission specifically in the context of this legislation so that there is no doubt that you have exactly the same access to tax information as does the ICAC in New South Wales, as do police forces&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the trouble with the Liberal Party. Whenever one is trying to get to some sensible basis on which to change the legislation, legislation which is important in terms of protecting the secrecy of individuals, it says: why should people who are not alleged to be involved in serious offences have their tax files available not just to the royal commission but to any old witness who might come before a royal commission? So the Parliament should take no notice of the Liberal Party on this question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will not accept that the Royal Commission in Western Australia has had the opportunity to look at these amendments, and in fact we incorporated its additional proposals.

To say that it wants something else is a total distortion and a total piece of fabrication on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. This is what the WA Royal Commission wants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that we are involved in some cover-up is an absolute nonsense.

Oh no, when it suits him, when there is an opportunity for a bit of political mud-slinging, he will take the opportunity regardless of what he said and regardless of what his Leader said on an earlier occasion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me completely contradict a couple of things the Treasurer said. He said that the WA Royal Commission got what it asked for. That is not true. On an Australian Taxation Office minute paper, headed `Confidential No. 99', dated 11 October 1991 and returned to the ATO on 29 October 1991, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WA Commission has requested access to income tax information along similar lines to the access given to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what was asked for. The Treasurer should not come in here and say the Royal Commission asked for what it is now getting. That is simply not true. He is wrong, comprehensively wrong, and it is on the public record from the very documents that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only point I make is that this was what it asked for; it got less than it asked for. So let us have some explanation as to the difference. Why did it settle for second best? The Treasurer had a chance&mdash;I do not know whether the forms of the House will allow the Treasurer another go&mdash;to explain, and I would still like to know why. It is a genuine question. Why? I appreciate that he said the Royal Commission now accepts it, and maybe it does. But why? Is it pragmatic; is it that it does not want a political bunfight? It did say in its press release, `We are concerned about the misunderstandings'. The Royal Commission obviously did not want a public bunfight, it did not want to get into a political controversy in the Federal Parliament, and I can understand that. But we do not have an explanation. I ask the Treasurer to give us one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is in regard to the Treasurer's comments about our attitude to the amendment which provided limited access to ICAC&mdash;the New South Wales crimes commission&mdash;and two or three other bodies. The Treasurer claimed that we opposed it in principle. The reason I interjected earlier and said, `Go on and give us more from the quote of Dr Hewson' was that he specifically said, and I quote it now:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, I can see a genuine need in cases where tax information may be important in certain police investigations, particularly of major crimes. So our concern is not with the principle, if you like, of releasing the information. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is on the public record, yet the Treasurer got up and said that the Leader of the Opposition said something else. He did not. There it is. I am quite happy to have a reasonable and tight little debate about this, but if the Treasurer really wants to be in this debate he has to stick to the facts. Sure, we said that where tax information is being released on a sort of constant basis to law enforcement agencies and these various other commissions, different from the way in which information has been provided to royal commissions with specific terms of reference, and where it is being provided to any sort of Tom, Dick and Harry in the police forces around the States, there ought to be a tight mechanism for the release of that information. That is fair enough. That was our position and that is what we said. That is a very different matter to providing tax information to royal commissions, particularly when those royal commissions have to go down the money trail because their terms of reference incorporate the problems of corruption in whatever the circumstances might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point we are still making, the point the Treasurer still does not want to accept, is that when it came to the Fitzgerald Royal Commission the Government was prepared to provide wider access, yet when it comes to the WA Royal Commission it is not prepared to do so. It falls back to 3E, which has been brought in since Fitzgerald, and says, `This is what we usually do'. It is not what it usually does at all. In respect of royal commissions&mdash;not just Fitzgerald but Costigan and Stewart; and there may be others, but certainly in respect of those two&mdash;back in 1982, under us, and I think perhaps under the Government, we provided that access so that they could do their job. It is as simple as that. Section 3E was a device specifically for those standing agencies&mdash;the NCA, ICAC, the New South Wales crimes commission&mdash;and perhaps one or two others. So they are very different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has given us no explanation as to why it should impose the 3E limited access onto the WA Royal Commission and treat it, therefore, differently from the Fitzgerald commission. So I just say to the Treasurer that I would like to know what the answers are. That really boils it down to those two points: why is it that the Treasurer provided different access and why is it that the WA Royal Commission was prepared to settle for second best? I was not involved in the discussion. The Treasurer may not know the answers to those, but his officers were obviously involved in the discussions and he is making the claim that they are 100 per cent satisfied. On the public record there is no explanation for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, in respect of this matter we do not have any great problem with the Democrats' proposal. Lastly, on the Australia Card and all those sorts of things, I would be happy to have a debate with the Treasurer about the Australia Card and people's privacy any day. That was an abominable proposition. Some on the Left on his own side agreed with us, and I am glad that we finally knocked it over. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that there is not a great deal of difference between the WA Royal Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales. The Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales is given terms of reference from time to time not dissimilar to those that were given to the WA Royal Commission. It was in that context that the ICAC was given the same access as police forces have under the new 3E when it was introduced in 1989. So that seemed to be the proper basis on which to deal with the WA Royal Commission. If 3E had not been there, I suppose one might have provided the same access as Commonwealth royal commissions have. But the point is that 3E was there and we thought 3E was adequate to deal with those requirements. The only reason it was not was that the relationship was such that the WA police force, which could get the information, could apparently not pass it on to the commissioners. That was their concern. They knew that the police force could get it; the police force could get everything that was relevant to the investigation of a serious offence. The problem was that they did not think the Commonwealth law entitled the police to hand it on to the Royal Commission. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 1992 is to amend section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to allow the Chairman and other members of the Authority to be reappointed, up to a maximum period of appointment of four years. At present, while all categories of members of the Authority may be initially appointed for up to a maximum period of four years, only a member appointed for the purpose of dealing with a particular reference or references may be reappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority recommended, at paragraph 3.89, that the Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time be avoided. The Government can act to implement this recommendation by taking account of it when making appointments and determining the length of an appointment. However, the current situation facing the Authority shows that there is a need for greater flexibility in the legislation controlling appointments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Phillips resigned his position as Chairman of the National Crime Authority on 17 December 1991 to take up his appointment as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. In accordance with section 7 of the Act the Authority has two other members, Mr Greg Cusack, QC, based in Sydney and Mr Julian Leckie based in Melbourne, and one member specially appointed in relation to particular references, Mr Malcolm Gray, QC, based in Adelaide. The terms of appointment for Mr Cusack QC and Mr Leckie end on 30 June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would create serious problems for the Authority to lose both Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie on 30 June 1992. Both members are heavily involved in current references. Mr Sherman has only recently been appointed as Chairman and Mr Gray, QC, although he has been a member for almost 12 months, has necessarily been confined to a limited aspect of the Authority's operations. The further complication is that, as a result of Mr Justice Phillips's unexpected resignation, the Authority, in the absence of Messrs Cusack, QC, and Leckie, would lack members with any significant tenure and experience. It is Government policy, reflected in the National Crime Authority Act 1984, that no member of the Authority should serve for a period longer than four years. That policy is currently enshrined in section 37 of the National Crime Authority Act 1984, and this Bill makes no change to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the Act presently stands, it is not possible to reappoint members of the Authority, except for members specially appointed in relation to particular references, even  if the initial term was for a period of less than four years. The fact that one class of member can be reappointed while others cannot is an anomaly which the Bill will correct. In spite of the best planning, the current circumstances facing the Authority show that it is not possible to give a guarantee that continuity and overlap of membership can be provided for administratively. The Bill provides the Government with additional legislative flexibility to assist it in ensuring continuity and loss of expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has been brought on as a matter of urgency, as the Government wishes to reappoint both Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie for additional periods as members of the National Crime Authority, and that will have to be done before 30 June. The initial appointments of both members were for a period of three years, and the additional appointments will be such as to ensure that the total period of appointment is no more than four years in each case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Crime Authority was set up in 1984. Under its charter it has the function of collecting and analysing criminal information and intelligence relating to relevant criminal activities, and disseminating that information and intelligence to law enforcement agencies and other authorised persons. The National Crime Authority can also take references from the Commonwealth under section 13 of its Act, and it can take references from Ministers of the Crown of a State under section 14. References can be given to the National Crime Authority to look into relevant criminal activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relevant criminal activity is activity that relates to a relevant offence; that is, something that involves two or more offenders in substantial planning and organisation; that involves or is of a kind that ordinarily involves the use of sophisticated methods and techniques; that is committed or is of a kind ordinarily committed in conjunction with other offences or involves theft, fraud, tax evasion, currency violation, illegal drug dealing, illegal gambling, financial benefit by vice, extortion, violence, bribery, and other matters which are set out in the statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis of the National Crime Authority lay originally in the Costigan Royal Commission. Honourable members will remember that, as a result of certain irregularities which came to light on the Melbourne waterfront and concerned the ships painters and dockers, Mr Frank Costigan, QC, was given a royal commission to investigate. In the course of that investigation he uncovered not just irregularities on the Melbourne waterfront but irregularities in the conduct of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, irregularities in relation to a tax scheme, money laundering and a whole host of other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the Fraser Government set up the National Crimes Commission in 1982, and after the Hawke Government was elected in 1983, it brought in this legislation which was designed to repeal that Act and that Commission and to put in its place the National Crime Authority. Under the current terms of the Act, no person can hold office in the National Crime Authority for more than four years. There is no general right of reappointment, but there is provided a staggered system which is in part a transitional system that allows people appointed on certain dates possibilities of reappointment. It is a rather complicated system of transition and savings, which is to be amended by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will simplify the current provisions and give for the first time a general rule applicable to the Chairman and members, allowing reappointment. So there will now be a general right of reappointment in relation to members or the Chairman of the National Crime Authority. But taken together with the original appointment, any reappointment cannot exceed four years in length. A member or the Chairman can be reappointed any number of times, but the sum total of the first appointment and any of the reappointments cannot exceed four years. So there is still that limitation on the period that can be served, and one might observe that if the original appointment is for a period of four years, the provisions allowing a reappointment could not be exercised, because they would inevitably involve exceeding that maximum service period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has explained that the object of these amendments is to allow the reappointment of Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, whose terms are to expire on 30 June 1992. There is a third member, Mr Gray, QC, who was appointed on 1 July 1991 for two years and, as was mentioned in the second reading speech, we now have a new Chairman, who was appointed in place of Mr Justice Phillips. The point is, of course, that Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, were always going to terminate on 30 June 1992. This is not an unexpected event; it was always going to happen by reason of the date of their appointments and the duration of their appointments. Mr Gray, QC, was always going to continue beyond that date to 1993 by reason of his two-year appointment from July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only different fact which could be said to have given rise to the necessity for this amendment is that Mr Justice Phillips, who was appointed for four years in August 1990, resigned in December 1991. He resigned to take up an appointment as Chief Justice of the Victorian Supreme Court, and this of course could not have been anticipated at the time of his appointment. Mr Tom Sherman took up the position of Chairman on 26 February 1992. By June of this year he will have been in the position for only four months, whereas Mr Justice Phillips would have been there for two years. So the necessity for this amendment could only be said to arise from the fact that Mr Tom Sherman has only four months service, whereas Mr Justice Phillips would have had two years service.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been explained that there is a need for continuity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not really right to say that we need this Bill so that we can reappoint Mr Cusack, QC, and Mr Leckie because they are working on current references. The Government would not have been able to do that, anyway. It had nothing to do with timing. There was no right of reappointment. This prospect of reappointment is a new prospect held out by the Bill. That option would not have been open previously and is to be reopened by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis that it could be said that an unanticipated event has occurred&mdash;namely, that at the time of the roll-over of Cusack and Leckie, as it were, the Chairman had not been in office for as long as was anticipated&mdash;and that without this amendment there would not be sufficient continuity in the National Crime Authority, we support the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we do not want the Parliament to overlook the fact that there have been problems in the National Crime Authority over the years. One of the problems that has come to the attention of this House relates to Operation Ark, conducted by the National Crime Authority. Operation Ark arose out of the failure to notify the proper authorities, the Commissioner of Police in particular, of the fact that 13 allegations concerning police involvement in or protection of drug trafficking had been received during Operation Noah in 1989 in South Australia. At the time, the National Crime Authority was investigating allegations of corruption in the South Australian Police at the request of the South Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority commenced inquiries into Operation Ark on 17 March 1989 and continued to conduct hearings until 20 June 1989. The hearings were generally conducted by Adelaide member, Mr Mark Le Grand, sitting alone, although the NCA Chairman, Mr Justice Stewart, joined Mr Le Grand on two occasions. There was conflict over the report prepared by Mr Le Grand. The report was prepared under the chairmanship of Justice Stewart, but the formal report was submitted by his successor, Mr Faris. The report submitted under the chairmanship of Mr Faris was very different from the report prepared under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. An argument occurred as to whether the report had been submitted by the Authority whilst it was still under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Stewart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority took up this matter, as it was obliged to do. Members of that Committee were very concerned to satisfy themselves that members of the NCA were being forthright about the affair and not being restrained in making proper material available to them. As members of a parliamentary committee that was their duty. I think the people who serve on that Committee have taken a very responsible attitude towards it. On behalf of the public, they are supervising this institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of preparing material for this debate in the House, I have had occasion to read the report on Operation Ark that was prepared by the Committee. I mention in particular the fine work that was done by those coalition members who served on it and presented a dissenting report&mdash;Senator Crichton-Browne, Senator Vanstone, Mr Filing and Mr McGauran. They went into this at quite some length and presented a very good report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that concerned them, and rightly so, was that they were assured during that inquiry that Mr Le Grand had not been directed in any way not to give evidence or had not been restrained about the evidence he should give. It now appears that there is some legitimate doubt as to whether that assurance was right. That matter is being investigated by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, as it should be. Once the Senate Privileges Committee reports on that, it will make findings. I am not going to pre-empt its findings. It has been a very long hearing. If those facts should be found, it would be a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was controversy over Operation Ark. There was controversy over disclosure concerning Operation Ark and that was made known to the Parliamentary Joint Committee. There has been a Privileges Committee inquiry. There was&mdash;even previous to the appointment of Mr Justice Phillips&mdash;some instability in the National Crime Authority, with the premature resignation of Mr Faris. We must confront all those things honestly and say, `There does appear to have been a bit of instability in the National Crime Authority. The Parliamentary Committee is right to look at this very seriously, as is the Senate Privileges Committee'. We cannot come in here and pretend that everything is going along swimmingly and people should just carry on as they have, because if past events are to be faced up to honestly, the Authority has not been without its problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons that I indicated earlier, we think that on balance there is merit in this Bill. We would not like to see a situation arise in which it was conceivable that all the members of the Authority turned over in a very short space of time and the benefit of experience was lost. We would like to see the National Crime Authority retain experience and be able to execute its duties to its utmost capacity. We would like to see the National Crime Authority become a key instrument in dealing with organised crime in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the same token, that does not mean that the Parliament should be uncritical in looking at its performance. One of the things we must do if we want to see this Authority perform well is to make sure that we are getting value for money and that there is proper accountability. We must make sure that the money that is being spent is being properly directed at tracing organised crime and not being diverted in any way by disagreements within the Authority or by other extraneous matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In raising those concerns, which it is not our role to decide upon&mdash;I do not seek to decide upon them; they are matters to be decided upon by the Senate Privileges Committee&mdash;we hope they will be resolved in the proper place&mdash;at this stage, that is the Senate Privileges Committee. We support the amendment, dealing as it does with the matters in the way I have explained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) giving his historical perspective of the National Crime Authority. I can understand why he came into the Parliament and gave that historical perspective. Having just been appointed shadow Attorney-General by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I think he feels the need to justify his credentials for that position. I do not have any problem with the history he gave&mdash;it was reasonably accurate&mdash;but I certainly do have problems with his reference to Operation Ark and with his coming into this chamber, waxing lyrical and giving praise to the minority report that was presented by members of the Opposition in relation to Operation Ark. I have had something to say about that in this chamber in the past and I will repeat it here today, because it has been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the conduct of the coalition members in releasing that minority report was reprehensible in the extreme. In that minority report, they disclosed in camera evidence without any forewarning to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority and without any efforts to seek Committee approval in relation to the release of that in camera evidence. In my view, they set back relations between the Parliamentary Committee and the National Crime Authority light years. If that principle were continued, the Parliamentary Joint Committee could not properly supervise the National Crime Authority, because it would be unable to guarantee confidentiality to people who came before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had this argument before. Certainly, the Joint Committee is attempting to resolve it in discussions with both the National Crime Authority and the Attorney-General as to what is a proper formula. Part of the problem is that we have to deal with the other place. The Senate has different rules from those of the House of Representatives. In my view, if only the practice and procedure of the House of Representatives were operating, those people responsible for preparing the minority report and disclosing the in camera evidence and other evidence before the Committee would have had real problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, the other place is run on Rafferty's rules. Senators can roll into the Senate and disclose in camera evidence. There is an argument about this, which I concede. I am not saying that Senator Vanstone, Senator Crichton-Browne or the other members of the Committee are acting maliciously. I am saying that they are acting naively. I do not think they really appreciate the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to pre-judge the deliberations of the Privileges Committee in relation to the matter of privilege to do with members of the Authority. But I want to say in relation to the honourable member for Higgins, in terms of pre-empting the decision of the Privileges Committee, that I think that some members of the Committee have pursued a political campaign in relation to the South Australian situation to obtain headlines. They have jeopardised the relationship between the Parliamentary Joint Committee and the NCA. I think it is a politically based campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the honourable member for Higgins probably does not know is that the Joint Standing Committee on the National Crime Authority deliberated on that matter before the Privileges Committee and came to a conclusion. The five members of the Government&mdash;together with the Democrat, Senator Spindler, and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who is a Liberal member of this House&mdash;gave a clean bill of health to the members of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an earlier investigation, the Liberal members of the Committee, in particular Senator Hill, did not know how to ask questions. They did not know how to extract information and, quite frankly, they were incompetent. As a result of that, we have had this attempt, in my opinion, to quite improperly take on members of the NCA for not fully disclosing information to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I deliberated in relation to what the allegations were, as part of an inquiry that we as a joint committee undertook. I repeat that I certainly and the six other members were satisfied. Senator Vanstone and Senator Crichton-Browne abstained on the basis that they wanted to have a look at the transcript of evidence before they came to a decision. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) did not attend the final deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members of the Committee have used the release of that in camera evidence in the minority Operation Ark report to justify to the Privileges Committee their disclosure of in camera evidence, which, in my view, is quite improper. What has happened is that we have members of the Authority who are now subject to double jeopardy. With the greatest of respect to the other place&mdash;my opinion of the other place is well known&mdash;the greatest micro-economic reform that we as a government could achieve would be to abolish the Senate and do away with senators. I think it is true in this instance as well. I think that Rafferty's rules apply in the other place. So I take issue with the honourable member for Higgins in terms of praise and waxing lyrical in relation to that minority report on Operation Ark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House, the National Crime Authority Bill, is a simple one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of new members of the National Crime Authority is an important aspect of the Authority's administration. The Government should ensure that the terms of appointment of members allow for an overlap of membership and that a complete change of membership of the Authority at one time is avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Higgins and indeed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) have quite properly pointed out what the consequences would be if we did not pass this Bill. We would have a chairman who has not been there for all that long, and the member, in terms of the specific reference to Adelaide, Mr Gray, has not been there all that long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the Bill before the House because I think it rewords sections 37(1), (1A), (1B) and (1C) in a much more readable fashion and with better consequences. As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, currently one class of member can be reappointed while others cannot, and that is an anomaly in the National Crime Authority Act as it presently stands. But the principle remains the same: appointments and reappointments would be for a maximum of four years. I think that principle is an important one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that back in 1983 the NCA Bill did permit the reappointment of members. But in May 1984 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reported on the Bill, recommending that provision for reappointment be deleted. The Committee's concern was over the possibility of reappointment being used as an inducement to NCA members to perform in a way which is politically acceptable to the government of the day. This is stated in paragraph 7.8 of the Senate Committee's report. The Government accepted the recommendation that there should be no power to reappoint. The Bill was amended accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Separate 1988 amendments of the NCA Act provided for reappointment in two cases: for the then Chairman and members as part of the transition from an authority whose existence was subject to the sunset clause to a permanent authority; and for any additional member appointed to assist with the specific reference, provided the total term does not exceed four years. My understanding is that the anomaly arises as a result of those 1988 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly am of the view that the four years should be the maximum term. Certainly we need to look at staggering  appointments, but one thing I do not want to see is the staggering of appointments being used as an excuse to extend the four-year appointment. One of the things that the Senate Standing Committee had to say bears repeating. On page 84 of its recommendations it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General himself then referred to the possibility of governments acting with the wrong motivation (Evidence, p. 328). There is a possibility of renewability being used as an inducement to perform in a way which is politically acceptable to the government of the day. In the Committee's view, the temptation is sufficiently great to warrant the deletion of the renewability provision from the Bill. The Committee sees merit in a four-year term, not subject to renewal. This, in our view, is sufficient time for members to be effective without the possibility of political interference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the effective operation of the Authority that there should be continuity of leadership and direction. This could be jeopardised where all three members' terms are congruent. The Committee favours a system whereby the members' terms are staggered, so as to ensure a significant overlap between the terms of experienced members and those of incoming members. One possible method would be at the establishment of the Authority to appoint the Chairman for a fixed four years and the other members for fixed terms greater than three, but not exceeding, four years.</PARA>
<PARA>So even back then, the problem that we are now facing was envisaged. What I am suggesting is that when Mr Leckie's and Mr Cusack's appointments expire&mdash;and if this Bill is passed, that will obviously be next year&mdash;consideration should be given to appointing members in their place, but not for the four years. The staggering should begin when Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack are eventually replaced. In that way the four years will be preserved. That is a very important principle that this Parliament should be aware of. I think a term any longer than four years is not appropriate for members of the National Crime Authority. That is probably the right period of time. The last thing we want in this country is another J. Edgar Hoover parading around the countryside with the special powers that are conferred on the National Crime Authority and being able to operate for a period of more than four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Opposition is obviously supporting the Bill, I will conclude there. There is nothing much more that I have to say, other than to say categorically to this place that in my view Mr Leckie and Mr Cusack, QC, are eminently qualified for reappointment. They have served with distinction as members of the bar in their respective States. I have a long association with Mr Cusack, dating back to when he was a public defender. This House should not have any fears in relation to the matter before the Privileges Committee because, in my submission, that matter is a political witch-hunt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on this matter for several reasons. Firstly, I have been a member of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority only for the term of this Parliament, and there are aspects of the deliberations that I wanted to refer to. As to the matters of the Ark and the Privileges Committee, I say no more than that I have a great deal of sympathy for the point of view that has been raised by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill is such that there is no doubt that it makes sense to extend the terms of Messrs Greg Cusack QC and Julian Leckie QC. A new Chairman having been appointed, it would seem eminently sensible&mdash;as the report of the Committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS> suggested&mdash;to allow them to remain in office and to play some part in insuring continuity within the deliberations of the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of substance on which I wanted to speak was a little broader than that. The honourable member for Higgins gave what I thought was a very good exposition on the background to the creation of the National Crime Authority. I do not want to repeat that, but it is worth looking at whether or not we need a National Crime Authority. Its genesis was the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. After the Costigan Royal Commission a proposal went to legislative form, but it was not proceeded with on the election of the Hawke Government in 1983. The legislation to create the National Crime Authority emerged some time later. Without doubt, the National Crime Authority has some runs on the board. My time on the Committee has been more under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Phillips, and currently Mr Tom Sherman, than it was under Mr Justice Stewart. I had no experience of their predecessors; therefore I offer no views about the Committee at that stage. However, as I said, I have some sympathy for the minority view in the report on the Ark inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry is that we have the National Crime Authority  only because the States do not seem to be able to get on with each other and are not prepared to accept any other body.  At present we have directors of public prosecutions appointed federally and in each of the States. The capabilities of the police forces are certainly being improved in each of the States. They are looking to their own operations and attempting to broaden their capacity to deal with levels of crime that may have been beyond their reach in days gone by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian Federal Police we have an excellent body which has embarked on a number of areas of responsibility that do not peculiarly relate to duties in the ACT, but now embrace Commonwealth crimes wherever they might occur. The reason behind the National Crime Authority was that it was felt necessary to create a body which was able to bring together the State police forces and to look into organised crime. That there is organised crime and that there is reason to look into it is not contestable. But how we best approach it, and whether or not the National Crime Authority is the best agency for the purpose, are matters that I question. I have not yet reached a concluded point of view on that. But there are significant disadvantages in the manner in which the National Crime Authority pursues inquiries, in that it cannot be certain that, having concluded its inquiries, prosecutions will ensue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an inevitable problem in the Director of Public Prosecutions&mdash;be he a Federal or State DPP&mdash;feeling it necessary to be at arms length from prosecutions and the collection of evidence to proceed with a prosecution. I am quite concerned that in so many inquiries there is duplication of effort. There is a problem from the National Crime Authority point of view in ensuring that matters that have been investigated proceed to the point of prosecution. We find that, for one reason or another, the DPP feels there is not enough evidence to succeed with a prosecution and in some instances not even enough evidence to initiate a prosecution. More fundamentally, there are occasions when, having launched a prosecution, there is not enough evidence to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This gap between the capacity of the NCA to produce the evidence needed in court to succeed in a prosecution is one of the areas of my doubt. Sadly, as was the case in the past, there is still far too much difference between the State and Federal police forces. It is regrettable that there cannot be greater coordination so that, at the police level, there could be an investigation into organised crime, following which the matter could go straight to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have an open mind on the continued existence of the National Crime Authority because I question not whether the role needs to be exercised but whether we cannot, perhaps, have some nationwide DPP authority which better coordinates the efforts of the directors of public prosecutions and allows them to have their staff seconded to whoever is going to undertake the inquiry process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the difficulties with the DPPs. I know their legal obligations and the degree to which they feel there would be a problem in so doing. But every time we raise another body or create another entity, we have not only the cost of that body but a duplication of services. One thing that is apparent, even in the legislation before us, is that we are trying to keep a body that is turning over. We are extending the term for two of the members, but we are not extending it beyond four years. The whole concept is that the Chairman and the members will be there for a relatively brief period and therefore cannot be said to be so entrenched or blinkered in their thinking that they will reach conclusions based on their views on other matters in which they have been involved, or will be unable to assess the Commonwealth point of view, or the views of the States or other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the four-year term, but I suggest that it might well be time that we thought of introducing sunset legislation for the NCA. What would happen if we did that? We have only to look at what happened with another body that tabled a report in this Parliament a little while ago. I refer to ACIAR&mdash;the Australian Council for International Agricultural Research. It made everybody look at the body and say, `What is its role?  Is it worth continuing?'. Is the NCA a body that has, in conjunction with the DPPs and the State and Federal police, a role which ensures that it should remain in place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genesis was uncertain. I think that members on both sides of the Parliament have been doubtful as to whether the reports on certain inquiries have been sufficiently professional. However, I should say that in my experience, under the chairmanship of the two chairmen with whom I have been associated, Mr Justice Phillips and Mr Justice Sherman, I have no reason to question that. Of course, Mr Sherman has only just joined the NCA. Under Mr Justice Phillips I felt happy that the body was being well controlled and heading in a direction which I felt was one that was proper and not duplicating the effort of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I must say that already there are notable changes in the direction that is being set by the new chairperson. Certainly, if we compare the role of the NCA under Mr Justice Phillips and under his predecessors, we see that there is a marked difference. Obviously, if there is to be an open canvass on the way in which these inquiries are undertaken, I am not really convinced that there should continue to be a National Crime Authority. It is for that reason that, while I recognise the work that is being done and commend the NCA for some present and past successes, I should say I am not convinced that the NCA should have a permanent right to exist. I think it is there because of the failure of existing organisations, not because it has a role that is necessarily demonstrable, identifiable and permanent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not commending or condemning the present directions of the NCA. I think that, obviously, they are very much a matter for the Inter-Governmental Committee and of the present Chairman. It is not the role of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to set those directions. However, I confess that, were I Minister, I would want to look behind the NCA's operations far more than I have been able to do as a member of that Committee. I would like to be convinced in my own mind that the tasks it is performing could not be better undertaken by a better cooperative effort between State and Federal police on the one hand and between State and Federal DPPs on the other. Certainly, it will be in that direction that I will be maintaining some vigilance in the course of my membership of that National Crime Authority Committee and in any contributions in the House on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I support entirely the recommendations in this Bill. I think that they make sense. I will be interested to see the extent to which in the course of the next 12 months, during the final period of the terms of Messrs Cusack and Leckie and under the chairmanship of Mr Tom Sherman, there is sufficient justification for me to be convinced that the NCA should continue to exist. Whether it does or not, I certainly  hope that there can be better liaison between the Federal and State DPPs and the NCA to ensure that investigations are concluded with successful prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a postscript, I should say that there is one other aspect of this legislation that I should bring to the attention of the House on the eve of World Environment Day. We, of course, know that the Minister for Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is attending, at considerable expense, the conference in Rio. She is attending with two of her ministerial colleagues and 49 Federal delegates and others from various bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>They are all over there talking about the environment and why we should not cut down trees and why we should not do other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was, therefore, most impressed when I picked up my copy of the Bill. I know that there are difficulties for the Commonwealth Government Printer, but members of the public would be interested to know that there are five pages in this Bill. It is really a fairly perfunctory piece of legislation. The schedule is headed, `Minor Amendments of Principal Act'. Lest honourable members think that the Bill is only five pages long, I should tell them that there are 16 pages within which those five pages are printed. Most of it consists of totally blank paper. While I understand that perhaps there is invisible writing on those 11 pages, I suggest that if the Government wishes to conserve trees, this is not exactly the best way to do so. It might well be better that, having in mind the fundamental significance of preserving mother nature, planting trees and doing those other admirable things, the next time a minor amendment is made to legislation, perhaps only so much paper need be used as is necessary to print the Bill itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and to support the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill, because one of the important considerations that have to be realised in relation to this Bill is that it has been proposed in response to the evaluation report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS> of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Of course, it is designed to deal with the problem of the cut-off from one authority to another&mdash;the problem that arises from the non-overlap of tenure of members of the Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas in which this problem was seen quite clearly related to Operation Ark in South Australia. I want to deal with a couple of matters relating to Operation Ark that were raised by the honourable member for Banks. The problem with the Operation Ark report was that there was a changeover from one group of members of the Authority to another group of members. Honourable members may recall that Justice Stewart was the Chairman of the NCA in 1989. At the changeover, I think in July 1989, Peter Faris became the Chairman and there was a changeover of members of the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period prior to the changeover a report on Operation Ark was prepared. This was a reference undertaken by the Authority in South Australia to look into allegations of corruption against members of the South Australian Police Force. What happened as a consequence was that the report was prepared just prior to the cessation of office of Justice Stewart and his fellow members of the Authority. The report was prepared and, allegedly, was forwarded as the report of the Authority. When the new Chairman and members of the Authority took office, they made a point of saying that that report was not a report of the National Crime Authority. They made changes to it and forwarded a different report to the South Australian Attorney-General in relation to Operation Ark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, that led to the great conflict that has arisen in South Australia. As a consequence, we had a fairly substantial debate within the Committee on the ramifications of just whose report it was&mdash;whether the right report was in fact Justice Stewart's or Mr Faris's; just which report was the real Operation Ark report. During that debate within the Committee there was a question of a breach of privilege. I do not want to pre-empt the deliberations of the Senate Privileges Committee. The honourable member for Banks pointed out that he did not want to, either&mdash;although I must say that the way he is going, he wants to abolish the Senate. The Senate probably will not get round to making that deliberation by the time he gets&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Banks. He has let himself into a bit of a trap. He mentioned that there was a decision by the Committee to give Mr Dempsey and Mr Cusack a clean bill of health in relation to the allegations of a breach of privilege. I want to clarify exactly what happened during that decision making process. In particular, he mentioned my role in that decision making process. I want to clarify my role quite specifically. On the basis of the evidence that was presented to us, I did not consider there to be a prima facie case of a breach of privilege. However, I qualified that quite deliberately on the basis that we were actually prevented from hearing the evidence of Mark Le Grande, who was a South Australian member of the Authority prior to that changeover back in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked to hear the evidence from Mr Le Grande and we were prevented from doing so. As a consequence we got to hear only one side of the story. That is why I made my decision, but it was a qualified decision. As a result of the tabling of the minority report on Operation Ark, the matter was referred to the Privileges Committee for further action. That inquiry is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that the honourable member for Banks raised was the relationship between the NCA and the Committee. I said he was going into a bit of a trap because his colleague on the other side of the chamber made a similar blunder by alleging that, because of this report, because of some sort of behaviour on the part of Opposition members of the Committee, somehow the relationship between the Committee and NCA was tainted, that there was a reluctance on the part of the NCA to deal openly and closely with the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a similar allegation by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and, as a consequence, he had to come back into the House. He made the allegation that there was an estrangement between the Committee and the NCA. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I incorrectly interpreted remarks made by Justice Phillips, the new Chairman of the NCA, at a meeting last week and have, in fact, misled the House about the nature of those remarks. Justice Phillips did not imply that the NCA would now find itself unable to work with the Committee and he did not imply or suggest that there could not be the usual exchange of information between the Parliamentary Committee and the NCA. He did say that on some of the matters at present in dispute within the Committee he did not wish the NCA to become a political football and wished those matters to be resolved between the Parliament and the politicians.</PARA>
<PARA>That gives the lie to the allegation made by the honourable member for Banks. The assertion that there was an estrangement between the Committee and the NCA as a result of the Operation Ark minority report tabled in October 1990 is quite fallacious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise that the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill&mdash;I mentioned this earlier&mdash;is a consequence of the recommendations made in the evaluation report. The evaluation report was a valuable exercise. We certainly heard a substantial amount of evidence, we had a large number of hearings and we were able to get a pretty good handle on not only how the NCA was performing but also how it was perceived to be performing. We know, for obvious reasons, that there has been constant speculation in the media about whether the NCA is worth retaining. I happen to believe the NCA should be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the circumstances, the changes proposed in the Bill are healthy because they give the NCA a greater opportunity for continuity in the administration of the Authority. Quite clearly, the administration of the Authority has been the greatest source of criticism. Most commentators' perception of the problems within the NCA is that they have largely revolved around the question of administration, rather than the question of the hands-on inquiries. That is not to say that there have not been some problems with the inquiries. We have seen instances where the NCA has had some spectacular failures. Nonetheless, it has had some successes, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in recent times have meant going down the path of pursuing white collar criminals. During the 1980s there was considerable speculation about why the NCA had not gone down that path earlier and had not been able to pull in some of the operators in Western Australia and elsewhere who were causing considerable speculation over allegations of fraud. </PARA>

The honourable member for Banks knows only too well that that publication was perfectly in order with the rules of Senate committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the fact that the minority report was published in the Senate, there can be no inferences or other assertions drawn from my behaviour or that of my colleagues who signed that minority report. We did that within the rules and with a view to displaying clearly to the community the problems that had arisen from the Operation Ark report, in particular, the problems that arose from the fact that the Committee's majority report virtually whitewashed the whole incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Banks will recall, the matter arose in the lifetime of the previous Committee. That committee said, `We'll hand it on to the next committee'. When the matter came before our Committee, what happened? The Committee said, `This is old hat; we really ought to be getting onto new stuff'. Without resolving the problem, the modus operandi of Government members was: look, this is old hat; let us forget about it; let sleeping dogs lie. The intent of the Committee's report was to draw the community's attention to the fact that this matter had not been resolved satisfactorily and there were other questions about evidence that had not been given to the Committee by members of the Authority in relation to Operation Ark. All I can say is that the Opposition members of the Committee believe they have a very important role to play in relation to the supervision of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell honourable members why it is important that the Committee properly supervises, properly oversees, the National Crime Authority. There are only two areas of supervision of the NCA: one is the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee&mdash;the PJC as it is known colloquially&mdash;and the other is the IGC, the intergovernmental committee. All of us on the Committee have agreed that the IGC's behaviour or standard of supervision has been absolutely atrocious. In fact, the IGC has met on so few occasions that it is a wonder it even knew what the heck was going on in the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our discussions with the IGC it became clear&mdash;to me, anyway&mdash;that some of the people did not have much of a handle on what was happening within the Authority. That reinforces the importance of the work undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee. Unless somebody is overseeing the National Crime Authority in an effective way, with the powers that have been vested in the National Crime Authority under the Act, quite clearly there is the possibility of those powers being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the original intent of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Bill proposes some valuable amendments to the National Crime Authority Act. As a consequence we may see a greater stability in the administration of the NCA. I would like to see that. I want the NCA to be an effective body. It has a very important role to play. One problem that has arisen in the past has been the relationship between the NCA and other State police forces and their Ministers. A more stable administration will allow for a much better understanding between the NCA and the other State police forces that have to cooperate from time to time with the NCA in its inquiries and whose officers are seconded to the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is unfortunate that, in addressing the catalyst for this change, the problem of the changeover in South Australia and the Operation Ark fiasco&mdash;that is what I call it&mdash;the honourable member for Banks raised some allegations which are not only incorrect but also fallacious. They go against what his colleague the honourable member for Burke conceded&mdash;that is, there was no estrangement between the Committee and the NCA as a result of the deliberations of the Committee and the signing of the minority report by Senator Vanstone, Senator Crichton-Browne, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) and myself.

That point was raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), and I think it needs to be made clear. That will have the effect of staggering, to some extent, appointments to the NCA in the future. That will certainly be a good thing and should ensure that there is less likelihood of the bunching of appointments in the future so that we will have greater continuity of NCA membership than we have had in the past.

There have certainly been some problems in the past&mdash;I would not deny that and I do not think anybody would. Some speakers implied that the Government or others could have foreseen in some way or other what happened with the now Mr Justice Phillips. That is clearly not the case. Nobody could have fairly expected him not to accept an appointment as the Chief Justice of Victoria when that was offered. Quite clearly, it was unfortunate in terms of the administration of the NCA, but obviously it was not a situation which anybody could cavil at. I think the House ought to concede that point.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1991 the Parliament passed legislation ensuring the highest standards of accountability in the Australian political process. The funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act were substantially enhanced to provide for comprehensive financial disclosure by political and third parties. These major changes to our electoral system were brought about with the decisive support of all members of the Parliament. As a result of the amendments, the Act now imposes an obligation upon registered political parties to lodge annual returns of all income, expenditure and debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act also requires far greater accountability from `third parties' who participate in the electoral process by requiring the disclosure of gifts made by them to political parties. The Australian Electoral Commission has also been given enhanced powers to conduct random spot audits to ensure compliance with the disclosure provisions and further reporting powers in relation to such audits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the enhanced disclosure scheme came into effect immediately upon passage of the amendments on 19 December 1991. Over the ensuing period the full implications of the amended regime have become apparent, as political and third parties and the Australian Electoral Commission have examined closely the procedural requirements needed to be taken to comply with the Act. It has become clear that certain of the enhanced requirements&mdash;particularly those dealing with annual political party returns&mdash;will cause extreme administrative difficulties for political parties, particularly at the volunteer officer and branch level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has therefore reviewed the disclosure provisions to determine whether steps could be taken to reduce the administrative burden upon political parties whilst preserving the primary objective of full disclosure and transparency of the political process. The difficulties identified do not arise from the requirement to record and disclose the total amounts received, paid or owed by political parties. The changes the Government proposes in this Bill will not effect this important requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major administrative burden upon political parties arises out of an obligation to record certain other information in respect of every single transaction entered into by the party and its constituent organs, much of which will not ultimately need to be disclosed. This arises because, in addition to disclosing all income, expenditure and debts of the party, the annual returns must identify every person or organisation that pays to, receives from or is owed by the party a total annual amount of $1,500 or more. The $1,500 limit set by the Parliament which triggers the identification requirement is reasonable and justifiable. However, the requirement is cast in absolute terms and therefore encompasses all amounts received, paid or owed to the party, including small and insignificant sums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to comply with the letter of the law, political parties will be required to keep records of the identity of everyone from whom they receive, or to whom they pay or owe any amount, and to collate all of these amounts annually to determine whether an individual's identity must be disclosed. This will include both small and large single amounts. It will include $1 raffle tickets, and thousand dollar donations and, for the purpose of the identification requirement, will not make any administrative distinction between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All political parties in Australia are voluntary bodies which rely on their membership for the organisation of party activities in the majority of circumstances. This is especially so at the local branch level. Whilst the major political parties employ full time office holders and organisational staff, much of the initial administrative burden of recording details of financial transactions will fall at the branch level. It is unrealistic to expect voluntary office holders to be able to comply with these requirements. It is, as a result, also unrealistic to expect the agents of registered political parties to be able to ensure that complete returns are lodged with regard to the identification requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill therefore proposes the following response to these administrative difficulties. Division 5A of part XX of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which provides for annual returns by registered political parties, will be repealed and replaced by a revised division 5A. The new provision will continue to require annual returns by all registered political parties of the total amounts received, paid or owed by or on behalf of the party during the reporting year. Regulations will be able to be made requiring a breakdown of the total amounts into subtotals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disclosure requirements must embrace all units of political parties to prevent avoidance. However, the current provisions could be modified to enable parties latitude in respect of minor expenditure or income, whilst ensuring significant transactions and those involved in them are still reported. Furthermore, the enhanced random auditing power of the Electoral Commission will be available to it to enforce compliance with the disclosure scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new division 5A will require parties to report the particulars, including the name and address, of any individual from whom they receive a total amount of $1,500 or more during the reporting year. However, parties will not be required to count towards any total amount received by an individual, amounts of less than $100 received from a fundraising event. In practice, whilst party units conducting such events will need to record the total amount received, they will not need to attribute amounts of less than $100 to their source for recording purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amounts paid by political parties will be treated in a similar way. Whilst particulars will need to be reported of any individual to whom the party pays total amounts of $1,500 or more in the reporting year, single items of expenditure of $100 or more will not be required to be counted towards the total amount for any individual or organisation. In addition, to protect the legitimate privacy concerns of employees of political parties, amounts paid by way of bona fide salaries or employment related entitlements will not need to be counted for the purposes of the identification requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As debts are not normally incurred for or on behalf of parties in respect of similar insignificant amounts, no corresponding provisions are necessary in the case of amounts owed by political parties, and the requirement to disclose the identity of those to whom a party owes $1,500 or more has not been altered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particulars required to be disclosed in respect of individuals or organisations to be identified in returns will also be amended. The Bill will standardise these particulars so that they are common throughout the various disclosure requirements in the Act. Additional information will be required regarding the identity of persons who are in positions of control of trusts and unincorporated associations. In respect of the latter, the names and addresses of the members of the executive committee, howsoever described, will be required. This will assist the Australian Electoral Commission in its investigations and enforcement of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, a separate definition of `registered industrial organisation' encompassing all such organisations registered under the relevant Commonwealth or State industrial relations legislation will be inserted in the Act. As the names and addresses of the executives of such organisations are available publicly through the relevant register of industrial organisations in the same way as directors of companies can be identified by reference to registered company records, these particulars will not be required to be included in returns under the Act. Because of the immediate introduction of the enhanced disclosure requirements, a significant level of uncertainty as to the obligations they impose upon participants in the political process has arisen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the disclosure requirements will be further amended by this Bill, it would be unreasonable to expect compliance with the existing requirements, in the form of returns for the period from 19 December 1991 until 30 June 1992. Sufficient records enabling compliance with the existing provisions are unlikely to have been kept due to ignorance of the extent of the disclosure obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new division 5A will therefore apply prospectively from 1 July 1992, and the first annual return required by the division will cover the 1992-93 financial year. Similar transitional provisions will be made with respect to the amended disclosure requirements in section 305 and sections 308 and 309 of the Act relating to third party reporting of expenditure for political purposes and electoral expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 314AA currently requires that registered political parties' annual returns must be lodged within eight weeks of the end of the financial year. Previously political parties had been given 20 weeks following general elections to lodge returns in respect of disclosable gifts and expenditure received and incurred during the disclosure period or, in layman's terms, the period from the previous election until the election just held. As the new regime requires disclosure of far greater detail, albeit on a more regular basis, it is reasonable to afford political parties the same reporting period as applied to the more limited previous disclosure requirements. Proposed new division 5A will incorporate a 20-week reporting period. This will alleviate the difficulties that would arise where an election is called during the period just preceding or following the end of the financial year. Such an election would of course reduce substantially the resources available to parties to prepare disclosure returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the Act requires the Electoral Commission to process the annual party returns and make them available for public inspection within four weeks of the end of the reporting period. To ensure the Commission has adequate time to collate and prepare the returns, this period will be extended until the end of January each year, a period of approximately 10 weeks. Further amendments proposed by this Bill will tighten the operation of the disclosure scheme and close minor potential loopholes which have been identified since the passage of the 1991 amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 305 of the Act requires disclosure of expenditure incurred for political purposes. This includes the making of certain gifts to political parties. Where a third party makes a gift to a political party equal to or exceeding $1,000, the third party must disclose all gifts received by them during the disclosure period, equal to or exceeding $1,000. However, the initial gift to the political party which triggers the obligation to disclose gifts received is limited to gifts made on the condition that they be used for a purpose related to an election. This in effect preserves the distinction between gifts for electoral and non-electoral purposes which was removed from the other disclosure requirements in the Act by the 1991 amendments. The Bill will amend section 305 to remove this distinction, thus ensuring consistency throughout the disclosure scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 309 of the Act requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure which is defined in section 308. Both sections were amended by the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991 to require disclosure by the donor of gifts to political parties, candidates and other organisations or persons specified in the gazette by the Electoral Commission. Previously section 308 related to types of expenditure incurred during the relevant election period. The intention behind the amendments to section 308 was that they apply to gifts received at all times during the disclosure period. The changes made to the Act in 1991 do not achieve this result with sufficient certainty or clarity. This is primarily because the other types of expenditure covered by section 308 relate solely to election period expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the intention is unambiguously applied, the Act will be amended to create a separate reporting requirement for third party gifts received during the relevant disclosure period to be included in proposed section 305A. This will ensure that third parties must disclose financial relationships with political parties and candidates as well as their direct participation in the political process through electoral expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 309, which requires the disclosure of electoral expenditure, was amended by the 1991 Act to allow regulations to be made which prescribed amounts under which disclosure of gifts to candidates, political parties or prescribed organisations would not be required. Proposed section 305A will incorporate these amounts which have been determined so as to reflect consistency with the other requirements of the disclosure scheme. The amounts included in section 305A are $4,500 for gifts to political parties, $200 for candidates and $1,000 for prescribed third parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 318 of the Act enables persons required to lodge disclosure returns, but who are unable to do so completely because they do not possess and cannot obtain relevant information, to inform the Electoral Commission of their inability and to identify any person they have reasonable grounds to believe is able to provide the Commission with the information. These steps protect the person required to lodge returns from liability for failure to comply with the disclosure requirements. The section does not currently apply to division 5A and therefore party agents are not presently able to avail themselves of its protection with regard to incomplete annual party returns. There is no justifiable reason for exempting these returns from the operation of section 318. The Bill will correct this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will also clarify the position of unregistered political parties under the disclosure regime by providing that those political parties not included in the register of political parties under the Act be treated as `third parties' for disclosure purposes. This will close a potential loophole and ensure that those parties who do not register as political parties under the Act yet participate in the political process are subject to disclosure. The relationship of campaign committees to registered political parties for the purposes of annual party returns will also be clarified to ensure that campaign committees are treated as organs of the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the political disclosures scheme proposed in this Bill will address matters of administrative concern. They will ensure that volunteer members, who are the mainstay of political parties in Australia, are able to meet the obligations placed upon them by the scheme whilst retaining the full disclosure of all amounts paid, received or owed by registered political parties and the identification of all those involved in significant transactions with them. The Bill will also tighten the disclosure requirements and remove potential loopholes from the current scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. It relates to part 3 of the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Act 1991. This Act was passed through Parliament in December 1991 and amended the Broadcasting Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Honourable members will remember that the main part of this Act was to ban television and radio advertising of political broadcasts during an election period. It also led to the longest continuous debate in another place since 1964.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act at the time tightened up disclosure provisions in respect of donations to political parties. The effect of these amendments was as follows: donations to political parties above $1,500 had to be disclosed; every political party or branch of a political party was required to provide the Electoral Commission within eight weeks at the end of each financial year with details of, firstly, all amounts received by a political party and persons or organisations for whom those amounts were received, secondly, all amounts paid by a political party and the names of persons or organisations to whom those amounts were paid and, finally, outstanding amounts of all debts at the end of the financial year, and the names of persons or organisations owed the outstanding amounts. The original legislation also sought to ensure that gifts by third parties to political parties had to be disclosed, and donations from trusts and foundations had to be disclosed. The explanatory notes of this Bill state the necessity for it in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has become apparent that, to comply with the requirement to disclose, keeping records of every amount received and paid by or on behalf of a registered political party would place an excessive administrative burden on those parties, particularly in areas largely serviced by volunteer workers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is actually a rather nice way of saying, `We got it disastrously wrong the first time in the Bill'. So we have this Bill, the effect of which is as follows: firstly, the names and addresses of any person or organisation which contributes $,1500 or more will still have to be disclosed, but individual amounts of less than $100 received from fundraising events will not need to be accumulated. Without this it would mean that every person buying a $1 raffle ticket from a political party would have to have his or her name and address recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this Bill would mean that first annual returns by political parties would be required 20 weeks from the end of the financial year. It will mean that by removing third party political party expenditure requirements the distinction between gifts made to political parties for electoral and non-electoral purposes will be abolished. This is a good thing because it might now mean that all the money that came from WA Inc. over to the eastern States Labor parties might finally be disclosed. It will also mean that unregistered political parties which are not required to lodge annual returns will be treated as third parties for disclosure purposes and registered unions will be treated in the same way as companies, thus there will be no requirement to include the names and addresses of executives of those unions in returns. I do not think that will benefit my Party very greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing Act, political parties need to record the identity of every single person or organisation who pays to, or receives from, or is owed any money by the party, regardless of how small that sum might be. The data must be collected and collated to determine the total sum paid to, received by, or owed by the party exceeds the $1,500 limit, which triggers the identification requirements for disclosure. The revised division 5A incorporated in this Bill, which exempts the reporting of sums of less than $100 received by a party during a fundraising event, and the disclosure of sums of less than $100 owed by the parties, will go some way towards easing the administrative burden of complying with the disclosure of provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, new section 314AB allows registered political parties 20 weeks instead of the existing eight weeks to lodge their annual returns at the end of the financial year. This is a more realistic timeframe in which to prepare those reports. The Opposition welcomes the provision of this new section, which will protect the privacy of party employees by exempting details of their wages and salaries from the party's reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the amendments in the Bill, the Government's funding and disclosure legislation still remains flawed and inadequate. On the one hand, the reporting requirements are so onerous that they will deter honest people from donating to a political party, while, on the other hand, there are still large gaps in some of the disclosure laws that it is possible to circumvent them. The Government pays lip-service to the notion of full accountability of political funding and expenditure, but its laws are neither fair nor equitable. This was canvassed extensively in December 1991 on the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill. As was pointed out at that time, the coalition supports full, fair and equitable disclosure of political donations. To achieve this, we believe that disclosure laws must ensure that a level playing field exists between the parties, including in regard to taxation, so that no party enjoys a tax advantage over the others. There should be severe penalties if any donor to a political party is singled out for punitive action as a result of making that donation, and donations should be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government has turned a blind eye to these issues, which are essential for fair and just funding and disclosure laws. There is no level playing field between the parties. When I say `the parties' I mean the Labor Party as against any other political party in Australia, whether it be the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Australian Democrats or any other group. It enjoys that unfair financial advantage because of its special relationship with the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP benefits greatly from the current regime, under which the trade union movement can make tax free donations to the party. It is not generally recognised in the community that all the income received by trade unions is tax free money. A trade union would pay no tax if it owned, for example, a Gold Coast casino or a part of it. If a trade union sells a major building which it owns in the central business district of a capital city, it does not pay capital gains tax. In the State of Queensland, unions are absolved from paying land tax. Yet the trade union movement is a major organisation in Australia with major investments and it is given a privileged status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that funding and disclosure provisions must ensure that donations to parties are voluntary. No such safeguard exists at present. In fact, the Labor Party profits handsomely from the de facto compulsory donations of ordinary workers where people are faced with the decision to be members of a union or not to have a job, as is the case in every closed shop throughout Australia. It occurs across the board in the mining industry, in the major building industry and in such places as the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worker's union dues are tax deductible. That tax deductibility is then passed on to the ALP by way of affiliation fees, which vary from place to place, but are generally around $2.10 per head per annum. It would be interesting to know why that affiliation occurs. The close relationship between the two is well recognised. We saw this not long ago in Queensland when the Federated Clerks Union agreed to affiliate with the ALP. This was detailed in the Cooke report. The union was asked, `Why did you affiliate?', the cost being about $30,000. The answer was, `Well, we did not actually go and get all the unionists approval to do this, but we affiliated because it gave us ready access to Ministers and an ability to influence government policy'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is tantamount to a compulsory donation, regardless of whether the employee supports the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to look at the figures. Of those people who are members of the trade union movement, some 40 per cent vote for the Liberal Party. Yet, against their wishes, they are being compelled to support a political party of which they do not approve. We have seen just recently that the ACTU is planning to spend some $10m in a campaign against the coalition to oppose the Fightback package, doing so with a basically tax free status. I am simply making the point that groups that support the other political parties in Australia do not have the luxury of being able to claim tax deductibility on anything like that scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important condition of the full, fair and equitable disclosure is that donors must be protected against coercion and intimidation. The problem of disclosure and intimidation is very real. It is my hope that, with the increased penalties that were introduced in the 1991 Bill, sooner or later these provisions will be used, so that people will feel confident about donating to a political party and the lack of ramifications from doing so. All that said, these amendments do tidy up the original Bill, which were introduced in haste, and will go some way to making this cumbersome legislation more workable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In December last year the Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill was introduced by this Labor Government in an effort to bring to the country a new standard of ethics and propriety in the way in which political parties conducted their fundraising, and in the management of their funds. Since that time, the operations of the Act, which have applied since 19 December 1991, have identified a number of areas where alterations have been seen to be needed by all parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment of the Labor Government to disclosure of political donations has been evident since the Government came to office in 1983. Indeed, the Labor Party has had a commitment to the disclosure of donations to political parties well before that&mdash;for at least some 15 years now. I remind the House that in 1977, Mr President Sibraa, then a senator, moved a motion in the Senate to determine the best means of ensuring the public disclosure of resources and amounts of donations to political parties and candidates. That was opposed by the Liberal-National Party in 1977. He sought to do it again in 1979. Again, the Liberal-National Party opposed the Labor Party's efforts in the Senate to require an investigation of ways in which disclosure of donations to political parties could be better arranged in the public interest. In 1980, he moved a similar motion and, again, in 1980 the Liberals opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the Liberals and Nationals have been dragged kicking all the way in this debate. Whether it is a question of the pecuniary interest register for members in this place and in the Senate or whether it is a question of donations to political parties, the Opposition, the Liberal and National parties, have at every opportunity opposed it. It is with some regret that I have to say that the Liberals in Queensland have been worse than their counterparts in other States. Only a couple of years ago in the EARC inquiry in Queensland conducted by the Queensland Government, the Liberal Party's official submission opposed the disclosure of donations to political parties in Queensland. That was the official position put to the EARC inquiry in Queensland only two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the Liberal Party in Queensland has continued to demonstrate that desire to avoid, if it cannot oppose, the requirements of disclosure. In December of last year a letter from the State President of the Queensland Liberals, Mr Paul Everingham, solicited donations from a number of people throughout the State. I quote from his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need your help to maintain our operations now so that our research and policy support can continue. Any donation you make for maintenance purposes now is not disclosable. That may change&mdash;so act quickly.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And remember too, there is no requirement as yet, to disclose donations for Party maintenance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But please&mdash;act quickly!</PARA>
<PARA>He knew in December of 1991 when he wrote that letter that this Parliament was about to enact legislation that would have required disclosure. His response to that was to send out a letter to people in Queensland seeking their financial donations, to try to beat the law. But he went one better a short while after that. In January of this year the Queensland President of the Liberal Party, Paul Everingham, wrote again to people, soliciting support for donations and funds. Of course, by that stage, the legislation that we are now discussing was in place. But on 24 January he said this in his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please send me a cheque for whatever you can afford today. If you can't help with cash but can in kind, please let us know.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he very thoughtfully put a PS on the end of the letter which was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please note: Donations of $1500 or more are disclosable under new Political Funding Laws. If you wish to discuss this matter further I would be pleased to hear from you.</PARA>
<PARA>One could be forgiven for thinking that that was not just an encouragement to provide advice on the details of the legislation. One could forgive people for adopting the view that it may have been in the mind of the Queensland President of the Liberal Party to try to find ways of avoiding the Act, particularly in view of the stance to oppose disclosure that the Liberal Party in Queensland adopted as its policy position at its convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, if there is any doubt about what Mr Everingham may have been offering by way of advice, that was put to rest only a short while ago. On Friday, 10 April at a fundraising function for the Liberal Party held in the Mayfair Crest&mdash;the guest speaker at that function, I might add, was the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Mr Con Galtos, provided advice to those present. He said in summing up at the end of the evening that he knew that there were a number of business people who were keen to provide donations to the Liberal Party but were concerned that the new legislation required disclosure of their identity and the amount that they donated. He even gave an example. He said, `If you, for example, want to provide a truck load of paper to the Liberal Party head office but don't want anybody to know, see me afterwards'. That is what the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland said on 10 April at the Mayfair Crest at a function to raise money for the Liberal Party&mdash;and, I might add, to try to set up a Liberal Party branch in the central business district, which it evidently does not have at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no mistake about this chain of events. From 1977, when the Labor Party first sought the endorsement of this Parliament to do something about political disclosures, right through to the present, the Liberal Party has avoided, opposed and sought to undermine the disclosure provisions of the Act and the intentions which the Government has sought to set in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is a disappointment that the Queensland Liberals more than any other, it would seem, have adopted a tactic of trying to avoid the legislation&mdash;to beat it if they could&mdash;by sending out a letter a couple of weeks before the legislation was to be enacted which said, `Quick, give us the money now'. Then, after it was legislated, it sent out a letter saying, `I just want to remind you that if you give us more than $1,500 it will have to be disclosed. If you have any questions about that, give us a call'. Then at a function only a couple of weeks ago the Vice-President of the Liberal Party said quite bluntly, `If you want to drop a truck load of paper around to the Liberal Party office but don't want anybody to know, come and see me afterwards and we can arrange something'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might enlighten the House if the honourable member for Barker, who was at that luncheon, would tell us a few other things that were said. He was the guest speaker. With due respect to him, I suspect that he would have sighed with sorrow at the sort of comment that the Vice-President of the Liberal Party in Queensland came out with on that evening. There is no excuse for that sort of behaviour from the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech on the second reading the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), sought to make some political mileage by reference to Western Australia or to trade unions. Let there be no mistake about where this Government stands and where the Labor Party stands on these questions. For more than 15 years we have pursued the case for public disclosure of donations to political parties. We pursued it in the Senate in 1977 and we have pursued it in the Senate since that time. On every occasion&mdash;in 1979, in 1980 and on every occasion&mdash;the Liberal Party opposed it. They are points of history. The record stands for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment tidies up some of the problems that have become obvious in the new legislation. For that reason it has the support of all members in this House. There are a number of major provisions in the Bill to which I wish to refer. The Bill specifically seeks to decrease the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that amounts of less than $100 received from a person or organisation at a fundraising event need not be recorded in annual returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties with the current legislation as it stands is that it provides an upper limit which is a catch-all. Literally any payment made by or received by a registered political party is required to be disclosed. So we have a situation where, if we had an afternoon tea or a Saturday afternoon barbecue at which people might come along and pay $5 or $10, one would literally have to record the name of every person present and every hamburger or soft drink that they bought on the day. That sort of administrative trivia was never intended by the Parliament. It is a burden which is impossible in practical terms to place on the honorary officials and the supporters who in the main make up the branch network of registered political organisations. The amendment provides a maximum contribution of $100 being free from that disclosure provision, which is sensible without in any way undermining the important principles of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Bill decreases the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that payments of amounts less than $100 need not be recorded in annual returns. Again, the situation at present would involve political parties having to record the tea bags that are bought for the office. Any minor payment that in any other arrangement would be regarded as petty cash would, as the legislation now stands, require detailed paperwork and disclosure. That was not the intention of the Parliament. This amendment rectifies that difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill increases the time for agents to complete and furnish annual returns from eight weeks after the end of the financial year, as it is now, to 20 weeks after the end of the financial year. The legislation is quite rightly demanding on political organisations in requiring them to disclose all receipts and payments from all party units&mdash;not just the State office or the national office; not just regional executives; but all units of every political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the time that is involved for some of those honorary officials in collating that material and forwarding it to the State director or secretary of the relevant party, the current restriction of eight weeks does place a burden which would be difficult for any party in good faith to keep. Extending that time to 20 weeks provides all honorary officials with a realistic time in which to get their records completed and forwarded to their State offices for return to the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also allows agents furnishing returns to use the provisions of section 318 if necessary. This provision enables those who are unable to submit a complete return because someone else is in possession of the relevant information to nominate that person to the Commission and fulfil their obligations under the Act. I have just described the situation for local branch executives and the like. There could well be a circumstance in which a State secretary or director who under the Act is responsible for furnishing the return with the best of will is not able to get the information from the local branch officer. That may not be due to anything untoward on the part of the local branch officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has been involved in any honorary organisation will know that volunteers, with the best of will, do not always make the best office clerks. Even with the 20-week extension, a situation can arise in which a return is not provided. In this situation, as the law stands now, the State directors or secretaries would find themselves liable under the Act for a breach of the Act. This amendment enables the responsible person to identify those individuals who have not yet furnished the information and enables the Commission if it wishes to pursue that matter directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for easing the administrative burden on registered political parties by providing that financial records relating to minor fundraising events such as raffles are not required to be disclosed. This again is a commonsense alteration. Let us go back to the example I gave before of the afternoon tea or the barbecue. People might pay $10 for the barbecue and a couple of dollars for a few drinks and then buy a raffle ticket. Under the current legislation it could be said that there is a requirement to record their name and the amount paid on each one of those activities&mdash;every time they buy a drink, every raffle ticket they buy and every hamburger they eat. That does nothing to enhance the important tenets of the Bill with respect to disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment brings some commonsense to that arrangement and acknowledges that those minor payments&mdash;contributions of less than $100&mdash;need not be recorded as individual donations. It is important to add that that is not to say that those amounts of money are not recorded, because they are. They will be recorded in an aggregate way. It is simply that the breakdown of every single soft drink bought will not need to be maintained. The total amount of revenue earned from that venture will be recorded, and that is fair and reasonable, but the individual breakdown of every article purchased will not need to be disclosed under the provisions set out in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation introduced last year was good legislation designed to protect the interests of the voting public. It was designed to ensure that the people of Australia would be able to know who was donating money to political parties and where money that political parties spent went. It was not intended to place a burden on political organisations that prevented their proper functioning in our democratic system. It was not intended to require the disclosure, for example, of the personal salaries and conditions of employees of those political parties. It was intended to provide a guarantee to the public that there was available on the public record information about the pecuniary interests of the political parties themselves. That legislation was good legislation, and in many respects it was trendsetting legislation, certainly in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the fact that the Queensland Liberal Party does not like it, it is legislation which the people of Australia want and respect. Having said that, it is clear, after some months of that legislation having been in force, that the sorts of amendments to which I have referred, and the others contained in this Bill, are necessary, not to diminish the purpose of the legislation but to enhance it and to ensure that the legislation truly provides useful information to the public&mdash;not who bought the soft drinks at the last barbecue but where the significant contributions were from and where the significant payments were made. That is what the Bill will do. I am pleased to support it and I am pleased to see that the Opposition is also supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it is the last sitting evening of a very long session, I think honourable members might forgive the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) for that contribution. He is a member for whom I have great fondness, but he only fleetingly visited the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill in his contribution. We had a fairly wide canvass of a lot of current issues&mdash;at least current in the mind of the honourable member. Few of them actually dealt with the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inasmuch as he did deal with the Bill, and the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) raised some points, I would like to respond. The Liberal Party tells us tonight that it is supporting the Bill, and since the declaration of its Leader, the Leader of the Opposition, (Dr Hewson), it supports the concept of political disclosure. That was a development that was very warmly welcomed by the Government and the Labor Party. As the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) disclosed in his contribution, the Labor Party in this Parliament has, for many, many years, promoted the concept of full political disclosure so that Australians know who is actually putting money into their political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When governments make very big decisions that affect companies, trade unions and every Australian, the Australian people have some idea of where the money behind the parties is coming from. They know where the money that pays for the advertising and the campaigning is coming from. As the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, the Liberal Party has traditionally resisted the concept of disclosure very fiercely. Even though at a national level, in this Parliament, the leadership of the Liberal Party supports political funding disclosure, it is not a view which has been warmly embraced by all elements of the conservative parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, the State Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland are still quite stridently on the public record opposing political funding disclosure. The National Party has a very chequered history on these issues, particularly in Queensland. It is very strongly opposed to the concept of disclosure. The Liberal Party is lukewarm about this Bill at the Federal level, and it raises a few qualms. It says, `If you have disclosure, you open people up to threats and thuggery'. It always says, `If a business donates to the Liberal Party, then the trade unions are going to know which company that is, and they are going to move in and give it a hard time'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite hearing this claim from the Liberal Party and the National Party, and having listened to these debates when this Bill was first discussed, and again tonight, I have never actually heard one example of that occurring. It is always this `perceived' threat&mdash;a word the honourable member for Corinella used&mdash;of thuggery occurring. However, where we have seen some thuggery, and where we have seen some threats made, it has been on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to mind the famous statement of the Liberal Leader in Victoria, Mr Kennett, when he was talking about public servants who might dare to stand as candidates for the Labor Party in the State election. Mr Kennett's famous quote is, `If they are public servants and they stand for the Labor Party, they won't be public servants if they don't win the poll and they try to get back into the Public Service'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did indeed say that. I do not even need to go to Victoria to see what those in the Liberal Opposition might say, because I have lived in Queensland all my life and I have seen the National Party and the Liberal Party in operation. I suppose another fairly good example is that of Senator Mal Colston. Before the good senator was elected to the Parliament he had stood unsuccessfully for the Labor Party. At the time he stood he was a teacher in the employ of the Queensland Education Department. The retribution which Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his Government inflicted on Senator Colston for his nerve in actually declaring himself as a Labor Party supporter and a candidate for the Labor Party, of course, now forms part of the political folklore in Queensland. I do not need the nebulous example of unions, sometime in the future, maybe doing something if the donation is disclosed; we have actually seen things occur in Queensland. We have had the threat already of Mr Kennett.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the reference to Western Australia and where the money which the royal commission is inquiring into has led. Despite the hypocrisy of the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) and his rather sordid involvement in seeking  out funds from the gold industry in Western Australia&mdash;despite the hypocrisy of the Liberal Party having that issue within its own ranks&mdash;we can put that to one side because there are some very good examples in Western Australia which point to a very great need for legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very good example occurred during the last Federal election in the division of Stirling. As the House would recall, the result in Stirling was very close. The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) was returned by only a handful of votes. However, he was a good member and he managed, no doubt through his strong personal work in that electorate, to get himself over the line. Running against him was a very credible and strong Liberal Party opponent by the name of Jock Barker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barker has raised some very interesting allegations and questions about the funding of campaigns within the division of Stirling. They revolved around the fact that during the campaign a flier appeared and was sent, apparently, to about 1,500 small businesses and individuals in the electorate of Stirling. The flier was headed `An urgent message to people who make their living from business' and was directed to small business people. That flier stated, `At the time of writing, Jock Barker's campaign is in need of $20,000'. The flier said, `To guarantee the most effective campaign possible we need funds now', and decried the so-called evils of the Labor Party and urged people to make donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very interesting. This flier was sent out at that stage by Mr Ian Campbell, who was the president of the Stirling division. Subsequently, great honour has been bestowed upon Mr Ian Campbell, who is now&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;N-U-T-T. Mr Barker's letter to Mr Nutt says, `I want to make some inquiries about this flier that went out to small businesses in my electorate'. He said that the fliers were sent out without his knowledge, without his approval and that they were not authorised as part of his campaign. In fact, he says that his campaign workers were a bit annoyed because they were out there trying to gather some funds for their campaign, and suddenly the flier appeared in the name of Mr Campbell. That is all right. However, what is not all right is what has happened to the money. What has happened to the money?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Barker raised a few points in his letter to Mr Nutt. He said that the fundraising activity carried out using the flier which carried the name of his campaign was not associated with his campaign. That was point No. 1. Point No. 2 was that his campaign did not benefit in any way from the particular fundraising activity. So he got none of the money that was involved. Mr Barker said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who donated in response to the `flier' did so in the belief that they were assisting my campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact was that they were not assisting Mr Barker's campaign. Interestingly, Mr Barker goes on to point out that he believed that about $8,500 was raised. He asked whether some information could be supplied from Liberal Party headquarters as to what happened to the money. The letter continues. Mr Barker said that he had information that the flier was part of a direct marketing campaign being conducted by a company associated with the Liberal Party in Western Australia. It also appears that the people who ran the fundraising campaign were creaming off the top of the donations, supposedly going to Mr Barker's campaign, a little bit of commission for themselves&mdash;no doubt to cover expenses.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is hard to believe. We never see this sort of thing in Queensland. Apparently, it must be commonplace in Western Australia. Of course, this raises a few interesting issues. The first is what has actually happened to the money. Mr Barker said that he did not receive it. He asked the Liberal Party to respond to him concerning what had happened to the money and whether in fact it was disclosed. In his letter he said that he and his local campaign did not declare the money, because he did not receive it. He said that he had not seen any evidence of the money being disclosed. I am very pleased that the honourable member raised the spectre of Western Australia and, supposedly, all the evils which flow from Western Australia, because there does seem to be a bit of a problem over there. It seems to be very much centred on the Liberal Party. It seems that Mr Barker, for one, within the division of Stirling, had some very interesting questions to ask regarding the procedures adopted by the Liberal Party in the last Federal election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us back to the central theme: why do we need this legislation? We need the legislation so that we know where the money is going; so that we can follow the money trail. That is important in a democracy. The Liberal Party, not only in its economic and social policies but also, apparently, in its campaigning, is very fond of the American model. We have had the recent example of the gun-at-the-head poster which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was circulating and was a direct steal, it would appear, from a similar campaign poster used by the Republican Party in the State of Texas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now also have an American-style fundraising convention. This is the national convention which is not actually to discuss any Liberal Party policy. Do honourable members recall that one? This is the convention to which people can go to meet the leaders and the movers and shakers in the Liberal Party and feel good and buy a stall. People can set up their AMP stall or insurance stall and what have you and throw their money. Interestingly, if one believes the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I am only taking this from that publication because I have no other knowledge&mdash;one of the issues raised in particular by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) related to unions donating to the Labor Party so that they could get access to party leaders. It is quite clearly stated by the Liberal Party&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pointing out to the House before that unnecessary quorum, called by the Opposition to waste time&mdash;those in the gallery will note that absolutely no Opposition members are here&mdash;that the Liberal Party has very much embraced this American style of campaigning: not just the campaign leaflet showing a gun pointing at someone's head but also the idea of buying access to the leadership and to important people in the Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members believe what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> says, for a measly $10,000 one can get very good access to the Liberal Party leadership. People can see the Leader of the Opposition for $10,000. I suppose that is a bargain at any price! When we recall the example of fundraising by the Liberal Party candidate in the division of Stirling in Western Australia, when we recall the National Party fundraising concerning the Joh for PM campaign in 1987 and everything which flowed from that, we can see that Australia does need disclosure legislation. Tonight we are not simply discussing whether we should have such legislation but whether we should have some minor, and fairly technical, amendments to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments, as have been canvassed by most honourable members participating in the debate, will simply make the provisions a little more workable for the basic mass organisation of the parties, for the branch meetings and for ordinary party members in running their raffles and their basic fundraising activities, so that there is not an over-onerous burden placed on these people in keeping their records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are sensible amendments, and I am glad that both the Liberal Party and the National Party are supporting them. But I point out again that, even though they are supporting this Bill, deep down they still do not support the concept of disclosure. They do not support it throughout their various State elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) has pointed out, the Liberal and National parties in Queensland state very strongly in their submissions to the ERC that they do not support the concept of political disclosure. One does not have to wonder too hard as to why the National Party, particularly in Queensland, does not want to support political disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a terrible spectacle in Queensland, where virtually an entire National Party Cabinet is either on bail, awaiting trial, in gaol or out on parole at this stage. A lot of that is as a result of the misappropriation of public funds. It is no wonder that a party which attracts those sorts of people to its ranks is not particularly interested in having full and fair political funding disclosure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is for an Act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary due to recent developments overseas and in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members are no doubt familiar with the recent publicity concerning an Australian cyclist who tested positive for anabolic steroids and subsequently was able to avoid sanctions on a legal technicality. This has made the Government determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve. The amendments to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act proposed in this Bill will do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes provision for a coordinated and national approach to the elimination of drug abuse in sport. Honourable members may not know that over the past 18 months there have been extensive discussions on the subject of complementary State and Territory anti-doping legislation. At the meeting of all State and Territory sports Ministers last year, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was able to achieve unanimous agreement that such complementary legislation is desirable, and each State and Territory sports Minister gave a commitment to introduce such legislation. This Bill enables the Commonwealth to honour its undertaking to provide for that complementary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is at the leading edge of international developments in the fight against drugs in sport. Before this year, it had executed international anti-doping arrangements with Canada and the United Kingdom. This year New Zealand and Norway have joined Australia. A strategy to expand the list of participating countries is being developed. One of the Australian Sports Drug Agency's functions is to ensure Australia's compliance with these arrangements. This Bill will ensure that the Agency has the necessary authority to perform this function. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend a little time advising honourable members of the details of the proposed amendments. As I have indicated, this Bill makes provision for the Australian States and Territories to confer broader powers on the Australian Sports Drug Agency through complementary anti-doping legislation currently proposed by all States and Territories. It will also allow the Agency to work more closely with the States and Territories to ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach towards the elimination of prohibited drugs and doping methods in sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency will now test, both in Australia and overseas, a wider range of athletes for the presence of prohibited drugs. This will include foreign athletes when the test is sought by an overseas anti-doping authority, or when the test is conducted under a contractual arrangement which the Australian Sports Drug Agency may now enter into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agency must be able to recognise procedures adopted by foreign anti-doping authorities which conduct tests on its behalf so it can act on the result of those tests. These amendments will enable the procedures followed by such an authority to be recognised for the purposes of the Act, even if these procedures do not precisely mirror those set out in the Australian Sports Drug Agency regulations. The minimum standard to be adopted and recognised in such cases will now be that provided for in the International Olympic Charter Against Doping in Sport. This does not mean that there is anything wrong with the current regulations; it is merely an amendment which acknowledges that the Australian procedures are stricter and more precise than the internationally accepted standard of the Olympic charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides athletes with the opportunity to make a submission to the Agency challenging the validity of a positive test result, if the athlete considers that procedures in the following specified areas were not complied with:</PARA>

This will reduce the misconception that the entry of a person's name on the register implies some finding of `guilt'.

The question of guilt and application of sanctions is and has always been a matter for sporting organisations, not the Agency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Today I bring before the House a Bill to implement the Government's foreshadowed reform of product liability. The Bill represents the culmination of a process of legislative development which began over five years ago. The sorry state of Australia's existing product liability laws has been the subject of reports from the National Consumer Affairs Advisory Council, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission. All accept that an irresistible case exists for updating and simplifying the existing law. We need a system which promotes economic efficiency and provides justice to victims who suffer loss caused by defective products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Internationally, too, the need to make a manufacturer strictly liable for its defective products has been recognised in the development and implementation in the European Community of the 1985 EC product liability directive. Indeed, the EC directive appears in fact to be the emerging international standard for product liability legislation. I understand that, in our own region, the governments of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are also showing a clear interest in introducing legislation based on the directive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December last year the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, brought the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 before the Senate. That Bill followed the 1985 EC product liability directive in all important respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the extensive debate on this issue which had already occurred, he believed it was important to allow all interested parties adequate time to examine the terms of the Bill before it was debated. The senator therefore decided to introduce the Bill in December as an exposure draft and allow it to lie on the table over the Christmas recess. He undertook to conduct a full and comprehensive process of consultation and encouraged all who had an interest in the Bill to examine it carefully and provide any comments which they wished to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate received a great many submissions from a wide variety of sources in response to this offer, including consumer groups, peak industry bodies, commercial organisations, businesses and interested members of the public. These were of great benefit in considering the extent to which the language of the Bill met the policy objectives. A number of the suggestions and matters highlighted in the submissions have been taken up in the further development of the Bill. Both Senator Tate and I thank all those who have taken a genuine interest in this matter for their input into the process of the development of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has chosen to proceed with the changes to the 1991 Bill by withdrawing that Bill and introducing a clean Bill rather than by way of moving a series of Government amendments. As Senator Tate stated in his second reading speech in December last year, this reform is the most significant legislative development in the reform of consumer protection in recent times. It will assist all those with an interest in this matter to have access to a clear, consolidated Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, given the significant reforms introduced by this Bill, the explanatory memorandum is likely to be important in the development of the body of jurisprudence which will surround the new regime. It will therefore be beneficial for one definitive explanatory document to be produced to prevent confusion in the interpretation of the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Features of the Bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key features of the Bill are as follows. A manufacturer or importer of goods is to be strictly liable for defects in those goods. Goods are defective when they do not provide the degree of safety which persons generally are entitled to expect, taking into account all the circumstances including the way the goods were marketed or labelled, and the likely uses to which the goods will be put. This is an objective test: it is the objective knowledge and expectations of the community which determine whether a product is defective, not the subjective knowledge and expectations of the claimant. The claimant will not have to prove negligence. The difficulty in proving negligence is one of the factors identified in existing law which can lead to injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A product will not be held to be defective simply because a better, safer product is subsequently put into circulation. This should ensure that the regime does not stifle product development or innovation. Where a defect in a product results in someone being killed or injured, or where an individual's property is damaged as a result of a defect in goods, the manufacturer or importer is liable to pay compensation for that loss without the need for the person to prove that the manufacturer was negligent. The claimant will have to prove on the balance of probabilities that the product supplied by the manufacturer was defective, and that the defect in the product was the cause of the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of public record that the Government's intention in introducing this regime is that Australian consumers who are injured by defective goods should be placed in a position which is no less advantageous than that enjoyed generally by their European counterparts in the same situation. While on paper the EC directive places the burden of proof of all elements of the claim on the claimant, it should also be recalled that it was prepared on the understanding that member States would continue to utilise their existing rules of evidence and procedure in dealing with cases brought under the directive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice this means that, in many EC countries&mdash;including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, France and Italy&mdash;claimants have the advantage of a variety of procedural and evidentiary devices which assist plaintiffs to make out their cases. In some countries, it is said that the effect of these local rules will go so far as to shift the burden of proof entirely on a number of key evidential issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, under this proposal, it is clear that the onus of proof on the issues going to liability remains firmly with the injured person. Nevertheless, it is the Government's firm hope that in applying this legislation in the Australian context the courts in this country will wish to acquaint themselves fully with both the emerging jurisprudence in Europe and these procedural and evidential matters. It is vitally important that the interests of consumers and manufacturers alike be protected by ensuring that the new Australian law operates in a manner which is consistent with the laws in the marketplaces of our major overseas trade competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue will be the major challenge facing the courts as they come to terms with this new legislation. And, for reasons I will give in a moment, it will continue to be an issue for the Government and this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides a number of defences. Manufacturers will not be liable if they can show that the existence of the defect was incapable of being ascertained by any means&mdash;the state-of-the-art defence&mdash;or where the defect came into existence after the product left the manufacturer's control. A component manufacturer can escape liability if it can show that the component was only defective because of the design, markings, instructions or warnings of the product in which the component was incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manufacturer will also not be liable where the product was defective only because it complied with a mandatory standard imposed by a government. Where the sole cause of a defect was compliance with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth will be liable to compensate the claimant for the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the EC directive and the recommendations of the Industry Commission, compensation can be reduced or disallowed to take account of any acts of the claimant which contributed to the loss.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of one or more consumers who have a product liability claim. However, the Commission will be required to obtain the prior consent in writing of those claimants whom it is to represent. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reference of Issues to the  Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the Bill which was introduced last December followed the EC directive in all important respects. However, the Government has never believed that the directive represented the ideal product liability legislation. On the contrary, in many ways it represents the inevitable result of an attempt to achieve uniformity where a number of disparate interests are involved&mdash;a lowest common denominator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that the Bill introduced last year significantly differed from the EC directive in three important areas: the period of repose was extended from 10 years to 20 years in the case of personal injuries; overseas consumers were given the right to sue Australian manufacturers of defective products; and a provision was designed to ensure an injured person his or her day in court where it was reasonable to infer from direct and circumstantial evidence that a defect in the product caused the loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition to these elements threatened to once again delay the introduction of this important legislation and perpetuate the inequities recognised by all to be part of the current system. And, as I have already noted, injured Australians have already waited five years while this matter has been under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than allow further delay to occur, the Government has decided that the best course of action is to remove the controversial elements of the proposal for consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. These matters can now be examined in an objective and constructive way by an all-party committee of the Senate. This will provide the proper forum for those who have expressed concerns to articulate their views in a public way. It will also allow consumer groups to put their case publicly from a position of equal standing for the first time since these reforms were proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that in such a forum a range of issues which have hitherto been the subject of misapprehension can be dispassionately examined and that the true balance between the interests of consumers and manufacturers will become clear to all.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am satisfied that the enactment of these proposals will still represent a considerable advance for consumers and achieve my fundamental goal of getting the new foundations for product liability law firmly in place. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill primarily confers legal rights upon individuals to institute legal proceedings. No direct increase in public expenditure is required to administer the regime. There may be a need to consider increased funding for the Federal Court and the Trade Practices Commission if product liability becomes a significant part of their workload, but this is not likely to occur for some considerable time, if at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be costs arising from the imposition of Commonwealth liability for products which are defective solely because they complied with a mandatory standard imposed by the Commonwealth. The impact of Commonwealth liability for defective standards, however, is not expected to be great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will ensure that it is the person who was responsible for putting the defective goods into circulation who will be liable to compensate those people who are injured because of the goods. This will benefit the whole community. There will eventually be some increased cost to business as a result of the new law. However, European experience under a very similar regime has shown that this cost will be almost imperceptible in the initial years and very gradual after that. The Bill will also undoubtedly encourage improved design, evaluation and enhanced quality control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will not only create a more equitable system of rights, but will also improve Australia's overall economic efficiency. Australian manufacturers will be required to produce goods which meet this international standard as part of their push to achieve international competitiveness. I also believe that Australian consumers are entitled to the same level of protection as is available to consumers where the EC directive operates. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech just given by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) on the Trade Practices Amendment Bill was, of course, a prepared text, read by her faithfully, which was prepared for her by the office of the former Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). I must say that the new Minister read the speech faithfully and uttered everything that had been put in the prepared text. It is lucky that she does not know what lies behind this whole episode for, if she did, even she would have had pangs of conscience about the statements that she faithfully read from the prepared text to this House and through this House to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True it is that this Bill deals with the liability of manufacturers for defects in goods. But the fact is that this is the fourth version of the Bill. I will take the House through the way in which this Bill has developed over the last year, and I will show that, far from indicating that this Bill now comes before the House because the Government has listened and has had discussions and has come to agreement, this final version comes before this House because the former Minister, who twisted and turned and squirmed and tried to avoid it for 12 months, was finally forced to come down with it. This is the version of the Bill that the coalition argued for from the outset but on which the former Minister wasted a year of squirming and turning before he accepted it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between May 1991 and the present, the coalition has been rock solid on this Bill. The way in which this Bill comes into the House now indicates that we were right from the outset. This is an admission that we were right from the outset and if Senator Tate, the former Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, had listened to the coalition at the outset he could have saved himself one year, four drafts, cutting and pasting, squirming, arguing and losing to get to this final position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on another level, this is an illustration of how the Parliament can work. In this case we had a Minister with a bad proposal. He was a Minister of a government that had a majority in the Parliament that could have steamrolled, as it frequently does, bad legislation through. But as a result of public pressure, as a result of Opposition argument and, in the final analysis, as a result of a revolt from his own back bench, this Minister with bad legislation was forced to back down. In a way, it is an illustration of how the Parliament can actually work well. It is an example of the Parliament stopping a Minister with a bad proposal from proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all of those business groups which supported the coalition's stand on this Bill. There were so many of them&mdash;big and small&mdash;which, with one mind and one voice, came out and supported the position that we took on behalf of the Australian business community. I would like to thank them for courageously supporting the stand that the coalition took. I would like to thank the thousands of small business proprietors throughout this country who inundated my office and that of my colleagues, and I trust that of Senator Tate too, to draw attention to how bad his proposals were. They, too, played a very big part in changing the proposals that now come before this House. Those people supported the stand I took, the stand the coalition took and the stand which has been vindicated by the final form of this Bill tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big issue in argument over 12 months and four drafts in relation to this has been what may appear to be a technical legal argument in some respects but is so important in practice; namely, when it comes to proving liability, who should bear the onus of proof? This Bill seeks to introduce manufacturers' liability for defective products. The big issue that we argued about for nearly 12 months and that the Government has now conceded is that, in accordance with every other law allocating liability, and in accordance with the normal rules of civil procedure, `he who asserts must prove'. The plaintiff should bear the onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's original proposals were announced on 13 May 1991. It said that manufacturers would be liable for defects, but the onus of proof was to be imposed on the manufacturer. Products causing loss would be assumed defective unless proven otherwise. Senator Tate, in his press statement of 13 May 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the key question of who should bear the onus of proving a product is defective, the Government has reached a compromise position which should be acceptable to both industry groups and consumers. We have taken a lead from the Industry Commission which has said that it would be more economically efficient to require the manufacturer to show a defect does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA>It is reversal of the onus of proof. If a product caused loss it would be assumed defective until proven not defective. Senator Tate justified the Government's announcement on the grounds that it was the de facto effect of the EC law, but the EC council directive of 25 July 1985, however, was quite to the contrary. Article 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The injured person shall be required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between defect and damage.</PARA>
<PARA>If this article had the de facto effect of imposing the onus of proof on the manufacturer, one wonders why Senator Tate was not inclined to leave it there by merely adopting the EC wording. The fact that he was not, indicates he was not too sure it did have such an effect. The clue to his very strange position lay in the words of his press statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has reached a compromise position which should be acceptable to both industry groups and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate was holding out to industry that he proposed nothing other than the de facto situation in Europe, but by proposing to reverse the clear terms of the European directive, he wanted to hold out to consumer groups that he proposed something very different. When that proposal was first made, I issued a press statement on 13 May 1991 entitled, `Think again on Product Liability'. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new proposals are not the European directive which leaves the onus of proof with the claimant. This is the traditional position of the common law which requires that `he who asserts must prove'. The onus of proof should be left with the claimant.</PARA>
<PARA>By November 1991, Senator Tate realised he was in deep trouble on this and he reversed his position. He put out a press release saying that the onus of proof would not be statutorily reversed. In response, I put out a statement on 11 November 1991 entitled `Tate beginning to see the light'. I welcomed the fact that he had abandoned or announced the abandonment of his intention to reverse the onus of proof. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition will carefully scrutinise the detail of the Government's amended proposal and oppose any attempt to reverse the onus of proof through a back-door method.</PARA>
<PARA>We knew that there had already been an attempt to hold out different results to different groups. All we had was a statement that there would not be a reversal of the onus of proof. We wanted to be sure that Senator Tate did not take the advantage of ambiguity in further legislation and try to accomplish the same result with different words. That was our fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, our fear was proved absolutely correct because when the Bill next came out&mdash;this was the Bill of December 1991; this Bill actually got into the Senate&mdash;and was introduced on 19 December 1991 into the Senate, it was called the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. It had a proposed new section on the onus of proof, the famous section 75AJ, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a liability action, if, on the evidence (whether direct or circumstantial) and in all the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to infer that loss was caused by a defect in goods, then the inference must be made.</PARA>
<PARA>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what that meant and why it was there, because the point was that if this was going to be treated like any other liability regime, and if the onus of proof was going to be on the plaintiff&mdash;like it is in ordinary civil litigation&mdash;one did not need any of these sections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Tate was going to make good his promise of November 1991, it was very surprising that this actually appeared there. I asked myself the questions: what does it mean? Why is it there? Why is it necessary? If Senator Tate is showing good faith, why does he need a draft like this? The more I looked at it, the more I came to the conclusion that it was just another attempt in different words to affect the onus of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause became known as the little Aussie battler clause. The little Aussie battler clause was not going to reverse the onus of proof, it was somehow going to allow commonsense claims to proceed. The explanatory memorandum told us that it would ensure commonsense claims are not struck out on procedural or technical grounds. But there was nothing in the clause that tried to restrict it to commonsense claims. All claimants could take advantage of it. There was nothing in the clause that related to striking out statements of claim, no case submissions or anything like that. When the legal opinion came in, and some very good opinions were sought and obtained and provided to Senator Tate, they came to the same conclusion that I had and that was that in a very real way, the so-called little Aussie battler provision was a de facto reversal of the onus of proof and Senator Tate had not made good his promise of November 1991. That was the view that became apparent on what, by that stage, was the second proposal, the proposal of December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure I had something to say about that at the time, too. I made the point that the famous section 75AJ, as it then was, was unnecessary and ought to be deleted. Then we came to the third draft of the Bill. The third draft of the Bill did not even get into the Parliament, it had such a short life. It was produced on 27 April and comprehensively leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. This had another version of the so-called little Aussie battler provision, although now it was not called section 75AJ. By this stage, I think it was called section 75AL. This was another provision again and another attempt at different wording to try to produce an ambiguous and duplicitous purpose. Section 75AL read like this, `In considering whether a liability action is to be stayed or dismissed, if on the evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, and in all the circumstances of the case it is reasonable to infer that loss was caused by defect in goods, then the inference is to be made'. I might describe that as the little, little Aussie battler provision. It was getting `littler' by this stage, but it was still mired in confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we had the little, little Aussie battler provision, which was draft three. That one did not even get into the Parliament, as I said, because on 6 May&mdash;honourable members will not see anything about this in the prepared script they gave the Minister for Consumer Affairs; they did not tell her about this, they just stuck her up with the prepared script&mdash;the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs was forced by the back bench of the Labor Party to withdraw it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The back bench of the Labor Party showed a lot of wisdom on this. Bernard Lagan in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 7 May 1992 reported that the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, had been forced by his back bench to withdraw key parts of his consumer protection Bill and water it down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the third proposal&mdash;the proposal of 27 April 1992 that did not even get into the Parliament. I think that again I put out a statement on that one, saying, `Caucus right; Tate wrong'&mdash;and they were. One of the Labor backbenchers who is going to speak in this debate interjected earlier and said, `The back bench is always right'. Well, if the back bench is always right, and it was right on this, I will hold the honourable member to his promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate has not given up yet. He wants to take this to a Senate committee. He wants to have another shot and try to convince the Senate committee that the decision previously was wrong. So I am going to watch what those on the back bench say in the debate. If the back bench is and was right, they will oppose Senator Tate in the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then along came the fourth Bill. This was the Bill of 26 May 1992 which Senator Tate introduced into the Senate. When I say, `introduced', herein lies an interesting tale because over in the Senate it appears that Ministers can sometimes just table their speeches. They do not have to actually read them; they are incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. That is what Senator Tate did. The trouble is that he had the wrong speech incorporated. The speech that was incorporated in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as the second reading speech for this Bill was the wrong speech. It was the speech on the third draft of 27 April 1992. Honourable members can look it up at page 2662 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It addresses the little Aussie battler provisions. There is a nice little section on the little Aussie battler provisions which were thrown out by the Caucus. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say one thing for the Minister for Consumer Affairs. She may not have known what she was reading, but at least she read the right speech. She was a step ahead of Senator Tate who put in the wrong one. She is off to a good start. She does not need to know what she is reading, but I will give her a word of advice: when they come to you with a speech, you say to them, `Is this the right one?'. That is what you have to say to them because they may in fact give you the wrong one and you would not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Minister another word of advice: read the title. Make sure that the speech that they give you relates to the Bill being introduced. When there are four drafts, of course it is pretty hard to make sure one gets the right one. The one that Senator Tate had incorporated was the wrong speech. It did not even have the part in it that the Minister read out about how he is going to go to the Senate and fight before the Senate committee for the little Aussie battler provisions, extraterritoriality and the statute of repose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appeared, of course, from his press release of 7 May after he conceded defeat. I call this his `We will fight them on the beaches' press release. This is the one that said, `Well, look: I lost my first draft, I lost my second draft and I lost my third draft and I put in the wrong speech for my fourth draft&mdash;but we will fight them on the beaches, we will fight them in the House, we will fight them in the Senate and we will fight them in a Senate committee and, despite this decision, I am confident that we will have positive change in product liability laws, and everybody can have their day in court on these controversial elements and everybody can come up to the Senate committee'. What he is saying is, `Please come up to the Senate committee and do what I never could, which was to persuade my colleagues. Please do that'. This is the office that puts in the wrong speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make a point about this which will interest the Minister. There have been changes in the law so that when there is a doubt about a Bill one can look to the second reading speech for clarification. That is why in the speeches there is a phrase that is read out about how it is hoped that as the courts come to terms with this new legislation they will take various attitudes and so on. That is why those words are put in there&mdash;so that when the courts come to interpret legislation, if there is any ambiguity they look to the second reading speech. Well, it will not be of much help to them if they look at the second reading speech and it is the wrong one. The court might say, `Let us look at what the Minister said to work out what this means. Let us look at the second reading speech'. In this case they would be looking at the wrong speech. It is an indication of how confused the Government is and how badly this whole matter has been managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say to the Minister as the new Minister for Consumer Affairs is that there is an object lesson here and the object lesson is that this Bill, which will now go through the House with our agreement because it reflects the position we took from the outset, is in a final form and it does not need playing around with. If the Minister were to try to get it to draft five, draft six or draft 66, she would run the risk of running into problems. That being said, we are now at the position where the Bill, which takes the view that we took at the outset&mdash;that the onus of proof should be on the plaintiff&mdash;can be supported by the coalition. Now that that main part has been settled, this Bill does do some good things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it has come to liability in the past, liability has been allocated under common law through the law of negligence and the reasonable man test. It has been allocated through contract where parties agree on terms which allocate laws as between themselves. There has been statutory intervention; indeed, there are already provisions in the Trade Practices Act known as division 2A which allocate liability between consumers on the one hand and manufacturers on the other. This proposes to go further in relation to that and, as has been said, is a liability proposal based on the European directive. The rationale behind changing current product liability laws in Australia is that allocation for loss should in more cases be cast on manufacturers. The EC directive is an attempt to allocate loss arising in countries which are members of the European Community. In the United States allocation of loss is principally made under the law of negligence. The test in the United States is `defective condition unreasonably dangerous'. The test in the EC directive is `defective'; that is, a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which a person is entitled to expect taking all circumstances into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what will have to be done when assessing whether a manufacturer is liable is to decide whether something was defective, meaning whether it provided the safety which a person is entitled to expect. The Bill goes on to set out various matters that can be considered as part of that. Of course, a large portion of the products consumed in Australia are produced for global markets. If producers selling products in the European market are required to comply with the EC standard, they will automatically comply with any Australian requirement based on that EC standard. If the Australian standard were lower, this could open the opportunity to dump inferior goods on the Australian market. If the Australian standard were higher, this could prevent access to internationally available goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument&mdash;a good argument&mdash;to harmonise our law with that of the EC and I welcome the fact that this Bill goes along that path. I hope that this Bill will provide a regime which is clear, concise and can easily be understood by manufacturers and by consumers alike. I hope that this will lead to shorter cases in the court rather than longer cases. I note, however, that the proposals in this Bill do not take away the current regimes, either the common law regimes or the current trade practices regimes. So in any cases that do come into the courts there will be joint courses of action under common law and</PARA>
<PARA>under the Trade Practices Act. The various tests that have to be applied will have to be assessed by the judge or, if it should be the case, by the jury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not give this provision such extraterritorial effect as would allow people who consume Australian products outside Australia and suffer loss from them to come into the Australian jurisdiction and sue Australian manufacturers under this regime. I think the countries in which Australian products are consumed should set the legal regime that applies to those products. If loss is suffered in those jurisdictions, claims for compensation should be brought in accordance with those jurisdictions. If an Australian manufacturer makes a product that causes a loss to somebody in South Korea, the case is brought in accordance with the legal regime applying in South Korea rather than repatriating the legal case back to Australia and bringing it into the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could have that extraterritorial effect and repatriate legal cases from the place where the loss was suffered back to the Australian jurisdiction, we would effectively be creating an export industry for lawyers, because lawyers in Australia would be getting clients who might be domiciled in such places as South Korea, the Philippines or Thailand. It might create an export industry for lawyers and it might do something for an increase in litigation in the Australian courts, but I doubt whether it will do anything for Australian manufacturers or Australian producers. If I had to make a choice between what I considered to be in the national interest, helping our manufacturers with exports or helping our lawyers with exports, I would be inclined to take the view that our manufacturers ought to be given a better hearing by this Parliament than our lawyers&mdash;with no disrespect to our lawyers, who may be upset by my choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that manufacturers in Australia have had enormous difficulties in recent times. They face all sorts of inhibitions on their competitive position. These are the people who have to put up with payroll taxes and superannuation levies; the people who have to put up with the recession we had to have; the people who have to put up with a bad transport system that does not work efficiently enough; and the people who over the years have made a great contribution to the Australian economy. I do not think this is the time to be making things more difficult for our manufacturing sector, particularly our manufacturing export sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to introduce a regime that had extraterritorial effect, particularly if we put it together with a reversal of the onus of proof, as was originally proposed, we would be turning Australia into a high risk zone for manufacturing and a highly sympathetic zone for litigation. We should not make Australia a high risk zone for manufacturing. We in Australia ought to be thinking about getting competitive advantage for our manufacturers rather than competitive disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are all sorts of reasons why the Minister ought to lock this Bill in her bottom drawer and forget about it. She has seen what has happened to Senator Tate. Senator Tate's body is hardly cold. He has had a lot of trouble on this Bill. It is finally being put to rest. I suggest to the Minister that she take out a big key, put this in the bottom drawer, lock it up and say, `What a relief. We got through that one. Draft four was enough. Let us not try for draft five or draft six'. If the Minister feels a rush of blood, and if Government members get to her and say, `Look as if you're doing something, Minister', she should talk to Senator Aulich. Senator Aulich was right on this one. He is the one who rolled Senator Tate. He is the one who took the view that finally prevailed. He is the one who supported the coalition's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government asks me, `What is your position?'. I made our position crystal clear. It has been clear for 12 months. It has not changed an inch. The Government has been all over the place. It has had first draft, second draft, third draft, fourth draft, Senator Tate, Senator Aulich, and wrong speeches. It has been up to Broken Hill and back again. Our position has been absolutely clear right from the start. There is good in this Bill. Once the onus of proof and the extraterritoriality were settled, we said that it was a good Bill. We will support it for that reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday night of this week, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) made certain allegations in her speech about the work practices and ethics of the Endeavour Foundation in Queensland. I speak here with an interest because for many years I have been a vice-patron of the Endeavour Foundation for the Mackay branch. The allegations that were made have been brought to the attention of the Foundation. I understand that it has responded by way of a letter to all members of the Queensland Parliament on all sides of the political fence, and that has been circulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that the implications made by the honourable member for Forde in her speech were so grave that perhaps, as this is the last opportunity to set the record straight, I should endeavour to do that on this occasion. In her speech, the honourable member for Forde claimed she had been approached by a lady named Elizabeth who complained about a reduction in the amount she was to be paid by the Foundation for working in the Endeavour mailing and printing service, which is a sheltered employment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this statement the honourable member was correct, but only to the extent that a reduction in supplementary pay based on productivity had occurred for all people working in the Endeavour mailing and printing service. The reason for the reduction in wages was quite simple: sales reduction in the recession, a recession that the Labor Party said we had to have. It was made clear by a letter and personal explanation to every individual using the sheltered workplace services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out clearly that sheltered employment services are not fully funded for disability support costs by government and they must direct a large proportion of their commercial income to the cost of the care workers and trainers. They provide human services for this, and it has always been their first priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Endeavour mailing and printing service, however, had suffered as a result of the recession losing some major contracts, and there was a general decline in the printing industry. After an inner bid to keep the service going without affecting client income and supplements, Endeavour had been forced to retrench two of its experienced staff members, and this had been advised to the honourable member for Forde. Ultimately, even this measure was insufficient. So, faced with the prospect of having to close the service down altogether, the Foundation took the route of reducing the client income supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also claimed that Elizabeth, a person with an intellectual handicap who lives in her electorate, said that she was subnormal and not allowed to have children. But by implication the honourable member was saying that the Endeavour Foundation controls the lives of all those people who use its services. People with an intellectual handicap choose to use the services provided by Endeavour, and they are helped in this choice by their parents. This relationship does not allow for, or suggest in any way, that Endeavour is in a position to dictate to its clients how they live their lives. It is rather appalling&mdash;and the Foundation finds it appalling&mdash;that this inference was actually made. In fact, the Endeavour Foundation community is committed to empowering people with intellectual handicap to make decisions about their lives. That is why the mere inference of this is so offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also suggested that Elizabeth was in possession of a letter from the Foundation that stated her salary had been reduced from $68 per fortnight to $15 per fortnight and that that was part of the Federal Labor Government's policy. A letter was, as previously stated, sent to all individuals using the workshop services. The letter made no mention whatsoever of the Federal Government's policy and made no mention of the amounts. It was also claimed that Elizabeth was never paid $68 a fortnight, as the honourable member stated in her speech. In fact, the income supplement was actually reduced by $10 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member also suggested that the Federated Clerks Union intervened in Foundation work practices on behalf of EMPS employees and that the Foundation cut the pay of clients under the slow worker award. She also suggested that clients' pay was cut in this manner while no change was made to the pay of the administrators or clerks at EMPS. The fact is that, while the Federated Clerks Union did contact Endeavour, it made no representation on behalf of clients and claimed no interest in the situation because the union does not cover handicapped persons in that way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the loading was about to commence, it was discovered the coils had not been de-scaled. The coils were returned to the mill for de-scaling and re-rolling. As a consequence, the ship was delayed, through no fault of the waterside workers. When they returned to the wharf, the coils had been reduced from the original 20 tonnes to 10 tonnes each in weight. Loading proceeded normally. When all the available coils had been loaded, it was discovered that there were four coils missing. Subsequently, the missing coils were located in another area of the plant. The further delay to the loading of the ship, caused by the four missing coils not being delivered to the wharf, had not been the fault of waterside workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the four coils were delivered to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stamar</EMPHASIS>, a gang of waterside workers had to be diverted from another ship to complete the loading.

When the loading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stamar</EMPHASIS> was completed, one would imagine that the ship could sail without any further delay. However, it then became necessary to discover whether or not the purchaser would accept the smaller 10 tonne coils.

One of the most important things in Australia today is value added product. The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) has a committee looking at the problems in the sugarcane industry.

On this side of the House we have a whole range of relevant committees of importance to Australia, and on the Opposition side there are no committees. The only committee it has set up in this session of Parliament is a committee to promote the flag. That is the choice that the Australian people are going to be faced with at the next election.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Tuesday in  debate on the One Nation statement I made reference to the growing size and the growing problem of Australia's foreign debt. Following me in the debate, in seeking to rebut what I said about the size of Australia's foreign debt, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) had a few words to say, including these:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members opposite can play with the figures and talk about the magnitude of the foreign debt but the facts are that, as a proportion of the economy, the foreign debt is not as big as it was when they ran this country. The growth of the foreign debt under Labor has not been as great as it was when the Liberal Party ran this country.</PARA>
<PARA>The basis on which the honourable member for Brisbane made that assertion was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>, which he quoted, and which, to be fair to him, I shall quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . though the total overseas debt is now higher, the rate at which it grew, namely 38 per cent when they were in power&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Liberal-National coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is considerably higher than the rate of growth of 28 per cent since 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition members might have a closer look at the facts before deciding to parade foreign debt as a virtue in terms of their economic record.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Brisbane ought to have a closer look at the facts because they certainly do not support anything that he was asserting. In fact, one could put it in terms of that well-known quotation, `Lies, damned lies and statistics'. What he has done is make a selective use of statistics, and statistics which in a sense are misleading into the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the facts? Let us go back to 1975-76. Australia's net foreign debt was $2.3 billion. That represented 3.1 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beale" NAMEID="OE4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much was that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $2.3 billion. By 1981-82 it was $16.5 billion, or 10.5 per cent of GDP. So we had a situation in 1975-76 where the net foreign debt of Australians was the equivalent of approximately $200 per Australian. By 1981-82 it was about $1,000 per Australian. In 1982-83, when the Hawke Government came to office, the foreign debt was $23.3 billion, or 13.6 per cent of GDP. So at the start of the Hawke Government the actual foreign debt in terms of every man, woman and child in Australia was $1,500 per Australian. In 1990-91 that foreign debt had blown out, in net terms, to $137 billion, or 36.4 per cent of our gross domestic product. We learn that this month our net foreign debt is $148 billion, and that represents approximately $8,000 for every man, woman and child in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member for Brisbane to come in here and assert somehow that the foreign debt under the Hawke-Keating Government has improved or is in some way better than it was under the Fraser Government is simply playing with statistics in a way which cannot be backed up. The average growth of foreign debt&mdash;even the average annual growth of foreign debt&mdash;is not a satisfactory measure because it is affected by inflation and exchange rate movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fraser Government the average share of GDP gross debt represented 14 per cent of GDP. That compared with 13 per cent under the Whitlam Government. Even at the end of the Fraser Government it was still 14 per cent of GDP. The situation is that we have a foreign debt of $148 billion, which is growing. If we go to the background statement in the One Nation package, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) released, we see a statement that suggests it will grow by around $30 billion, and will continue to grow. EPAC said in its statement yesterday that if the current slow pace of adjustment continues, foreign debt will not be stabilised until the next decade, and will still be about 37 per cent of GDP in 2010. I can only suggest to the honourable member for Brisbane that he get his facts correct. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In contrast to the wholesale sales tax, the Goods and Services Tax is a straightforward tax for business.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me say to the House that only 70,000 businesses collect wholesale sales tax at the last stage in the wholesale stream. Under the Opposition's proposals 800,000 businesses&mdash;every small business in this country plus another 1,200,000 organisations&mdash;will be up for a goods and services tax and the filing of returns. The document further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Goods and Services Tax will not necessitate the gathering of more accounting information than is already collected by most businesses, it is clear that, where businesses do not currently pay wholesale sales tax, the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax will involve some additional compliance responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition says, `Some additional compliance responsibilities; not too much&mdash;only another 730,000 of you will have to submit returns. But these obligations will bring benefits'. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement for smaller firms to maintain better accounting records, thus providing a more informed basis on which to make management decisions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What an insult. What a put-down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to continue with what I was saying earlier about the Endeavour Foundation. No Endeavour Foundation clients come under the slow worker award and, as for the pay of administrators and clerks, EMPS employs one manager, one clerk and, as already stated, has retrenched two printers in a bid to avoid reducing client income supplement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems incredible that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) did not know these simple facts. Her statement suggests that she is also unaware of the amount her own Government has spent on consultants trying to arrive at a supportive wage and also of the findings in this area of the government sponsored Ronalds report. The honourable member for Forde suggested that Endeavour `is unable to move down the path of training or indeed make any other kind of progress'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is patently untrue. I can guarantee that because I have seen the progress of Endeavour over the 20 or 30 years that I have been associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of parliament, the honourable member for Forde would have received all the Foundation's newsletters and reports clearly outlining the considerable progress made by the Endeavour Foundation in all areas of disability services. Indeed, the information she has had at hand indicates that not only is the Foundation a leader in the service area, it also has the support of people with intellectual handicaps, their families, friends and, in fact, the entire Queensland community. I can vouch for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then goes on to suggest that the Foundation luxuriates in a headquarters building that has gold plated taps and toilets, a boardroom, banquet room and other facilities, and that this building is not available for use by people with intellectual handicaps. Once again, this is a distortion of the facts. Back in 1953 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in Brisbane ran a spot-the-ball competition and donated the funds raised to the recently formed Queensland Sub-Normal Children's Welfare Association, now the Endeavour Foundation. With that money, the organisation bought an old building, in much need of repair, in a then unpopular part of the city. That building is today called Schonell House and is part of Queensland's history. Endeavour's obligation as the owner of such a building is to maintain that building to an appropriate standard. So the toilets and bathrooms have brass taps, as originally fitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building is constantly in use by the Foundation&mdash;I have been there myself&mdash;and by other charity groups which provide services to people with a range of disabilities, as well as other community groups. It is commonly used for major seminars and training purposes involving the community, clients, other service providers and also government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then goes on to suggest that the Foundation is exploiting the people for whom it provides services. She then says, as if to verify that claim, that the person at the centre of her tirade, Elizabeth, is competent to do many more things than those tasks she was given at EMPS and is capable of earning much more than the $15 per fortnight the honourable member claims the Foundation paid her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Endeavour does not chain people to benches or coerce or manipulate them in any way. People with intellectual handicap come, either directly or through their families, to the Foundation seeking places in sheltered employment or other day programs. Despite the lack of government support, the Endeavour community strives to make more places available each year. In this regard I can vouch that in my time as shadow Minister for community services the Endeavour Foundation was probably the best funded by the community of most of the associations involved in this work. Perhaps the real complaint that the honourable member for Forde has is that the independence of the organisation allows it to do as it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Endeavour's clients receive assistance in developing work related skills and undertake specific task training as dictated by the clients themselves through an individual program plan, either directly or through their chosen advocates. They are paid a productivity based income supplement and are assisted in seeking other or open employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In actual fact the Foundation is delighted to know that a past client has found full and open employment in the honourable member's office and is sure that the honourable member for Forde, with all her knowledge of the disability services area, will ensure that Elizabeth is paid full award wages that are the same as those paid to other workers in the office and commensurate with her duties, and not the slow worker wage that the honourable member seems vaguely acquainted with or the supportive wage about which there is a fair amount of ignorance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is necessary to put on record that there are many members of parliament from Queensland on both sides of the House&mdash;Labor, Liberal and National&mdash;who have given their support to the Foundation over many years and who will continue to do so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The best thing we can give those kids today is the self-satisfaction when they go home at the end of the day of knowing that they have done something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to this garbage for a few weeks now, and I am sick to death of it. The Government can train the kids all it likes, but if there are no jobs, the kids will lose their confidence and be disfranchised for life. I can understand why some people in the Government would not understand what a day's physical work is about. Most of them have come out of some institution that they went into early in life, pleading the bleeding heart for certain groups of people, but they have never done it themselves. I venture to say that more people on this side of the House have actually done the physical, than any on the government side of the House. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that all of us need training; all of us need discipline. The very best time to get it is when we are young.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The five minutes available to me in the adjournment debate will not allow me to make the comments I would like to make. I will open by saying that I support the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). As someone who employed people in what would have been called by those on the other side of the House as dead-end jobs, I can vouch for the fact that they need not be dead-end jobs at all. Ironically in the fruit picking industry, those who went into an enterprise bargaining system, where they agreed how much they would be paid per bin instead of an hourly rate, found that far from being dead-end, the job was quite fulfilling, and there are those who have made successful farming careers as professional fruit pickers in my area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am forced to my feet in this extended adjournment debate to respond to the remarks made by the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) and by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). To imply that the GST is some sort of burden placed on Australia's small business is so far from the mark that I could not remain seated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of a GST is to relieve the cost burden currently being borne by small business. The honourable member for Shortland made so much of what he saw as the payroll tax that was not being paid by small business. I could not believe that a professional person, an informed person, a person with sufficient nous and intellect to occupy a seat in this Parliament, could propose that small business does not carry part of the payroll tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is like my fruit growers or farmers saying, `I only employ one or two people, so I do not pay payroll tax'. I have had one or two who have said that. That raised scorn and derision from the rest of the people in the room as they recognised that the products they produced&mdash;let us say it is citrus fruit that has to be packed into a case in a packing shed, processed into a can in a processing plant, which is normally a cooperative&mdash;caused them to pay payroll tax. The payroll tax becomes part of the burden borne by that small business. That cascading effect applies right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just as erroneous to come in here and tell me that sales tax does not place a burden on the food industry and that bread is without sales tax. Do honourable members seriously believe that Tip Top or Baker Boy, or the equivalent eastern States baking house, does not pay payroll tax? Of course it does. What about on the packaging? Of course it does. Where is it picked up? It is picked up in the price of a loaf of bread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members seriously believe that any one of the grocery items sitting on supermarket shelves in Australia does not carry some portion of wholesale sales tax, some portion of payroll tax and a substantial portion of petrol excise, simply to get it on the shelf? Of course it does. Every one of those costs is a cost borne by the consumer who buys that loaf of bread, that kilogram of butter, or whatever it may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that very reason, the removal of sales tax, the removal of petrol excise and the removal of payroll tax, has an immediate effect not only on small business but also on every consumer. Of course, it is replaced by a GST; we have not denied that. In fact, it is time for those in the Government to pause and ask themselves why on earth an opposition, seeking to dupe the Australian community as they allege, would come out 18 months before a poll deliberately indicating all that it intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Releasing a 700-page package is hardly being deceptive. If we had wanted to dupe the Australian people we would have gone to the election without indicating what our process was. We have put together a package that we believe offers not simply an alternative, but a responsible alternative&mdash;an alternative that will appeal to the Australian people and an alternative that those opposite can torpedo only by misrepresentation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Prime Minister's pledge at the start of the One Nation strategy to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy he can muster, is the Commonwealth Grants Commission giving pre-eminence to the goal of growth of employment in Australia in its corporate planning and policy development; if so, (a) how is pre-eminence being given, (b) in what ways is the goal being implemented and (c) are there any organisational activities which are inconsistent with maximising employment growth.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Administrative Services has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Grants Commission has no statutory or policy responsibilities for the development or maintenance of employment-creating programs within the Australian economy. The primary function of the Commission is to provide advice to the Commonwealth Government on the distribution of general revenue grants between the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission is required to base its recommendations on principles of fiscal equalisation. Under these principles the Commission's recommendations, if accepted by the Government, would enable each State to provide government services at standards not appreciably different from the standards provided by the other States, without having to impose taxes and charges at levels appreciably different from the levels imposed by the other States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making its assessments, the Commission takes account of</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) differences in the capacities of the States to raise revenues; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) differences in the amounts required to be spent by the States in providing government services of a comparable standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that levels of unemployment are higher in some States than in others, and the differences serve to reduce relative revenue raising capacities or increase relative service delivery costs in those States, the Commission's assessments would result (other things being equal) in higher per capita shares of general revenue grants for those States compared to the States where unemployment was lower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time, the implementation of fiscal equalisation principles in this way (i.e. through the differential distribution of general revenue grants) will act in the direction of providing additional stimulus in States with above average unemployment. To the extent that, overall, actual employment remains below full employment levels, other fiscal and monetary policies are called on to address the problem. These are outside the Grants Commission's responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the foregoing, the supplementary elements of the question under (a), (b) and (c) are not relevant to the operations of the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Administrative Services does not produce a directory which lists all potential funding sources available to the community, although it does produce a Commonwealth Government Directory (listing details of Commonwealth Government departments and agencies and senior personnel) in both book form and as an on-line service through Telecom's Discovery and Keylink systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more simple document, the Service Guide, which included limited information relating to grants, was discontinued in 1981 due to difficulties in keeping the information up-to-date.</PARA>
