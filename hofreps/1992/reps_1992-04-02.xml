<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will advise the House of the reasons for the power failure that occurred last night at about 6.40 p.m. Part of the building was blacked out and the lighting in the Senate chamber was reduced. The power failure was caused by a fault in ACT Electricity and Water Telopea Park zone substation. It was not caused by anything within the Joint House Department's purview. The power was lost to one of the two primary feeders to Parliament House. The emergency generators did not operate, as they only operate when both feeders fail. The power was restored in the building in about a minute, and power was restored to the building by ACT Electricity and Water within five minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report deals mainly with the movement of containerised cargo through Australia's major ports. It follows over 10 years of widespread criticism of the performance of the waterfront, criticism that has concentrated on the movement of goods across the waterfront but has not considered what happens when they move between the wharf and the warehouse. The performance of the waterfront had to be improved and action to achieve that improvement is under way. However, almost eight years after the extravagances and inefficiencies of the transport chain between the warehouse and the wharf began to be exposed, little has been done to remove them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for this failure to act rests squarely on the shoulders of importers, exporters, transport chain participants and their respective industry organisations. The inquiry has revealed an appalling apathy, ignorance and inertia on the part of users of waterfront services. Participants along the chain have each operated within their own discrete worlds, without regard to the impact of their actions on the overall efficiency of the chain. Much of the evidence presented to the Committee had been heard before by either the Webber Committee on shore based shipping costs in 1984 to 1986 or the Inter-State Commission from 1986 to 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason for the apathy could be the unawareness of the individual cost components of the services utilised. This arises from the lack of a direct commercial relationship between importers-exporters and the service providers. Alternatively, it may be that, despite all the rhetoric from some industry organisations, individual firms have not seen waterfront costs as a priority. The Australian Shipping Users Group, in its response to a Committee question relating to the ignorance displayed by the importers-exporters community, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not a case of ignorance/disinterest as much as a question of priorities. Individual firms do not see the waterfront as a key issue compared with other more pressing problems (maintaining sales, avoiding industrial disputes) and so do not accord it, or its problems, a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA>This may also explain why in many firms, people responsible for transport decisions are well down the totem pole. Whilst improved efficiency, reliability and lower transport costs may not be a priority for individual firms, taken collectively they are major issues in helping Australia become more competitive in domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvement in the efficiency of the sea-land transport interface has the potential to give a boost to the Australian economy in its early stages of recovery. This would come from a sharp reduction in indirect costs as well as a reduction in direct costs. Recent studies by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, conducted on behalf of the Committee, show that real shore based shipping costs have declined by almost 20 per cent between 1985 and 1991. Most of this improvement related to on-wharf services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommends improved communication and flexibility within the interface, which should significantly improve Australia's reputation as a reliable trading partner. With this enhanced reliability, Australia's importers and exporters will have the opportunity to take advantage of modern management techniques which are so important to successful international trade. Reliability is the key to improving our trade performance. How to improve that reliability and its relationship to interface operations is the substance of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report departs from the ritualistic `bashing of the waterfront' to concentrate on the performance of participants in the chain from the warehouse to the wharf. The Committee focused its attention on those participants and those practices which have escaped close scrutiny in the past. The inquiry found a prevalent attitude among participants of blaming each other for the inefficiencies, expense and failings of interface services. It was a case of `it was always someone else's fault'. It is clear that if participants in the chain from the warehouse to wharf started talking to each other rather than about each other, Australia's trade effort would quickly benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry the Committee published a discussion paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">From Warehouse to Wharf</EMPHASIS>, which canvassed industry response to issues which the Committee had identified as problems. The excellent response to the discussion paper from both service providers and users is an indication of an improving atmosphere for change within the sea-land transport interface. The discussion paper highlighted the need for urgent improvements in the sea-land transport interface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major issues identified during the inquiry were: a lack of information on who pays who for what and why; a lack of coordination and planning within the transport chain; the need for attitudinal change among service providers and the users of the transport chain; the need for industry users to become more involved in industry policy decisions and to monitor the level of service which is provided to them; a cumbersome documentary system which needs to be standardised, simplified and streamlined; the requirement to clarify and simplify international financial documentary requirements; the slow introduction of electronic data interchange throughout the transport chain; problems with infrastructure development; and the need to ensure that improvement in interface efficiency is an ongoing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, the most important change required is attitudinal adjustment. Unless interface participants adopt a positive outlook, many of the recommendations made by the Committee may prove to be ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry had a history of a cost plus approach which had little regard for the ultimate price of services. Current reforms in the stevedoring industry are changing this attitude on the waterfront. This report will help change the attitude along the entire transport chain, from shipside to landside origin or destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations are aimed at improving coordination and communication between industry participants. There is a severe lack of coordination within the sea-land transport interface. The most common symptom of this has been truck queues outside container terminals. Another serious coordination problem is the mismatch of working hours between warehouses and the waterfront. Warehouses generally operate Monday to Friday, often less than office hours&mdash;in some cases considerably less than office hours&mdash;while the waterfront can operate 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. Put simply, it is a case of trying to fit a quart into a pint pot. A better match of working hours would provide a more even flow of freight to and from the wharf and a significant improvement in interface efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To improve interface coordination, the Committee has recommended that interface efficiency councils be established in Australia's major ports. The task of these councils, comprising top level industry representatives, will be to substantially improve coordination among interface participants. Implementation of the interface efficiency council policy and day-to-day activities within the port would be handled by a port liaison officer. Potential savings to Australian business from the introduction of electronic data interchange are substantial. Tradegate Australia Ltd estimates that potential savings are in the vicinity of $200m to $400m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the Committee has recommended that a working party be established to coordinate the introduction of EDI within the transport chain. This working party will include government departments and peak industry bodies. The working party will address issues such as compatibility between EDI systems, interconnection between networks and message standardisation. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation would have the responsibility for reporting the progress of the working party to Parliament in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also has made recommendations which address documentary and money trail issues. The central problem with these areas is that procedures need to be streamlined and simplified. The Committee's recommendations are aimed at achieving this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficient operation of the interface between seaports and land transport is of critical importance to Australia's international trade. The Federal Government does not have legislative power to make the changes required to improve the efficiency of the interface. State governments have some power through control of ports and land transport. However, the onus of ensuring that the efficiency of the interface improves falls very much on the users of waterfront related services. Employers and employees alike need to consider carefully their responsibilities in creating a more flexible and cooperative export environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the major improvements in waterfront performance since the inquiry began, it is important to see that the resulting benefits go to making Australian products more competitive overseas. The same goes for interface improvements. Shippers and importers will need to be vigilant to ensure that benefits do not go into the pockets of the shipping companies and port authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port pricing will be of considerable importance and there will be a temptation to push up the financial return on port assets, in effect to use port authorities as de facto tax gatherers. Ideally, the primary role of port authorities should be to facilitate trade and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry has been broad ranging and well supported by States, port authorities, industry and unions, albeit belatedly in some cases. It has been demanding of the time of Committee members. I thank them for their support, especially members of the Subcommittee. Hopefully, the work of the Committee and the contents of the report will lead to improved efficiency of the interface between seaports and land transport. The results will depend on the attitude adopted by the participants along the transport chain between the warehouse and the wharf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later this year, the Committee will conduct a seminar on industry and government responses to the report's recommendations, and then it will make a further report to Parliament during the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I thank officers of the Department of Transport and Communications for their cooperation in responding to the Committee's numerous requests for additional information. I thank Mr John Jenkins and Mr Martin Cotton for their professional assistance throughout the inquiry. I especially thank Committee staff members Mr Christopher Paterson, Mr Les Dunn and Mrs June Murphy for their work in the course of this inquiry. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow in the footsteps of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I join him in expressing appreciation for the way in which the team worked together&mdash;I appreciated being part of it&mdash;including the other members of the Committee and the staff members who played such a vital role in putting together the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt about the importance of the matters addressed in the report, keeping in mind the problems that we face as a major trading nation dependent upon trade volumes and the free exchange of trade for our prosperity, our living standards and the future job opportunities for our young people. It is appropriate that we concentrate on the tyranny of distance and our international isolation, and therefore the need for efficient transport as an absolutely vital ingredient for maximising our performance abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worthy of note that the Orani model estimates that total savings possible to the nation in the transport sector are of the order of $3.2 billion. That is an indication of just how significant this whole area really is. Yet while progress has been made&mdash;I do not think anyone could deny that&mdash;in terms of waterfront and shipping in this country, a great deal remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the attention paid to the waterfront and shipping in recent years, they are but two links in a long and complex chain. For example, the chain may well start on an isolated Australian farm and end ultimately in a shop in New York. The processes involved in transporting the original product right through to its end form may be many and varied indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Chairman has indicated, those processes often involve an incredible amount of inefficiency and lack of coordination. In fact, whatever reforms have been made, it is probably true to say that two-thirds of the job has not yet been adequately tackled and remains to be undertaken. The Committee came to the view that when trade volumes recover the incomplete nature of the reform task will probably become more evident than ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the product of a joint standing committee comprising members of different parties, the report is a good compromise but, nonetheless, a compromise. I think that ought to be kept in mind. It does highlight some very important and appropriate issues. First amongst those, as the Chairman has indicated, is the need for attitudinal change. Australia's major economic problem is probably attitudinal, as the Chairman pointed out. The attitudes that say, `I'm all right Jack', and `You leave me alone and I will leave you alone' are very prevalent in this industry, regardless of what it means for the rest of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is a sort of club environment that reigns in the interfacing area. Port authorities, freight forwarders, ship owners and operators, the stevedoring companies with whom they are often linked, the trucking companies, the Customs agents, to a lesser extent AQIS, are all the sort of group which understands the club rules. But, unfortunately, the club rules are not especially concerned with providing the sort of highly efficient transport that we must have if we are to turn Australia's economic performance around. One exporter&mdash;and this is recorded in the report on page 54&mdash;put it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a level of ignorance and disinterest. The disinterest is caused by years of frustration of being ripped-off by the shipping industry which is a `club' of ship owners, port authorities, stevedores and agents, all work to protect their patch helped by customs and unions in a six to one fight. How does the importer or exporter win?</PARA>
<PARA>It is, to a very great degree, a national priority that we listen to and respond to the concerns of our exporters for it is they who have the potential to drag this nation out of its economic mire. It is appropriate too for the report to suggest that the Commonwealth should take a lead in facilitating reform. To that end, there is a recommendation for interface efficiency councils, as outlined by the Chairman. I fully concur with the view that the Commonwealth should not shy away from taking such a leadership role. Of course, there are now many instances available to that end in other areas: the National Road Transport Council, the National Rail Freight Corporation, the talk now of a national electricity grid, and the whole education arena have seen solid examples of an attitudinal change that says the Commonwealth must be prepared to take a leadership role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that I think the Chairman appropriately touched on was the introduction of EDI. It seems that this is an area where there is a great need for leadership by the Commonwealth. I understand, in fact, that compatible systems really must be implemented both domestically and internationally, otherwise we may see that a piecemeal take-up of this technology will prove not to increase efficiency and cost reductions but to serve exactly the opposite purpose. Obviously, nobody has any interest in seeing that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems worthy of note too that competition between ports is a potential catalyst of great worth for change, if that competition can be adequately generated by reforms to our inland transport systems. Competition between far-flung ports is not pie in the sky stuff; it can and should be something that we aim for, which could have a tremendously galvanising effect on the performance of these transport linkages that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, two points flow from this, in my view. The first is that internodal operation&mdash;or the taking up of more links in the transport chain than is currently common by companies&mdash;might well see them better able to put in a better performance because they then might not be competing so much against one another but competing on a wider scale to offer  better economies and performance to importers and exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, within the constraints of labour market provisions&mdash;both those that prevail now and those that might prevail later&mdash;more flexible, lower cost and more cooperative workplaces should act as great facilitators for better performance. That sort of flexibility is undoubtedly needed. It is needed to address the sort of situation referred to by Mr Bill Bolitho in a recent article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Ships &amp; Ports</EMPHASIS> in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront is structured to work round the clock seven days a week, but in general the consignors and consignees of cargo work their facilities Monday to Friday day shift only. The waterfront is therefore forever trying to put a quart into a pint pot and this is a major cause of waterfront cost and inefficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>The commitment that is now largely emerging for there to be the capacity for enterprise agreements ought, in a genuinely cooperative way and in a legitimate way, facilitate better the building up of that greater flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concur with the Chairman's statement that all participants in this chain need to address the need for attitudinal change. This report drags the whole mess out into the open and exposes the festering sores to the sunlight. It is a most useful start. I pay tribute to the Chairman and to the rest of the Committee for their frankness, their openness and the work they have done. I think it has been a very valuable exercise. I am sure that all of them would agree with me when I say that we must not deceive ourselves, or allow anybody else to deceive themselves, that this is anything more than the beginning of what promises to be a long and arduous road. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this morning I tabled the Committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ASIO and the Archives Act</EMPHASIS>, which is the first report to be presented to the Parliament by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization. The report addresses the question referred to the Committee of how the activities of ASIO are affected by the operations of the Archives Act 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Archives Act first came into operation in 1983 and provides a right of public access to records of the Commonwealth that are more than 30 years old. It is commonly called the 30-year rule. This is subject to the right of the Government to withhold records on grounds of defence and security and a number of other grounds. Decisions to withhold material are appealable to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Government can reinforce its claim for exemption by applying a `conclusive certificate' to the record. The 30-year rule applies and has applied to ASIO and other agencies of the Commonwealth from the proclamation of the Archives Act in 1983. ASIO is exempted from the general requirement of the Archives Act relating to the transfer of the records to the Archives. It retains full control over its records, only releasing material through the Archives in response to specific requests. In the seven years of the operation of the Act, more than 1,600 ASIO files have been wholly or partially released for public access under the provisions of the Act without any security incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO and other agencies in the intelligence communities have consistently opposed the application of the 30-year rule to their records. They were supported in this position by the Royal Commissioner, Mr Justice Hope, who recommended in his 1985 report into the Australian intelligence security agencies that ASIO's operational files be excluded from the cover of the Archives Act and released only at the discretion of the Director-General of Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government did not accept the royal commission's recommendations and, in tabling the report in 1985, the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, stated the view of the Government that the provisions of the Archives Act were already adequate to protect the legitimate concerns of the intelligence community, which should continue to be subject to the 30-year rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has continued to be a difference of opinion between the intelligence community and the Government on this matter of the release of records. In each of its annual reports since 1984, ASIO has continued to seek a review of the decision that it should be bound by the 30-year rule. It was in these circumstances that the Committee was asked to undertake the present review, which has effectively been under way since May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question for the Committee was whether ASIO's activities have been adversely affected by the operations of the Archives Act. In considering this, we have been concerned with the operations of the Archives Act only to the extent necessary to answer that question, and the report is not a general review of the operations of the Archives Act. ASIO submitted that the 30-year rule was too short and that its records and those of the other intelligence agencies should be embargoed for 50 years. It submitted that a decision to withhold a record from release on security grounds should not be reviewable on appeal to the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Committee shared the concerns of ASIO about certain classes of records, it does not accept the argument that the entire ASIO archives should be closed for the 50-year period. The Committee's general finding is that ASIO records should continue to be subject to the access provisions of the Archives Act and that the open access period in respect of ASIO records should continue to be 30 years from the creation of the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of ASIO's specific concerns relates to intelligence information supplied by Australia's defence and intelligence partners. The Committee was told that these allies supply and exchange intelligence information which is of crucial importance to Australia's defence and security and that they might terminate or reduce the level and quality of their cooperation unless completely satisfied with the level of protection provided in Australia. The Committee was told that Australia's comparatively liberal document access was a cause of concern to allies and could result in a reduction or downgrading of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure the continued flow of high quality intelligence material, the Committee recommends that it should be embargoed as long as it remains under embargo in the nation supplying it. It reinforces this recommendation by proposing that, once the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has certified that a record is foreign derived, there should be no further appeal to the AAT from a decision not to release it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another specific concern of ASIO is the need to protect agents, sources, targets and methods of operation of the organisation. It is difficult to see how an intelligence agency could function if it were not able to guarantee anonymity to its operatives. The Committee recommends that the identity of sources, agents and operatives be guaranteed in guidelines for a period of 30 years from the person's death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Committee did not accept, and does not accept, an argument of ASIO that it should be able to claim an exemption on behalf of individuals mentioned in ASIO records on broad grounds of privacy unrelated to security. The Committee was satisfied that the privacy rights of individuals were adequately protected under the general provisions of the Archives Act as administered by the Australian Archives. Nor did the Committee accept the submission of ASIO that the right of appeal to the AAT from a refusal to release ASIO records should be abolished. ASIO has proposed that an appeal to the Inspector-General should be substituted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee makes three recommendations regarding the appeal process. Firstly, it recommends that the Director-General of Security, not the Director-General of Archives, should determine applications for internal review which involve national security records. We have also concluded that there should be a further right of appeal from the Director-General of Security, through the Inspector-General of Intelligence Security, to the Attorney-General. Finally, an appeal to the AAT should lie from the decision of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For their part, the clients of the Archives wishing to access ASIO records have expressed deep frustration, both as to the failure of ASIO to comply with requests for access within the statutory 90-day period and as to a perceived failure of the organisation to be cooperative in dealing with its client group. This evidence was strongly in favour of ASIO remaining subject to the 30-year rule and highly critical of the manner in which ASIO has responded to its legal obligations to provide access to its records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO has been compared unfavourably with other Commonwealth agencies with whom these scholars deal for access to defence and security records. A problem here is that there is no identifiable person at ASIO with whom scholars can meet to negotiate complicated requests for information. Other Commonwealth agencies, such as the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, employ a designated official qualified to negotiate for the Department and to assist clients to formulate their requests. ASIO does not provide scholars with finding aids and indices, as these departments do, with the result that scholars are forced to trawl by making omnibus requests in the hope of turning up information that they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO releases records only after they have undergone a painstaking and labour intensive security by clearers who are senior intelligence officers on a routine posting. The records released, as a result of this process, frequently disappoint the expectations of the clients who complain they have been culled to such an extent that the only material released is documents already in the public domain. The Committee believes there is room for improvement in the way ASIO handles requests. The Government must appropriate sufficient resources to enable ASIO to discharge its statutory obligations. There is also a need for a change in ethos on the part of ASIO to a more cooperative approach. We recommend that an archival unit be established within ASIO to consult and negotiate with researchers, particularly those with large requests. Less complicated requests should be fast tracked. The unit needs to be accessible to the public and this means that it needs to be headed by a person who can be known to the public. This would require a change to the ASIO Act which currently requires anonymity of all ASIO personnel other than the Director-General. The unit should also develop indices and finding aids that can be made available to the public without infringing national security and should also devote some resources to preparing records in advance for release as they fall in the open access period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been expressions of concern that individuals have no right of access to records to ensure that the information about them on ASIO files is accurate. In certain cases the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act provide such rights in relation to current records but not to ASIO, as that legislation does not apply to the intelligence agencies. Such agencies routinely refuse to confirm or deny whether they have individuals under surveillance or hold records on them. The Committee recommends a means, within the 30-year period, whereby a person may bring a complaint or information to the attention of the Inspector-General of Security Intelligence which he in turn would then bring to the attention of any intelligence agency to whom it might be relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the adoption of its recommendations would ensure that the security interests of the Commonwealth continue to receive proper protection, at the same time ensuring that important national records are preserved for posterity, while providing a right of public access to those records commensurate with the requirements of the national security. We seek the support of the Parliament for their adoption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I place on record my thanks to my colleagues on the Committee and to those who contributed to the inquiry, for the time and effort they put in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization has just said, that it is a unanimous report. It was not easy for honourable members from both sides of the Parliament to reach that status, especially for the members of the Government, given that all four members on the ASIO Committee from the Government belong to the left wing faction. Similarly, it was difficult for me and my colleague Senator Austin Lewis. There was a great deal of compromise undertaken on that Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it has worked harmoniously, there are a number of matters that are beginning to concern me regarding the behaviour of members of that Committee. I quote from a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> report of 7 March 1992 by journalist Bernard Lagan. This report dealt with the appointment of the new ASIO Director-General. It was very much along the lines that the new Director-General was from outside the defence intelligence community club and he was, therefore, something of a breath of fresh air. To quote from the article, which particularly concerns me:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A counter-offensive came from some influential ALP backbenchers who became concerned that the minister responsible for ASIO, the Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, would depart even further from ALP traditions and promote a long-serving ASIO officer, its deputy director-general, to the top.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MPs met Mr Duffy this week and he acknowledged the job had been offered to the career intelligence officer, but he had turned it down.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is unwarranted and improper behaviour by any member of the Committee or anybody associated with members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee system of the House of Representatives has responsibility to the agencies and other bodies which it seeks to oversee. The committee system is not a medieval Star Chamber, it is not a court, and, importantly, the committee system is not just another outlet for the political party system. Committees work effectively not only when they act within the terms of their charter but also when they earn the respect and confidence of the bodies they are designated to investigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best committees are those which build a reciprocal bond of trust and confidence with the Public Service or other communities they deal with. That is, the best committees are those which balance basic commonsense with their specific mission statement. This requires a degree of political maturity on the part of members of the respective committees. But once this bond is broken and the committee is running an agenda which is not above board and which will serve to betray confidences, you can wave farewell to the parliamentary committee system. Once the agency or organisation the committee seeks to inquire into senses that members of the committee are pursuing objectives beyond their defined terms of reference, whatever credibility the committee system was thought to possess is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, it is incumbent upon members to appreciate the sensitivities of the Organisation. ASIO is not just another statutory body delivering a service of sorts, it is the nation's key intelligence arm. The Committee has to appreciate this. It requires a little commonsense. This does not require compromising the Committee's objectives in respect of accountability and oversight. Far from it&mdash;in fact, it enhances it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASIO would be more inclined to take the Committee into its confidences, to talk more openly and freely, and to illuminate more its concerns and activities if it knew its confidences were not going to be betrayed, and if it knew materials, transcripts and second-hand reconstructions of private conversations were not going to be regurgitated around the Parliament and in the media. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Bill 1992. This Bill addresses another of the Government's unforeseen consequences. This is a problem which will disadvantage hundreds of pathology patients, particularly those living in rural areas, those in Western Australia, for example, because of a last minute change to the legislation which was rushed through Federal Parliament earlier on in the sessions of the last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1 February changes, which I refer to, do not allow public sector collection centres to become licensed. Collection centres are places where urine and blood samples are collected. At the same time it restricts Medicare rebates for pathology services to tests on samples collected at those centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, what it means is that public hospital practices that retain the right to continue their private practices, which are very important in terms of providing these services to a number of rural towns and rural areas in particular, have missed out all round. This means that those patients in those towns will either bear the loss of having no Medicare rebate or be forced to travel many extra kilometres to have their blood or urine samples taken at licensed centres. In rural areas that might mean many extra kilometres of travelling and, since those isolated areas are already disadvantaged, the Government should have been seeking to improve access&mdash;not to make it worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the mess which the Government has allowed to develop means that there are problems not only for the patients there but also for those practices. They retain the right of private practice and some of their income, which makes the hospitals which they service viable, comes from that private practice of pathology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems. For example, patients at Warley Bush Nursing Hospital at Cowes on Phillip Island have to travel for half an hour or so to get their specimens taken. The situation is very similar at places like Inverloch and Mirboo North. It also affects some metropolitan areas. Caulfield Medical Centre has already closed two of its collection centres. Patients have to go elsewhere. It is obviously an error, and our information from the Department is that it actually had no plans to introduce this; it was just something which seemed to sort of happen. That statement, of course, is brought into question when one looks at what Senator Tate said when he was rushing the legislation through the Senate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intent is to restrict eligibility for collection centre licences to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems firm enough. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the public sector is allowed to establish collection centres Medicare benefits will be payable for specimens&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>thank goodness, I might add&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">collected in those centres. This will result in the public sector being reimbursed for services for which Commonwealth funding is already provided by hospital funding grants.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely and basically wrong. The funding grants go nowhere near paying for the costs of running pathology practices. Without the extra financing available from Medicare rebates in the private sector, many of those public hospital practices would not be viable and funding grants would need to be increased significantly. What the Government has done to the right of private practice in the pathology area is a major blow and, although the number of practices involved is not great, it is significant in terms of the impact upon the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia is rightly indignant that this amendment was never discussed with it or with its representatives on the Pathology Advisory Committee. It is a sad indictment of the supposed detailed research and consultation and it does not bode at all well for the presumptions on which the rest of the pathology restructuring was based. Indeed, it raises some questions about the anticipated savings from those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should have taken immediate action when this was drawn to its attention. It has not, and therefore we are introducing this private member's Bill, which will fix the particular problem. This will enable public hospital based practices to open or to license collection centres so that patients in those towns will be able to get Medicare rebates on their pathology samples. Quite clearly, that is something which is entirely appropriate. Quite clearly, it is something which this Government does not have any mind to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say with some sadness that it is very typical of what is happening in terms of the Health Department at present. I think it is very fair to say that morale in the Health Department is at its lowest ebb for many years; and that runs down from the top. My information is that since the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) had that humiliating defeat over his co-payments problem, since he was rolled over that&mdash;and honourable members will remember that he said that it was vital to have co-payments and that Medicare was unsustainable without the co-payments&mdash;he has basically become disinterested in the health arena. I think that everybody in this House has heard the rumours that he will either move from Health or be moved from Health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth he will not correct a glaring error like this when it would be so easy to fix, as we have demonstrated with this piece of legislation, this private member's Bill, is beyond us. Clearly, this disinterest&mdash;uninterest, if you like&mdash;that he is showing in the health arena is running down through the Department and there is no motivation to fix these sorts of problems, which are disadvantaging many patients in Australia, in particular patients in various rural areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to continue my remarks of 19 December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion that I moved and that was seconded by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on 19 December is, of course, a reality today. But I would like to reiterate that the motion nominated 2 April 1992 as National Wool Day; called upon members and parliamentary leaders to present appropriate speeches to the Parliament during private members' business and after Question Time; and called for agreement to form a committee of four members, including the honourable members for O'Connor and Stirling, to publicise this day and arrange displays in the Great Hall and a social function in the Members Hall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also called upon the wool industry, manufacturers, retailers, inventors, researchers, State governments&mdash;especially State education departments&mdash;and local government to give this day appropriate recognition, and called upon the Government to consider the issue of an appropriate postage stamp if time permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, every one of those resolutions has been achieved, with the exception of the appropriate stamp. That was not the fault of the Government; it was not the fault of Australia Post&mdash;the time scale was just too short. But I might add that Australia Post and the Australian Mint have been extremely cooperative, Australia Post in providing us with displays of the stamps of the past that have recognised the wool industry and the Mint in giving us a number of coins for presentation to important people here today&mdash;displays associated with the ram's head and the special 50c piece that was put out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we stand, just weeks after the original resolution, having achieved our objectives. The Australian Parliament, furthermore, has achieved it in a highly bipartisan fashion and at no point in time was there disagreement within the committee. In that regard, I would consequently thank the honourable member for Stirling. I would also thank the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Scott) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody has worked together on this, including the parliamentary staff at every level, and everybody has done something positive. We have just witnessed the opening. I thank the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for a very positive contribution, and the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), for his efforts. All the way round, this Parliament is demonstrating today what we can do for the nation when we get together. I am delighted; I think it is excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;this may be not of as much concern to you as it is to the Speaker later in the day&mdash;that I have promised that, while honourable members keep talking about wool, I will not take a point of order. So that might calm the day down a little. That is the level of my commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have at this very moment in the national Parliament a fully fledged commercial wool auction going on, and people are bidding good prices. Let us hope that at the end of the day that auction has lifted the price indicator so that people know how things are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention a number of people who are doing things outside this Parliament. In my State, the Country Women's Association has taken over Forrest Place and is doing a wonderful display. In Duranillin, Woolshed Industries is doing a display, as are the Doonunder people in Bolgart. In the wheat-belt, places like Koorda, with the help of Merle Henny, are getting on with it. I have got to say, if one can bring a little bit of politics into it, that even the Geraldton branch of the Liberal Party is having a special day for wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving my State of Western Australia, I mention that the people involved with the tourist attraction called the Big Woolbales at Hamilton in Victoria are doing their bit. The people who took on one of the great tasks down there of actually manufacturing a product from wool, Ultrafine Merino Gold Jumpers and John O'Sullivan, have put on a special display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in my State, other people who are doing their bit are the Storm Boy people, Noel and May Klopper of Boyup Brook just outside my electorate, and Stonehaven Craft Industries at Arthur River. The Wool Foundation in Tambellup has already created a wool bale which will have value added advantages because when one creates scoured wool, the people who are buying that want it in the pack that will least contaminate it. Of course, wool cannot contaminate itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they are some of the people who have been involved in providing goods to us today to put on display. There are other people who will be mentioned as individuals. I want now to mention particular organisations. The CSIRO has been magnificent in its support. The Australian Wool Corporation is the coordinator and the principal financier of what we see in the Great Hall today. I think the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and the other speakers from the Committee will all agree that we could not have possibly done it without the help of the people from the AWC. They have risen to the occasion. I am sure they are reaping the rewards for the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental purpose of what we have done today is to focus the Parliament and the mind of its honourable members on the wool industry. We have seen that happen today because I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy included in his speech a commitment to a task force. It happens this way, as we well know. I hope that before the day is out we might even have something from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that today the Australian Parliament is thinking about wool. The Australian people are thinking about wool. We hit the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show with publicity and that is good, because the wool industry deserves publicity. There has been a great reaction from the media to the magnificent display and unique auction in the Great Hall. As I said, I am sure that at the end of the day the price indicator will have risen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament has done something positive in a period when the negative seems to apply, when everybody is down in the dumps. We are talking about an industry that over the last 25 years has topped our exports on eight occasions. I think it was second on another seven occasions, and it has never been less than fourth in that 25-year period. It is a great industry, full of great people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the display today we can see wonderful examples of cottage industry, with people doing things to value add wool, something which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has expressed as being a target which he intends to achieve. People are doing it, not in a big way, not in huge factories, but all around Australia in smaller factories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others who have helped us include Boral Cyclone, a very large Australian company, along with Town and Country Hire services here in Canberra, the farmers and others whom I am sure the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) will also mention. These people were only asked once and they came out with all the things we needed to put this particular display together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give a special mention to Simon Dickie who undertook the task of designing and orchestrating the display for the Australian Wool Commission. What is more, I understand that he is working without remuneration. Again, that is evidence of how, when asked, people will give wool a hand. They all say yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I make a plea to the Australian people to do their country and themselves a favour. With winter approaching they should buy some good wool products. They are not expensive any more. I am wearing a tie that was provided by the Wool Corporation, but all the others I wear cost me less than $20. Wool doonas are no more expensive than feather doonas, but they will last a lot longer. They are an Australian product and that is why I am asking people to give by buying, and to help themselves in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If everybody bought two pairs of the red socks that I hope we are all wearing today, we would put a huge dent in their stockpile. All we need is for Australians to buy wool, but as a result of today we will see the wool industry publicised around Australia. I thank the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Truss)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I take it that the leave granted by the House earlier was for the honourable member for O'Connor to speak again to the motion without closing the debate on the motion which he had previously moved. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). I am delighted to join the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in his initiative. It was a great idea that he had. As is often the case, it was a very simple idea that turned out to be a great idea. I want to compliment him on that. The first time I heard about it, it made sense to me. As he has just expressed, it is a day that has really resulted in some significant events in terms of this Parliament and, we hope, in terms of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the honourable member for O'Connor struck upon a very good idea because he could see that we needed to have a National Wool Day which supported a very significant industry. I know that the people in the gallery would understand just how important this industry is to Australia. I would like to particularly thank one of the staff members of the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Norm Haywood; Ruth Webber from my staff, who has been working very hard; and Kylie Croxford and Margaret Fisher, who have done exceptionally good work on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank my colleagues on the National Wool Day Committee, the honourable member for O'Connor, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who have done a great job. I would also like to acknowledge the support for this initiative from the Speaker and the President. I thank them for their support of what is a very significant day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In joining this motion might I say, as Chairman of the Selection Committee, that this is the largest number of speakers we have ever had on a private member's motion. This is indicative of just how important this industry is as far as this Parliament is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge our friends in the Australian Workers Union and our friends in front of Parliament House who are unemployed shearers. I would like to point out that today we are talking about supporting Australian wool and the Australian wool industry. I would like to think that the Australian wool industry would support Australian shearers and ensure that they are given a fair go and that they are given an opportunity to get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people I have dealt with here today, in front of Parliament House, are exceptionally good, hardworking people; and we will have achieved something if today we can ensure that such people are back in full time work in the industry. I think it is a very important and exceptionally significant issue and we must have that happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the following organisations: the Australian Wool Corporation, which has done an exceptionally good job&mdash;it has taken the ball and run with it; and the CSIRO, which brings to this exhibition an example of its high level of research and the high skill of its personnel, for which it deserves every credit. I would also thank Simon Dickie, as the honourable member for O'Connor has mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to include the management of CSIRO; the Australian Mint, which is supporting the day with its 50c coins stamped with the ram's head; and Australia Post. I particularly thank the parliamentary departments. I think the Joint House Department has done an exceptionally good job and has really gone out of its way. As Gary Van Egmond said to me last night, he has never dealt with people who are so professional, so cooperative, so genuinely supportive of this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Parliament, who have gone about this in the right spirit. This is not a partisan day; this is a bipartisan day. It is a special day. I would like to think that all our colleagues and staff of the Parliament will see it in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">June Ey and her team from the Joint House Department have been quite outstanding. I thank also the staff at the Parliamentary Book Shop, who have really gone out of their way to put on sale woollen products. My thanks also go to John Brudenall and the team at the Parliamentary Library, and I suggest that people have a look at the exhibition in the Parliamentary Library. There are some remarkable books there that go back 100 years. As the honourable member for O'Connor well remarked, this is an industry with great stature in Australia, and that exhibition shows the quality of the contribution of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the following people: tour guides, Barry Jackson and his team; the security officials, who have been very helpful; Melissa Moore and her helpers in the Parliamentary Catering Service, who provided a farmers breakfast today. I do not think the honourable member for O'Connor and I have had time for breakfast today, but there was a breakfast provided in Parliament House if we needed it. I thank the gardeners, who have also assisted. I thank Peter West from the Government Photographic Service, and I remind all members that he will take photographs in the Great Hall today of this great event. I also thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, Phil Bergin, and his staff; and the Usher of the Black Rod, Rob Alison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also thank ACT Ministers Connolly and Wood for their assistance. We needed their approval to conduct an auction because this Parliament is actually covered by ACT law and, in fact, does not have specific laws to deal with the matter. Mr Connolly and Mr Wood were very positive. They responded in the best possible way and said that we did not need to get an auctioneers licence because they considered this a one-off event and the auctioneers were not going to be here on a full time basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the sensible and cooperative approach of such people that has been remarkable. I think the honourable member for O'Connor has said it very eloquently. We found that, once we got the idea going, it was a question of saying, `Come and join us', and everyone has been trying to do that. The honourable member for O'Connor's electorate, in particular, has in it a remarkable number of people who have shown an interest in the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bindi Bindi is where these sheep broaches come from. It is a fantastic little product that everyone is asking us about. We should have brought more over, in fact. Everyone is asking us for those. But there are badges being given out today and we are finding that there is a whole lot of support in the community for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A special mention should go to Jim McPherson and Peter Austin, from the Australian Wool Corporation, who really have gone out of their way to make sure this day works. I thank my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa, who has put in a great effort&mdash;I can just seem him there over the wool pile&mdash;and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has been very active and very supportive locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to encourage everyone to visit the displays and the activities because today we have not only the auction in the Great Hall and the Press Club luncheon address by Mr Mac Drysdale, but also a seminar being chaired by the great John Landy&mdash;in some senses one of those very quintessential Australian institutions in the way that the wool industry is. I would like to think that people would attend that seminar this afternoon at 4.00. There is also a function on this evening. So I think that this is an opportunity for this Parliament to feel very special about a special industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have to ask is: where do we go from next year? I would like to think that we have achieved two goals. First, we have given international recognition to this industry. This is where Paddy McGuinness in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> has got it wrong. Quite honestly, it is the most narrow carping nonsense I have read on the subject of what is happening. He says that the aim of the day is only to promote the domestic market. I would like to inform Mr McGuinness that today in Japan it has been declared Wool Day. In Osaka all the buyers have gathered together and declared it Wool Day. The television feed from the Great Hall is in fact going to Tokyo and to London. If that is not international, I do not know what is. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Embassies and trade commissioners will be coming along this evening. They are in there in the hall now. The problem for Paddy McGuinness is that he ought to mix in the real world like we do here, and mix with some real people. He would then understand that this is a business going places, backed by us, backed by the Parliament and backed by the Wool Corporation. I would also like to ask him whether he can find any parliament in the world that would seek out an industry and invite it to have a special event in the parliament. Of course he could not, because he exists in that closeted thinking that holds people back. I think it is absolutely barren thinking, quite frankly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For once we have got everyone working together. People out there say to us that they want parliamentarians to get together and work together. We are doing it. So for goodness sake, Mr McGuinness, try to get in tune with us. We are all working together on this and we would ask you to respond to the tempo and talk to your colleagues in the media, who are equally as enthusiastic as we are. That is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the two things have been evident: international recognition and domestic recognition. We have all gone out of our way to make it a special day and I thank my colleagues. Quite frankly, they have been terrific. We have worked hard at this. We have tried to make sure that everyone is involved on an absolutely bipartisan basis, and it has worked. It has worked properly and no-one could say that we could have achieved any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To our friends and visitors to Australia, this is a very important industry. We want you to understand that it is an important industry. We are behind it and the community of Australia is behind it. I conclude by saying that if out of this we can get greater enthusiasm, better prices, more employment for Australians, shearers and other people in the industry, we will have achieved much. Obviously, I am pleased to support this very good motion of the honourable member for O'Connor and I thank all colleagues in the Parliament for their support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The celebration of National Wool Day in the Parliament of Australia is an unprecedented event, as it is an unprecedented event anywhere in the world. Credit must be given to all political parties, as they have taken a bipartisan approach to the proceedings of this day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further acknowledgment, of course, must be paid to the Australian Wool Corporation for the great role it has played and for the support that we have received from the board of the Corporation and, of course, its recently elected chairman, Mac Drysdale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me, at this stage, not to acknowledge the merino ram display which is greeting visitors on the front lawns of Parliament House. I guess last night I went to bed worried whether those sprinklers really had been turned off, but the cooperation I received to ensure that they were turned off was appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My most sincere thanks go to Wally Merriman, from the Merrivale stud at Yass, who has brought rams here today; Mr and Mrs David Milthorpe, who have come all the way from the Riverina with their sheep; and also to Mrs Winston McDonald, who has come from not far out of Canberra to arrange this exhibition today. Further appreciation is extended to the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders for its cooperation in this event. Of course, it is the Australian stud merino breeder who is the first link in the great wool chain. Without the genetic improvement of our Australian flock, we could never see such a great product as we have in Australia today. I also acknowledge the fact that we have the President of the Australian Association here in Parliament today, Mr Stewart Beveridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament is further honoured today with the presence of Mr Don Vanrenen, who is the President of the Federation of World Merino Breeders. The international wool industry owes Mr Vanrenen a debt of great magnitude for his many years of dedication to the trade. I am very pleased to see Mr Vanrenen here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian merino has no peer. The Australian merino stud breeder is not only a custodian of the Australian wool industry, but stud master to the world. Australian merino rams are purchased by wool producing countries throughout the world. For over 150 years Australians have had a free ride on the sheep's back. Today, it is the turn of each and every Australian to salute this great pioneering industry. Today, let us reverse the cliche and put the wool fleece on the back of all Australians, and perhaps reverse some of the burdens that it still has to come to grips with in the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time available to me this morning, I would like to focus the Parliament's attention on the future prospects for the Australian wool industry. However, before contemplating the future, I would like just to touch on the past. The further that we can look back, the greater capacity we have to look ahead. It was in 1797 that the first flock of Spanish merino sheep landed on Australian shores. These sheep became part of the foundation of the Samuel Marsden and Captain John Macarthur flocks. In fact, the strains of the original Macarthur flocks still exist at Camden Park in New South Wales today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout wool industry history, Australia has been fortunate in attracting men and women of high calibre, skill and dedication. I would like to pay tribute to some of these people. The names that come to mind are people such as Sir William Vines, Sir William Gun, Mr Alf Mandin and Mr David Asimus. All had a major contribution to make to the future of this great industry and the direction it took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These men made enormous personal contributions and sacrifices to the Australian wool industry. They were leaders with a global perspective, prepared to take the necessary decisions to ensure that the great Australian wool industry remained the undisputed source with the finest wool in the world&mdash;not only the finest wool, but the least contaminated wool in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wool industry stands as an example to other domestic industries of how efficiency and quality can be produced without tariff protection. It is a pity that the foresight attributed to the wool industry was not inherited by the history of our manufacturing industries. Australia produces the finest wool in the world, in one of the world's harshest environments. Wool produced on the world's driest continent on earth is worn by the fashion conscious across the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting statistic that the average merino ram produces 33 kilometres of wool per day. If you work out how much it produces in its entire lifetime, which is approximately seven years, it is enough to have a single yarn going from Sydney to London five times over&mdash;such are the productive gains that have been made by the Australian merino since they first arrived on Australian shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very progressive nature of the wool industry demands that representatives aspire to bigger and better things. In the course of history, the wool selling methods have been transformed beyond recognition. The wool auction in the Great Hall today really gives honourable members two examples of how wool was sold. There was the traditional method of selling  for single lots, and the sale by description method&mdash;the traditional method which is used today. No longer is it necessary for the entire wool clip to be inspected prior to sale. Today wool can be sold to buyers across the world by description&mdash;the auction in the Great Hall is testimony to that. Such advances pave the way for the possibility of wool sales direct from the farm gate. In such circumstances, the woolgrower would be able to sell to international buyers from the confines of his or her property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the qualities of the Australian wool clip, including micron, yield, colour, length and strength can be scientifically measured. However, like any quality, naturally occurring product, there are many subjective characteristics that defy measurement. If this were not the case, wool could be produced synthetically. I believe it will always remain the case that there are some unique characteristics to wool, and that it will never ever be produced scientifically or synthetically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the House to an analogy between wine and wool. The producer of a fine wine must consider many variable factors in climate, soil configuration, the year, grape varieties and the expertise of the grower. The final product, however, will be determined by including all these factors. A fine wine will come together only with the right ingredient mix. The same can be said for quality merino wool. An accredited wool classer&mdash;or indeed, wine taster&mdash;cannot assume responsibility for the quality of the end product. Such quality, in the case of wool, is determined at the early stage, taking into consideration breeding, environmental conditions, the expertise of the sheep classer, and other such variable factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to progress confidently down the path of sale by total description only, I believe the wool industry must take into consideration the genetic make-up of the merino. We have very clear genetic make-ups in our Australian flock today, and one of the many strengths of the Australian merino flock is that relatively few breeders have influenced the genetic make-up of the Australian parent studs. They fall into four groups&mdash;Peppin, South Australian, Saxon and Spanish. Some of those studs have not had any outside genetic influence for more than 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is an important characteristic that cannot be measured, but should be identified. In recognition of this factor, the industry should accredit the sheep classer, not only the wool classer in the shearing shed, as is the case today. By accrediting the sheep classer, sale by description should include the genetic type of the flock. Like a fine wine, quality merino wool should be able to be sold by reputation&mdash;with the expertise of the sheep classer and the wool classer being taken into consideration. I believe that today is a unique day, and I hope there continues in the future to be a day when the Parliament will recognise this great Australian industry. It is world-class by any standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would like to signal to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that in the August Budget he should consider offsetting any increase in the woolgrower tax by an increase in the funds needed by the industry to promote wool in 1992-93. Approximately $27m is required to increase promotion in the coming 12 months, and I believe it would be money well spent. I hope that the Government in its August Budget puts its money where its mouth is, and supports this great Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to congratulate the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards). I think that the initiative of the honourable member for O'Connor in proposing a national wool day during private members' business should be congratulated. I also know how much effort the honourable member for Stirling has put into it. In the end though, unless we address the underlying problems of the industry, it will avail us little&mdash;to make ourselves happy for a day, to think we have achieved something significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry is, without a doubt, the greatest decentralised industry in Australia. In a sense it is the most important industry: it employs people over a very wide geographical area of the country and is the only industry that provides any employment in certain areas of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to be talking on this Bill because it gives me an opportunity to talk about a subject dear to my heart&mdash;sectoral support for industry. One of the problems we have in Australia is that no government in Australia has ever asked what sort of industry this country needs. If we ask ourselves the question, the answer becomes self-evident. Clearly, we need the great rural industries and the mining industry. But these industries themselves are not enough. We need to be value adding in what we produce and we need to be adding a manufacturing industry to service them. This is a subject which I shall be taking up in greater length at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to have a wool industry, it must be an industry that benefits the whole of Australia. I am appalled by the short-sighted attitude adopted by some people in the industry who, for reasons best known to themselves&mdash;one can only put it down to greed&mdash;have decided to supply employment to fly-by-night tourists from New Zealand who are coming over here and undercutting established awards and breaking down conditions in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to pastoralists who are very concerned about this. Some I spoke to in the Hamilton area said that they had never had a more successful shearing than they had last year and they would not countenance using these people, because they saw it as only a short term expedient. They said that the real danger was that, just when they were making big strides towards revamping the award, getting rid of some of the factors in it which were obviously outdated, and there was very good rapport between shearers&mdash;the unions&mdash;and them as the employers, the progress would all be thrown out of the window for the short term greed of a few individuals. It is sad to see the agro-political bodies that purport to represent farmers encouraging this influx of New Zealand shearers, who are not paying any tax in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most vehement criticism I have had in my electorate is from New Zealand shearers who have come to Australia and made a commitment to this great country. They have said, `We have come over here; we have made a commitment. We pay our taxes. Now we are being forced out of work by these people, who are operating quite unfairly'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a couple of other things about the wool industry. It will avail us nothing here today if our good words are just so much hot air. There are real problems in the industry. The most pressing problem of all is the wool tax presently saddled upon the wool producers. Figures I have seen indicate</PARA>
<PARA>that, for a pure wool producer with 12,000 sheep, the imposition of every one per cent of wool tax is equivalent to the imposition of 8 per cent of income tax. This is because the wool tax is paid on the gross revenue of that wool producer. It is very onerous and, in my view, it is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the present price of wool, given that the Wool Realisation Commission is forced to sell the assets of the old Wool Corporation&mdash;assets which should be sold&mdash;there is no need for a tax at all to fund the industry. Suppose, however, that a 2 per cent margin is added to the 3 per cent for research and development and for promotion. That percentage is more than adequate and any attempt by the bureaucracy of the wool industry to raise that should be very strongly resisted. The wool industry can service the stockpile on that 5 per cent wool tax very comfortably. I believe we should be taking steps to reduce the wool tax to as little as possible; certainly 5 per cent is a figure that, in my view, would service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about wool promotion. At a recent meeting of woolgrowers in Perth, the American consulate official that deals here with trade matters was asked why the United States, which is potentially the biggest wool consuming area in the world, was not in fact using much wool. He said, `You really can't sell wool suits in America, because people associate them with those rough, wool serge suits that we had during the Korean War as Army uniforms'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought to myself that, given the enormous amount of money that has been spent on wool promotion, this really is an indictment of our efforts. I find it mind-boggling that, after all the money and all the time that has been spent, this is still the case in the United States. Clearly, the United States, with its large per capita income, and a lot of it with a very cool climate, is an area where wool should be doing well. The fact that it is not is something that needs close investigation. I would suggest that just throwing more money at the problem will not solve it, just as I might add on the side that throwing more money at the Aboriginal problem will not solve that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People ask me about the future for wool. There is clearly a future. If one looks at the long term price of wool, one sees that the long term trend line of the Wool Board's 22-micron indicator is around 695c. History shows that in any 10-year period wool will cycle through this line 2 1/2 times. People who have been in the wool industry should understand this; the banks that one would hope would be supporting the wool industry should understand this; the Government that is fearful of being left with a stockpile should understand this; and certainly people in the Wool Corporation should understand it. As the price of wool gets higher than that, people will start to move into other fibres, into substitution, the price will come back and that cycle will be repeated. In this country we ought to be looking to support the wool industry in every way we can. We ought to have in place every facility to assist growers to overcome these disabilities. It is my view that this assistance should be in such market mechanisms as futures, contractual pricing&mdash;in fact, any mechanism at all that will help to smooth out that path to give a more predictable income to growers. Certainly the mechanisms are there. All we need is the will to enforce them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say something about other uses for wool. I was recently at the Kangaroo 92 exercises. One of the complaints coming from reservists who were on service in those exercises was that their uniforms were very hot. I am pleased to say that the Army is looking at this quickly. I am sure the Army will resolve it and will get for our soldiers the best possible uniform. I doubt whether wool will be considered but a wool-cotton mixture, in my view, could be the very best type uniform for tropical climates. I have lived myself in these areas; my electorate takes in a lot of them. I have found wool one of the more comfortable fibres to wear in that environment. I am hoping that we can look at a wool blend in Army uniforms. Certainly I think it should be considered in Australian Army uniforms. If we produce a uniform that is even marginally better than anything else that exists, we open up potential for sales of that material to other people with a similar demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem that concerns me is that I have heard speakers today talk about the unique character of the Australian wool industry, yet we do not take any steps to protect ourselves. There should be imposed an immediate ban on the export of all merino genetic material. The arguments put forward against this by DPIE and by people with vested interests are quite spurious. The reality is that the world can produce merino wool equal to the Australian wool except for two characteristics. One is black fibres&mdash;the lack of black fibre in Australian wool makes it a very valuable commodity. The other one is the consistency of fibre diameter within fleece. This can vary very widely and Australia, with its genetic fortune, has wool where that variation is limited; we have a much better consistency within the fibre. The only way a foreign country can do it is to genetically manipulate the sheep for 150 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to congratulate the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on coming up with the idea of the National Wool Day. It is especially important in these difficult times for woolgrowers that Australians do not forget pioneers such as George Russell in the Geelong area and other woolgrowers around Australia who built up this remarkable industry. Geelong today is the home of the National Wool Museum and the adjacent Wool Centre right in the heart of the city. The 50,000 paying visitors attracted to the museum each year include some 7,000 tourists from overseas, and that is a testimony to the esteem in which wool is held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these visitors are able to watch Geelong's 30 to 33 wool sales that are held each year, which consume about 10 per cent of the national wool clip. This combination represents to the people of Geelong what the Stockman's Hall of Fame does to the people of Longreach in western Queensland; it is a national monument. The numbers of visitors to the National Wool Museum has steadily held over the past year. In Victoria only Puffing Billy and the Phillip Island penguins have recorded a greater improved performance as measured by the number of visitors that attend them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is critical that Australia uses the National Wool Day as a think-tank or a springboard for some ideas for the future of the wool industry. Australia has benefited greatly from world trade and would benefit more if other nations reduced the usage of tariff and non-tariff barriers. This argument has received much attention recently, both in this Parliament and in the seat of Wills. I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last year on the John Laws program, on 14 March, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australia is . . . better off without a TCF industry. . .</PARA>
<PARA>There has been a remarkable change in the Prime Minister's attitude to the current rhetoric that he indulges in here in this place. The Prime Minister's statement may be a self-fulfilling prophecy because, under Labor, protection has been selectively reduced but costs in some industries that are fed into the TCF sector have not been reduced. The waterfront is a good example. The National Farmers Federation has recently found that exporters and importers are not seeing any cost reductions flowing from the reduction in waterfront manning levels, and this has a flow-on effect to the wool industry, which is a very important exporter of its primary product. Industrial disputes on the waterfront in December 1991 ran at five times the national average so we can see that the so-called reforms on the waterfront are not helping Australia or the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry will be still at a comparative disadvantage by the year 2000 under Labor's plans, with high tariffs for the TCF industry. In that sector Australia needs to move away from the idea that we will be a clever country if we merely have long lines of employees sitting at sewing machines, protected from world competition. Under the Fightback reforms there will be an average benefit to farmers of some $8,100 per enterprise but the TCF industries will not be decimated because those which can move with the times and capitalise on advantages such as shorter lead times that give a greater responsiveness to retailers' requests will survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that many of the forward looking textile companies in my electorate&mdash;such as Classweave in North Geelong&mdash;which service niche markets in Australia can take advantage of the speed with which they can service customers such as the national retailer Target Australia Pty Ltd. Classweave currently pays 45c extra in the dollar on its base level of wages for oncosts, including training guarantee levy, holiday pay, leave loading, sick leave, Workcare and superannuation. These additional costs need to come down; that will help Classweave continue to prosper in the twenty-first century. Fightback will reduce these oncosts as we outline in the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An aggressive policy of cost reduction can be a strategy that will benefit all sectors of Australia. The Australian Manufacturing Council recently found that if the economy functioned at the best international levels and if the Government's admittedly incomplete assistance reduction program were continued, output in agriculture would rise by almost one per cent but output in all manufacturing sectors overall, excluding basic non-ferrous metals, would rise by 6.8 per cent. Even greater gains could be expected if protection of the TCF and car industries were further reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the disastrous reserve price scheme the Australian Wool Realisation Commission now has a debt of some $2.7 billion and is subject to a seven-year repayment schedule. The stockpile, I am pleased to say, has come down to a little over four million bales. The Government clearly has an obligation to woolgrowers, of which I am one&mdash;and I declare my interest&mdash;to lower the onerous 12 per cent wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition was clear in its view about this wool tax in the lead up to that particular piece of legislation. We advocated that it should be less than 10 per cent. We have been vindicated in our position on the figures and the way in which wool has moved back through the open auction system. I am sure that a wool tax of less than 10 per cent is the way to go. Many woolgrowers regard the diminishing prospect of a cash rebate, as put up in the One Nation package, being introduced as an idea of the Keating Government that would simply eat up about $2m in administrative costs, rather than taking a decision to reduce the level of the wool tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it might be appropriate to concentrate on some of the technical breakthroughs in Australian wool that the CSIRO is aiding through its Division of Wool Technology. One of its three laboratories is located in Belmont within the electorate of Corangamite. There are 230 people employed there making CSIRO one of Geelong's larger employers. The Division of Wool Technology costs approximately $26m to run, with 60 per cent of its funding coming from the Wool Research Trust Fund administered by the Wool Research and Development Corporation and 40 per cent from the budget allocations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly impressed with the way in which CSIRO has developed a fashion consciousness in the industry. Generally, it has endeavoured to focus on the retail consumer. Its actions have spoken louder than some other sections of the wool industry which have at times mouthed rhetoric but have actually been content to criticise buyers and claim that it was the customers rather than the growers who were at fault for all the difficulties in the industry. I note that the head of the CSIRO's Division of Wool Technology, Dr Ken Whiteley, who I am pleased to say spends much of his time in Geelong and is here today at our National Wool Day, has this to say about wool:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the future, fabrics made from a single fibre type will be the exception. . . a wool rich blend can overcome many of the processing and performance disadvantages of pure wool. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In that statement, of course, there is a major debate amongst woolgrowers and processors as to the role of wool. I agree with the suggestion that we need to integrate some of our product with other fibres to make it saleable and useable for the fashion industry. I am pleased that the honourable member opposite agrees with that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry has to have a single aim&mdash;to meet the demands of the customer. I am pleased to see that the demand in France for Australian wool has risen about 110 per cent over the last year, compared with the French appetite for all wools having increased by 60 per cent. Obviously, whilst there are some special factors in the stockpile, it is encouraging to see Australian wool again being in demand in the fickle European market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has CSIRO introduced sale by sample&mdash;an auction method which has saved the woolgrower millions of dollars&mdash;it has over the past few years given attention to the processing. The Siroclear optical sensor contaminant detector has been a specialty of the Belmont laboratory. It has proven particularly useful in reducing the incidence of dark fibres in white wool. All woolgrowers would be aware of the terrible impact of black wool in their woolclip on the processors and on the production of high quality garments at the end of the production chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously raised in this Parliament the necessity for wool sales to remain in Geelong. There is no rationale for abandoning sales in an internationally known and respected centre of woolgrowing excellence such as Geelong. The sample boxes could be easily exhibited on the show floors adjacent to the wool storage areas, which is a convenience for brokers and gives satisfaction to the growers who attend the wool sales. It needs to be remembered that Geelong is close to Melbourne and, in this instance, it is easier for wool buyers to travel than to cope with the logistics of transporting literally thousands of sample boxes to Melbourne. Whilst the sale by sample method of wool selling remains, there is absolutely no reason to centralise wool selling in Victoria. However, I concede that if electronic sale by description becomes a standard practice without physical samples being part of the process, the location of wool selling will be irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Stock Exchange now has in place a totally integrated national system of share trading, conducted through terminals in each stockbrokers office across Australia. This system has been running for 18 months. I predict that inevitably wool selling will be conducted in this manner with buyers all around the world having the capacity to make screen bids to an Australian auction clearing house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in supporting the motion before the House today and I would like to congratulate the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), for putting forward this motion and for working together so that we can focus, in Parliament, on our biggest export primary industry&mdash;the wool industry. I think that we can be very proud of the cooperation that has taken place, from the Speaker and the President of the Senate to our parliamentary attendants&mdash;everybody involved in promoting wool today and, in particular, the Wool Corporation, the CSIRO and all of the other individuals who have already been mentioned by the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Stirling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This indicates that, while politicians are usually seen to be disagreeing with each other, from time to time we can work together on something as fundamentally important as the promotion of our greatest export industry, our primary industry. That is good; I think it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased when the honourable member for Stirling mentioned that Landline is today taking footage of the auction in the Great Hall and of the other events and that that footage is being shown in London, in Tokyo and in Osaka. I think that is very important. Of course, it is promotion for our product, for Australian product. It is pleasing that the price of wool is moving and that, after the last two disastrous years, there is a bit more optimism around. Of course, the weather has also been much more pleasing, and I think we can be optimistic about the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important at this stage, too, to recognise the pioneers of the wool industry&mdash;not only people like Sir William Gunn but also the pioneers who go unnoticed, the men and women who over the last 200 years went to isolated areas, settled and raised sheep. Many of them sacrificed a great deal. Many people had their lives shortened. I think we should pause and pay tribute to our pioneers, particularly the pioneers in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many speakers today have covered wool marketing and blending, which I fully support. However, one thing which is important but which has not been focused on today is blending wool with other fibres like cotton, if there is a market niche there for our product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would like to focus on is a part of the industry that has not had much recognition in this debate, and certainly in the broader debate out in the Great Hall. The wool industry is not just about sheep; it is about people. It is about those men and women who are pastoralists, those people who work so hard to produce this great fleece, the best in the world. It is also about the transport industry. It is also about the shipping industry. And, importantly, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and what I want to focus on&mdash;it is about shearers. I have great admiration for shearers. It has been said that, if we all bought two pairs of woollen socks, we would reduce the stockpile. I know that you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I do. I see that honourable members at the table have red socks on today, and it is great to have bipartisanship with such a great colour and great Aussie wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we buy Australian products, and that we buy Australian woollen products. I am very proud to be associated with and to support the wool industry in its drive. But the one thing that disappoints me in this regard is that those same people are not promoting the buying of Australian labour. That is the thing that disappoints me, because this industry is about people; and at the present time our shearers are facing one of the greatest challenges of all times. It has come about because there has been an attempt to destroy award conditions in this industry and because we have a large number of New Zealand shearers coming into Australia. I do not necessarily oppose their right to come over here and to sell their labour; what I do oppose is the fact that many of them are coming over here and breaking down award conditions and health and safety conditions. It is not in the interests of pastoralists and it is not in the interests of the National Farmers Federation to allow that to happen, because we do not have a healthy industry unless we have a fair industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, what we need is cooperation; we need unity within our industry. I am disappointed that there is not enough focus on the fact that we need to buy Australian labour if we are going to have a fully united wool industry. I challenge the National Farmers Federation to come out and support Australian labour and award conditions. I am a producer, and we producers want a fair price for sugar, a fair price for tomatoes, and a fair price for wool. The least that we can do is to give a fair price for a man's labour. That can be done only through award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on that. The shearers outside have conducted themselves outstandingly during the time that they have been here. They have not disrupted events. In fact, they have a great recognition of the importance for them&mdash;and for their sons, if they wish to go into the industry&mdash;of a viable and prosperous industry if they want to have a future in it. They are supportive of the National Wool Day today, too. But I think they deserve a fair go, and they are certainly not getting it. I am pleased to see that the Government is taking up some of the points they have already raised. I know they are having meetings today, as they had yesterday, with some of the Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an attack on New Zealand. I support CER totally and I believe that we need to be able to travel from one side of the Tasman to the other. But I believe it to be important that, if people come to this country to sell their labour, they sell it under award conditions and they stick to award conditions. I challenge the National Farmers Federation to come out and support `buy Australian' labour. All the shearers buy Australian wool and all the workers in this country buy Australian products. Surely to goodness, all the woolgrowers should buy Australian labour first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left, I would like to mention again the importance of the wool industry&mdash;as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said&mdash;in helping to decentralise this nation.

It is ironical that 100 years ago, under an old gnarled tree at Barcaldine, it was shearers who wanted a fair go&mdash;all that the shearers here today want is a fair go, too&mdash;and decided to form their own political movement so that they would get a fair go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a fourth generation woolgrower myself, I am particularly proud of it and particularly proud of the wool industry itself. My forebears settled just north of Clare in South Australia in 1841 and built up a very famous property, known as Bungaree. It is famous not only for its wool but also for its sheep; its rams, which have been sold all over  Australia and are noted as big, strong, heavy-cutting South Australian merinos. Today my cousins still run that property. That in itself is quite historic: after 150 years, the property is still in the same family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to now represent one of the great woolgrowing electorates in Australia, the electorate of Wannon. Wannon produces some of the best wool in Australia and Wannon can boast not only the wool capital of Australia but the wool capital of the world in Hamilton.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come back to that and give some more reasons as to why Hamilton has earned that title but, first of all, I want to talk briefly about the significance of the wool industry, something that has made Australia the great country it is today. If one looks back through our history, one will find references to the wool industry and its significance from the very beginning. Samuel Sidney wrote in his book the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Three Colonies of Australia</EMPHASIS>, first published in 1852, that `wool made Australia a solvent nation, and, in the end, a free one'. In other words, it was the wool industry that took us that big step from being a penal colony to being a free nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows the sheep numbers in Australia every year since 1901. It shows that since 1901 our sheep numbers have roughly doubled from 71 million to the current number of about 170 million. But it also shows that not only have we more than doubled our sheep numbers but also the productivity has gone up dramatically. If we look at our sheep numbers as a percentage of the world's&mdash;say, back in 1911, the earliest date I have for these figures&mdash;we find that Australia had 13.6 per cent of the world's sheep but produced 26.5 per cent of the world's wool. In other words, our production was proportionately double our sheep numbers. We find that in the most recent figures I have here, for 1986, that proportion is still the same. In other words, since 1901 the sheep numbers have more than doubled but the production of wool has gone up more than fourfold. That in itself is a remarkable achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it has not always been plain sailing and we have had some very strong debates in this chamber in recent times about some of the current difficulties facing the wool industry, but that is nothing new. The fact is that the industry has survived and prospered. In the 1840s, for example, there was a drought and a world economic depression which led to the collapse of the wool markets in the 1840s. A sheep that had cost $2.25 in those days could not be sold for 5c. It all has a rather familiar ring about it, does it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is still a very major wool producer, in fact, the most important exporter. We produce 29 per cent of the world's wool. We produce 41 per cent of the world's apparel wool&mdash;that is, the quality wool&mdash;but we produce 70 per cent of the world's traded apparel wool. So we dominate the market, have done so for many years and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about wool, sometimes it is important to get back to the basics and see why this natural fibre, this fibre that comes from agricultural sustainable development, if you like&mdash;recycled development in many cases and a product that can be recycled&mdash;is such a significant fibre. Why has it been the premier fibre for all these years? I will quickly run through some of its qualities and honourable members will see that it is unique and it is in most cases superior, certainly when one puts these qualities collectively together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool insulates against cold&mdash;everyone knows that&mdash;but it also insulates against heat. It is water repellent; a lot of other fibres are not. It is flame resistant, which is very significant, particularly for young children. It wears longer than most similar fibres. It can absorb water, which means it is healthy to wear. It keeps its shape, which means that it resists wrinkling. Hence wool is very popular in such things as suits. It also holds its colour, so it dyes beautifully when people want to dye various colours into it. It also resists dirt and has low static qualities&mdash;another very important quality. When it comes to comfort, it really has no equal. For all of those reasons, wool has been and will continue to be a dominant fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I would like to come back to a couple of points about Hamilton as the wool capital of the world. Before I do, I would just remind the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) that I certainly believe that the shearing industry and those who work as shearers have made a massive contribution to the industry and will continue to do so. From my experience, shearing is one of the most difficult jobs ever undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talks about the problems of New Zealand shearers. I suggest that he ought to have a look at what is happening in Australia: in many cases it is Australians who are breaking down award conditions, by doing things that they want to, such as shearing over the weekends. Sure, not all want to shear over the weekends but, if they happen to want to, why should they not be able to do it? That is probably one of the major reasons why the shearing industry will probably lead the way in the breaking down of the rigid, centralised wage fixing system that has been a blight on this nation's horizon for so many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look now, in the brief time I have available to me, at why Hamilton is the wool capital of the world. There are a number of very significant factors. First of all, within a radius of 80 kilometres there are nine million sheep. We have consistently seen some of the highest priced wool sold from the Hamilton region and two of the very well-known studs, Sierra Park and Rockbank, have consistently been obtaining record prices. We can boast the world's speed shearing champion, David Ryan. In 1979 he shore 500 merino sheep in 7 1/2 hours&mdash;a record that stands unbeaten today and is written up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guinness Book of Records</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To look a bit further, in the Hamilton region we have over 20 different breeds. We have 30 per cent of the national wool clip. We have a world famous sheep show there every year, known as the Sheep Vention, which I am very proud to say was opened last year by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some very innovative industries; there is one on display over there in the Great Hall now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to speak in this House today on National Wool Day. I note that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has already spoken and has a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, at page 4471, almost word for word in the terms of a private member's motion moved by me in June last year seeking a ban on the export of merino genetic material. Whilst he was not prepared to support my motion last year, and in fact members of the coalition opposed it, I am pleased to see that he now appears to agree with me that we must retain our competitive edge by protecting our unique genetic stock. I congratulate him, I must say, for his efforts today and also the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) for supporting me on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many hardworking men and women in the wool industry in my electorate of Kennedy whose livelihoods depend on the Australian wool industry. I am sure that they will all appreciate the efforts of this Parliament in focusing attention on the wool industry through National Wool Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) should also be commended for this initiative. Hopefully, by a focusing of national attention on the wool industry there will be direct economic benefits to the industry through increased sales and more concerted efforts to value add in our wool production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as being significant to woolgrowers and shearers in my electorate, the wool industry is also significant to all Australians. Obviously, the industry is of great economic importance, as it contributes about 25 per cent of the value of agricultural production. Until recently, wool was our major export commodity. I also hope there will be social benefits as a result of today's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 18 months ago in this House I opened my maiden speech with the following list of names: Bennett, Blackwell, Brown, Forrester, Fothergill, Griffin, Hamilton, D. Murphy, E. Murphy, Prince, Smith-Barry, Taylor and Stuart. These are the names of the 13 strike leaders who were gaoled in May 1891 for their part in the great shearers strike that changed the course of Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the great shearers strike at Barcaldine in my electorate led to the birth of the Australian Labor Party. In my maiden speech I also described my elation when, in May 1990, as the first Labor member for Kennedy for nearly a quarter of a century, I marched at the head of a Labour Day rally in Barcaldine. I also described my sense of history and how I could almost see the striking shearers camped under the shade of the famous Tree of Knowledge, fighting for the principles of unionism and the right to a decent wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It greatly disturbs me that while we celebrate National Wool Day in this Parliament Australian shearers are camping out on the lawns of Parliament House, calling attention to their fight for the same basic principles as the shearers at Barcaldine fought for some 101 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone involved with the wool industry has been through a traumatic period of change. Last year we saw the abolition of the reserve price scheme, and national attention was regularly focused on the woolgrowers, who were burdened with a massive debt. It was recognised by the industry and the Government that as a nation we could not afford to continue with the reserve price scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and my colleagues on the other side of this House acted together to ensure the survival of the wool industry. The abolition of the reserve price scheme virtually had bipartisan support in this House, and the prognosis for woolgrowers has been improving ever since. The prognosis for Australian shearers has not been so good. It is now time for both sides of this House to act together to ensure the survival of the Australian shearing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Workers Union estimates that over 42 per cent of the Australian woolclip is shorn by New Zealand shearers. Why? Because the New Zealand shearers are prepared to work at below award conditions. Why are they prepared to breach award conditions? I believe that there are three main reasons, and they are all economic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, while things have certainly been tough in Australia, they have been catastrophic across the Tasman. Thousands of economic refugees have fled New Zealand since the conservative Bolger Government came to power. The National Party Government in New Zealand introduced a goods and services tax that has had a detrimental effect on hundreds of thousands of New Zealand families. At the same time, it has introduced Dickensian industrial legislation aimed at breaking the unions and devastating the wages and working conditions of New Zealand men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minimum wage in New Zealand is equivalent to $A4.60 per hour. Employers constantly negotiate down to this level. With the union movement under attack, desperate workers have to accept minimum wages and disastrous working conditions. As a consequence of these radical right wing economic policies, jobless New Zealanders have escaped across the Tasman, where they are prepared to work in below award conditions because they know they would be far worse off in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the exchange rate between Australia and New Zealand makes any dollar earned in Australia worth a lot more in New Zealand, which makes it easier for New Zealanders to live on lower than award Australian wages back home. Finally, the New Zealand shearers have been able to take advantage of the closer economic relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand. Under this agreement, any New Zealander working in Australia for less than six months, does not pay any tax in Australia. What tax is paid is paid in New Zealand. If New Zealand shearers do not work for the rest of the year in New Zealand, often they can end up paying no tax at all. Those who are here for more than six months, are taxed at the much lower non-resident rate. It is no wonder that economic refugees from New Zealand are flocking to Australia, and it is no wonder that Australian shearers are fed up with such an unfair scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hard fought award conditions of Australian shearers are in fact being whittled away. Yesterday I visited the shearers camped out on the lawns of Parliament House. I must say that they are a very well-organised professional group. Just as they know how to shear sheep, they also know how to get their message across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) agreed to review the double tax agreement with New Zealand. The signing of the CER agreement in July 1990 effectively created a one job market across the Tasman, and it is only fair that the tax treatment of individuals in that market should reflect this. Whilst I commend the Treasurer for his commitment to review the double tax agreement in the course of negotiations with his New Zealand counterparts, the fact of the matter is that negotiations at this level do take time; and one thing that Australian shearers are running out of is time, along with money and patience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is a more sinister side to all this which greatly concerns me. I have been contacted by many shearers in my electorate and across Australia on this issue many times over the past 12 months, and I keep hearing that there are certain groups which are actively encouraging New Zealand shearers to come to Australia. It has been put to me that the National Farmers Federation and certain sections of the United Graziers Association are actively seeking out New Zealand shearers. Evan McFarlane, in an interview with a New Zealand paper last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's a big push by the National Farmers Federation to use these New Zealand shearers. If they get enough over here they'll break down the award and get a seven-day week and if they get a seven-day week there won't be a rise in award rates for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>That is taken from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Zealand Herald</EMPHASIS> of 23 November 1991. McFarlane is no extremist. He is a renowned shearer who has won the highly prized Longreach Diamond shearers competition three times. He is highly respected in and out of woolsheds. His fears are backed up by the fact that it makes economic sense for the New Zealand shearers to want to come here, and there will always be some unscrupulous woolgrowers willing to exploit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long term consequences of this mutually beneficial arrangement could be devastating for the Australian union movement. It would be a tragic irony if the industry which spawned the great Australian union movement and the Labor Party were destroyed by the indifference of members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook has agreed to look into the matter, and I sincerely hope that we can come up with a rational and sensible plan of action to protect the hard earned award conditions of Australian shearers. Whilst I certainly congratulate all those who have been involved in National Wool Day today and I certainly hope that this is the start of many national wool days, I do say that we must act together to stop the fleecing of Aussie shearers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with all other speakers in this debate on National Wool Day, I am proud to rise in this House and commend both the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) on the initiative they have shown in producing the National Wool Day; and I also pay a tribute to all of those people who have made possible the magnificent display currently in the Great Hall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool Council of Australia, the wool selling brokers, the Australian Wool Corporation, the staff of Parliament House and parliamentarians generally have cooperated in a superb way, and it is characteristic of the energy of the honourable member for O'Connor and the organising capacity of the member for Stirling that all of this has come together in such an effective way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is appropriate today to be particularly political or parochial in the comments one wants to make about a national industry on a national day. It is certainly not the day for cheap political point scoring, when the day has really been characterised by bipartisan cooperation. But I do want to refer to the particular pride that I, as the member for Wakefield, have in the Australian wool industry. While I acknowledge that it is an Australia-wide industry, it is appropriate for me, as the member for Wakefield, to put on record the role that my electorate has played in the development of the wool industry in the State of South Australia. While I want to avoid being parochial, I think one would have to acknowledge that South Australia is dotted with the names of famous people who have made a real contribution to Australia's wool industry and to the genetic improvement in this fibre that we all celebrate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one thinks of the names of those people who historically have been involved in the industry in South Australia, one invariably finds the predecessors to the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan)&mdash;people such as the Melroses; the Duttons, who established the famous Anlaby stud that is now part of the Mosey family; A.B. Murray, who first established the Mount Crawford stud and then became involved in the Cappeedee stud that continues to this day; and the Hon. Walter Duffield, with his involvement in Koonoona. One also finds, of course, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) has appropriately acknowledged, the essential role played by the Hawker family in establishing the Bungaree stud right in the centre of the electorate of Wakefield. Parallel to this and also part of that clear development has been the Angus family at Hill River. We would all be aware of the involvement of the Ashby family in a number of family studs&mdash;originally the Ashrose stud&mdash;and the prominence of Mr Rob Ashby who today is Chairman of the Stud Merino Breeders Association of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my comments, I want to refer briefly to the role of the Collinsville stud because the stud has had some unfortunate financial circumstances in recent times which have meant that its role has been somewhat clouded. We need to recognise that, if we are serious about the continuing role that the wool industry will have in generating exports for Australia and in continuing the proud tradition of the merino line, then we have to recognise the work that was done historically in genetic improvement and is continuing to be done in the Collinsville stud. It is producing sheep that are of the Collinsville build and are appropriate for the station country so characteristic of South Australia&mdash;that magnificent country out to the east of Collinsville on which their reputations were so built. This morning we have to acknowledge the role of all of those mid-north studs in improving the genetic line of sheep available to Australian breeders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is useful today to set the Australian sheep, and particularly the merino, industry in an historic perspective. It is worth remembering that 200 years ago there were very few sheep in Australia at all. Today the figure is difficult to estimate, but it is probably 140 million, 160 million. On the First Fleet, there were ducks and geese, and goats and donkeys, some breeds of which, of course, have continued to make a contribution to Australian agriculture, but no single animal has been identified with the economic success of Australia as has the merino. The merino that first came to Australia landed here in 1797 on 26 June when Colonel Gordon's stock at Cape Town was sold up. It is significant to note that it was sold for #4 a head and, because that figure on those particular rams and ewes was seen as being too high, the purchase was split between a Captain Waterhouse and a Captain Kent. An additional #1.10 per head was incurred in the feed and transportation costs from Cape Town to Sydney Cove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On arrival in Australia, this particular flock was bought by Macarthur. In July 1803 the first of the specimens of wool were sent to the United Kingdom, and I will quote from the book,<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Top Paddock</EMPHASIS>, where these comments were made about Australia's first wool shipment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lord Hobart, the English secretary of state, received a memorandum on 26 July 1803, that read:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The specimens of wool that Captain Macarthur has with him have been inspected by the best judges of wool in this kingdom; and they are of the opinion that it possesses a softness superior to many of the wools of Spain; it is certainly equal to the very best obtained from there. The sheep producing this fine wool are of the Spanish kind, sent originally from Holland to the Cape of Good Hope and taken hence to Port Jackson. . . Captain Macarthur has now about 4000 sheep, all the rams being of the Spanish breed. He calculates that they will double themselves every two and a half years; and that in twenty years they will be so increased as to produce as much fine wool as is now imported from Spain at an annual expense of #1 800 000.'</PARA>
<PARA>That was the start of what was to be the most significant rural export ever experienced by Australia and probably by any colony. I think it is appropriate that we recognise the key role that wool production has played in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that from 1977 to 1990 Australia's wool production, thanks to the genetic improvement of its stud, went from 667 million kilograms to 1,100 million kilograms, an increase of 64 per cent. In the same period, 1977 to 1990, the South African clip fell from 106 million kilograms to 99 million kilograms and, surprisingly, the Argentinean clip also fell. It is a credit to our woolgrowers that, in the face of difficult economic times, the Australian wool clip not only has continued to rise but also has continued to make a key contribution to the success of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Calculations made show that in 1807 the flocks available to Australian sheep producers cut barely 1 1/4lb per head, an eighth of today's average fleece rate. In fact, the average fleece rate for all Australian sheep is currently 4 1/2 kilograms per head and has been increasing for the last four decades. However, the merino fleece on our top rams is four times the average. These figures highlight the potential that the Australian wool industry has to increase its production and to continue to make a key contribution to the revival and recovery of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry makes a very useful benchmark for all other segments of the Australian economy. As the honourable member for O'Connor said in the debate this morning, the wool industry offers key value adding. Much of that value adding can be seen in the display accompanying the wool auction that is occurring in the Great Hall today. I have had little difficulty, Mr Deputy Speaker, in embracing the comments made by previous speakers and in paying tribute to Australian merino sheep, to Australian wool, and to the superiority of the Australian wool clip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be inappropriate for me not to conclude with a comment also recognising the real qualities of the people who make the Australian wool industry work. There are people out there who are making it work in the face of very difficult circumstances. There are people in all our rural electorates who are facing real poverty but who are continuing to hang on to what is a proud tradition. They are exercising innovation, integrity and, in fact, a sense of adventure in developing new markets for Australian wool and in offering value added opportunities for Australian wool. I want to pay a tribute to the Australians who have traditionally been associated with the industry and who in 1992 continue to be associated with the industry. They should take a real pride in what has happened in the Great Hall today. </PARA>

The sale that is being conducted in the Great Hall at the moment was scheduled for Newcastle, and we are very proud that the sale is being conducted here within Parliament House. We normally have some nine to 10 sales per year in Newcastle. Sales start on a Monday when brokers, usually exporters, price the wool, and on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday they attend the auction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I had the opportunity in the Great Hall to look at some of the fleeces and the items of apparel as they were being prepared for display. I also had the opportunity to talk to some of the woolgrowers from the region of New England which relates very closely to the Hunter region, to the port of Newcastle and to the sales that are conducted in Newcastle. The wool being auctioned at the moment in the Great Hall is actually still in Newcastle. A special catalogue, Newcastle sale 8/40, has been prepared and printed for this historic sale. I did listen to the sale this morning and I had great difficulty in understanding some of the numbers and the speed at which the calls were made&mdash;for a moment I almost thought I was in Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is great that the sale is taking place in Parliament House and that that focus is being placed upon the performance of our wool industry and, most importantly, that the sale being conducted here is one that was scheduled for Newcastle. There is an expectation that some 20,000 people will see the display today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that in respect of the sale and the wool that is being marketed here, I do want to join with my colleagues in making some comment about the position of Australian shearers. We all share in the congratulations about the achievement of our wool industry. We all recognise the enormous importance it is to the Australian economy and to the well-being of most Australians. But we do need, I believe, to ensure that those working in the wool industry, particularly the shearers, do get a fair go, in Australian terms. The problem that is occurring at the moment is not a new problem; it is a problem that has been going on for some years. I am satisfied that there are anomalies in the taxation arrangements that allow New Zealand shearers to get the edge over Australian shearers, but I hope that this matter can be sorted out on an equitable basis as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I had the opportunity to talk to Mr Darrell Carter of Whyworry Park at Uralla. He produces truly fine, superfine, specialty wool. We spoke about the move to withdraw sales from Newcastle and to centralise them in the three centres of Sydney, Melbourne, and I think Fremantle. The problem is that it takes a full day to turn around a load of bales or a container from Yennora to Botany. Yet, working from Newcastle, a truck can go down from Newcastle at least once and often twice in the course of one day. Newcastle is the natural outlet for the New England. Mr Carter and his family, his dad Ray Carter, his wife Robyn, are an excellent example of what much of Australia's manufacturing industry ought to be doing&mdash;taking a product, refining it to a high standard of quality, maximising their care and preparation of that product, and maximising their return on the product as a result of their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the kind of policy that needs to be followed by so many other operators in Australia's manufacturing industry. They need to pick up the model that the Carters are using at Uralla and put it to work in their own Australian business. In the New England, growers prefer road transport because it is more convenient for handling&mdash;there is no contamination, there is no puncturing of bales by handling equipment and the bales of wool are not left uncovered, as I am told can happen with rail. I congratulate the Carter family on their contribution to the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say in conclusion that we are very proud of the sales being conducted in Newcastle and we want to see a continuation of those sales in Newcastle.

It is something that people perhaps have not comprehended that, for all that the industry has been seen by some&mdash;including, regrettably, members of the Government&mdash;as being yesterday's industry, it is an industry which I believe has as good a future as it had a past. It is an industry which has enormous flexibility. The product itself breathes and for that reason they have not to date been able to produce any synthetic alternative that is anywhere near as good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as the honourable member who preceded me said, the industry really is a product of the men and women who make it. I have been tremendously impressed over the years in which I have been involved at the way in which they have been able to tighten their belts and they have been able to present their own image of a product that they wish to produce, in spite of the exigencies of government and what it does. If National Wool Day does nothing else, what we should be doing is saying thank you to those family farmers who have really made the industry as great as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me, however, is that there are three things that plague the industry at the moment. Although I have not much time, I would like to say that I am most concerned about the price volatility of the auction system. I blame the Government, as I have done on a number of occasions, for the circumstances that led to the elimination of the minimum reserve price scheme. But that having gone, we have to understand that the pipeline now represented by the stockpile&mdash;currently held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission&mdash;is one that is being replaced by a stockpile held along the lines of those who are wool dealers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the industry's prospects, given the world volatility; the collapse in the Nikkei stock index yesterday; the problems in Japan and its economy; the breaking apart of the former Soviet Union into the new Commonwealth of Independent States; the difficulty in obtaining sufficient foreign exchange in countries of eastern Europe; and the real loss that so many of our major wool buyers suffer because of the way in which the Government led them to believe that the minimum reserve price scheme would be maintained, and then pulled the plug and left them to carry the loss. There is no man more responsible than the man who is now the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on tariffs. He says one thing today and then another tomorrow. Unfortunately he, and the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, failed to understand that, when somebody speaks as a Prime Minister or a Minister, their words should be capable of being believed. Unfortunately, the wool buyers of the world believed Mr Kerin's word&mdash;and how wrong they were. They suffered enormous losses. The Government has not been prepared&mdash;although I understand that there is still one matter before the courts on this question&mdash;to pick up any part of those losses; yet they were incurred specifically because John Kerin told them that the reduction in price would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now, it is the individual woolgrower who is going to be subjected to that wool price volatility. In that climate of price uncertainty and demand uncertainty, really, it is important that every Australian knows that this concept of a wool day is a way by which we can ensure that some of the elements of that volatility will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems for the individual growers. The seasons are still not good. There seems to be a mood around this place that the drought has gone. I can tell people that it has not. Also, a lot of my growers say that they would like to know exactly what is happening with the money they have invested in the Wool Realisation Commission and in the Australian Wool Corporation. There is no certainty of just where and to what degree the Wool Realisation Commission is going to see funds returned to growers; yet they have made an enormous investment there, and they would like to have a more open analysis of where their funds have gone. I commend the concept, and commend all those who have made that magnificent display in the Great Hall possible, and, above all, I commend to everybody the qualities and properties of that magnificent fibre&mdash;the product of the merinos and other sheep that really constitutes Australia's wool flock. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak fairly close to the end of this debate and pay tribute to all those who have been involved in the organisation of the National Wool Day. It has been an extremely successful day and anyone who has moved through the Great Hall, moved around the demonstration shearing, and had a look at some of the exhibits in the Great Hall and at the front of Parliament House, will appreciate that there has been a great atmosphere. This has particularly resulted from the initiative of four members: the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ron Edwards), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), as well as me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four of us were able to get it together. I guess, if we had looked for a promotional organisation, there might not have been quite as much moving from crisis to crisis today&mdash;which seemed that way to us a bit; although I know many people have said how smoothly it has gone&mdash;but it may have cost $20,000 or $30,000 to do the work that the offices of the four members have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute particularly to Norm Haywood from the office of the honourable member for O'Connor and to Ruth Webber from the office of the honourable member for Stirling for the outstanding extracurricular work that they have done in the organisation of this. Four members from the four parties represented in this House have been able to get together on promoting one of Australia's most important export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of cooperation from other people and groups as well, notably the Australian Wool Corporation. I believe that the effort put in by the Corporation has been of great benefit and, together with the effort put in by the people conducting the auction, it has been a great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had support from people, such as Gordon Allen of the ACT Lessees Association, who have supplied sheep. In the Australian Capital Territory farmers do not own their properties. They lease them from government. Even after years of operation, they can be put off their farms with only two or three months notice. That is not a particularly good way to operate a business, but that is how they have been doing it. Honourable members should note that this area had sheep a long time before it had parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had a lot of support from Tralee, which has a great combination of tourism and wool production. Today, eight coach loads of people are going out to Tralee to have a look at the demonstrations that are put on there, and Tralee has also put in a great effort here. The Australian Workers Union has contributed today with shearing demonstrations. Milton Charnock has brought in his sheep to shear. He gives a very effective demonstration not only of ordinary shearing but also of blade shearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great things about today is that we are linking education, tourism and the important wool industry. I have had support in my local area from Neville Gorman and Claire Smith of Bombala and Cuppacumbalong. They have contributed woollen garments and other garments that have been shown. Students have come from all over the place. Thousands of people have come from all over the place. People from all over the world have come here today. They have been able to look at our wool industry as a result of the excellent work that has been done by the wide range of organisations I have met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation Jumbuck, which produced the mini-jumbuck which is shown here, has also put in quite a bit of money and effort today. Great work has been done by all these organisations. I pay particular tribute to the people who came here to buy wool, the people who came here to see, the people from textile classes, the people from throughout Australia who have made the effort to come here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not so very long ago that there was some scepticism amongst officials and the wool industry itself about the prospects for wool. It has done a little bit better than we expected, although perhaps not as well as we hoped. There is still quite a way to go. It was said only a few years ago that research and development may offer the chance to obtain an immediate lift in demand in wool. It may not be sufficiently rapid to respond to the short term imbalance in supply and demand, but with effort it can happen. Today we have made a tremendous effort. Today we have done our level best across all parties to make sure that it will happen. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that it is a perfect delight to see a mini-jumbuck from my electorate sitting on the dispatch box. I hope it stays there for many a day. All sorts of things can happen in the days leading up to Wool Day. In recent days I have been called a squatter by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in this House and other places. I do not find that a term of derision, but the Treasurer obviously does or he would not have used it. I have to say that he should be careful because his grandfather was a squatter, and one can only conclude that he would sell not only his grandmother for a song, as the saying goes, but his grandfather as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things need to be said on this day about this great wool industry of ours, an industry that will be successful for many years to come. Firstly, I would like to proffer the observation that there will never be another reserve price scheme in the Australian wool industry. I do not think there is much point in wasting valuable time in discussing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I was very much in favour of the conservative scheme as it was run in the early days, the facts are that in the future no-one will finance it. No bank will finance it, no government will underwrite that bank finance, and the growers will not finance it&mdash;and neither should they really, because they are still owed about $2 billion from the last scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, of course, to replace that scheme. We are starting to see a rise in the use of the futures market, a market that was started many years ago in London, was taken over by Sydney, and then met its demise as the reserve price scheme started to take the fluctuations out of the market. But we are now starting to see a rise in the use of the futures market again as people realise that large fluctuations in the market are now, again, a fact of life. Those fluctuations will get greater, but they will not necessarily be bad. They will give rise to the greater use not only of futures but also of agreed forward contracts, direct selling, the rise of a market in options and the use in this industry of financial instruments, some of which have not even yet been devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that, when we have sold the wool stockpile in a few years&mdash;a lesser number of years than I would suggest that the Government has in mind&mdash;there will actually be a cash surplus left over and above the money that was borrowed from outside lenders, contrary to the original belief and the belief of many. If that be the case, then some of that cash surplus could be used to repay the $1.7 billion or perhaps $2 billion that is owed to the growers that I mentioned before. My own view is that the way to do that would be to pay the money out at so much in the dollar, with some minor adjustments made for the interest factor, depending on whether people's contributions came in in 1987, 1989 or later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are, I would like to suggest, some dark moves afoot to pump some millions of dollars of taxpayers' money into various wool processing companies on the basis that the Government will be seen to be helping value add in this country. We have heard that it is, or was, the Government's intention to pump in amounts of as much as $25m to help to provide capital for a German wool combing company to start up in this country. I have heard that it may pump some more money into a company in my electorate. People tell me that in Queensland people are anticipating some more capital; taxpayers' money will go in there. It is an outrageous proposition that some companies, especially foreign companies, should be singled out for capital benefit to the exclusion of small or older players in this matter. It amounts to picking winners within an industry in the worst possible way, to the exclusion of those who compete thereafter and have been competing prior to those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, if this subsidised industry, wool processing, turns out to be less efficient than the processing elsewhere in the world, the eventual result will finally bear down on Australian wool prices. In other words, this false subsidisation could have quite the opposite effect to that originally planned and could have a deleterious result. I hope that is not the case. I hope that the market will be allowed to continue to work and the TCFDA will use the funds it has for innovation and forward looking arrangements. Finally, I would like to say that I wish that this industry will continue in the way that it was going only a few years ago. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I first offer my appreciation and congratulations to both the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) for what they have done in recognising this day. I had the opportunity earlier today to visit the displays in the Parliament and it was quite an interesting experience. I think someone mentioned before that listening to the auctioneers is, from time to time, somewhat like Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular week has been an important week for our Parliament. Often I think the theatre of Question Time overtakes some of the more important debates in this place. I think this week in this place we have had three important debates where there has been very much a bipartisan attitude. I refer particularly to the statement by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on the Government's response to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Also, yesterday, we heard a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Cambodia, and we heard bipartisan speeches in relation to that. The debate today also reflects very much a bipartisan attitude in this Parliament. I think it is really encouraging to see that when we really want to we can all work together in the greater interest of this great country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the interest in this great country, we cannot talk about Australia as a great country without talking about the wool industry. All who have been associated with the wool industry&mdash;for a lot longer than I have been around here&mdash;refer to it as probably the most important industry to our country. They know what it has done for us over many years. But I do not think there is an honourable member in this place who does not have some association with the wool industry, whether it be those members who have graziers in their electorates or those of us who have woollen mills and wool scouring plants in our electorates. When it comes down to city electorates, there are probably people with the stores that sell the wool. There are no honourable members in this place who can say that they do not have an association with the industry in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a lot of people work in that industry and I would like also to associate my comments with those of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls), who spoke earlier about the plight of the shearers. I am very pleased to acknowledge here today the great history that the shearers have with my Party, the Australian Labor Party. Last year I took the opportunity during the centenary of the Australian Labor Party to visit parts of the Kennedy electorate, particularly around Barcaldine and Longreach&mdash;which is well-known as an historical place for the labour movement. Interestingly enough, my father grew up in that part of the world, and was actually born in a town called Muttaburra. I understand there are a lot of New Zealanders living there now. Of course, my family had a long association in that part of the world, my grandfather having worked on many sheep stations, also my dad until the time of the war. So everyone has some association with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there has been a lot of mention here today about value adding. I understand that only about 10 per cent of wool is actually value added in Australia. That is something that needs to be addressed in a big way. I mentioned earlier woollen mills in the city of Ipswich, in my electorate of Oxley. Woollen mills formed a very important industry there once, but now there are none left, unfortunately. That is something we really should look at. We did have a wool scouring plant operating there not so long ago, but due to some environmental problems it closed. But it is still there and so are the people who owned it, and there are still attempts being made to get that plant going again. We are talking about employing some 50 or 60 people in those sorts of plants, and that is a very important point in job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the wool industry, I think we are fortunate in having an industry which, as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to before, whilst it has had a great past, also should have a great future. I am sure it has when we see those displays in this place here today. Our friends from the National Party with their displays today are quite something, and I also acknowledge them for bringing to the attention of the House the quality of the products that wool can produce for us. Earlier, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) went right through the great qualities of wool as a product. Those remarks are quite important in showing just how good wool is, and what it can provide for us as one of our most important industries. Once again, I would like to congratulate all those associated with this National Wool Day today, particularly the honourable members for O'Connor and Stirling in the activities here today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Riverina-Darling, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I stand today in the House to speak on the wool industry. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and his tireless staffer, Norm Haywood, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) and his staff, Ruth and Margaret, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), on organising this day today. As I said, it is a great pleasure to speak on the wool industry as the member for Riverina-Darling. We all know the Riverina region of New South Wales is extremely famous for its great wool production, and for the great wool studs that are there. I know it is a bit dangerous to mention some, but Uardry comes to mind, also Wanganella, Pooginook and Goolgumbla. There are many more which I would like to mention but time does not permit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the wool industry and at my part of the world, Riverina-Darling, we find that the very ethos, the historical essence of Australia, comes from those areas. There were people like Father Hartigan who, under the nom de plume, John O'Brien, wrote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Around the Boree Log</EMPHASIS>, Lawson and Banjo Paterson&mdash;many poets worked in those areas. Many of their poems which inspire many Australians were initiated in that part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could speak a lot about the Riverina, but most people already know a great deal about that region. The Riverina plains are perhaps the best sheep country not only in Australia but in the world. So I pay tribute to that area and to the people in that area who are so important to the wool industry. One of the areas I would like to talk about today is the western division of New South Wales, which also produces a great deal of wool. Of course, the western division is a unique area. It extends down from the dog-proof fence in the north. Those people who have seen the dog-proof fence would know what a tremendous structure it is and what an important job it does in keeping wild dogs and dingoes out of that sheep producing area of the north. Anyone who has seen sheep that have been savaged by dingoes would know just how important that fence is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main centres of the western division are Broken Hill and Tibooburra, White Cliffs, Wilcannia, Menindee, Cobar, Tilpa, Hillston, Ivanhoe, Pooncarie, Hay, Balranald, Nymagee, Mount Hope, Lake Cargelligo, Hatfield, Oxley and others. While they may have a romantic air about their names, they all have people who lead fairly difficult and hard lives. In fact, we know that at the moment much of that area is in the grip of drought. For example, in phoning around to find out exactly what the position was, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) found out that in some areas wool carrying capacity is down by over half. In fact, one property has only about 2 per cent of its sheep left on it. That is why I think it is very important that this industry that has done so much for the welfare of the people of Australia be looked after in its time of need. What we really do need to look at in those areas is making sure that when those people can restock when the drought is over those survive&mdash;and I hope that all of them do survive&mdash;and that the Federal Government provides some low interest loans. They are facing a very difficult period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The western division contains over 1,500 properties. The average size of the property towards Walgett is about 4,000 hectares. Walgett is in the electorate of Parkes. As we come towards Tibooburra, there may be properties of 40,000 hectares carrying 5,000 sheep. The area is semi-arid: the rainfall is about nine inches per year. I believe that in most of Australia farming involves the management of drought. I would say that nearly 80 per cent of Australia is covered by that semi-arid area, so we must ensure that that area is productive and that we can maintain our people on it to produce wealth for Australia. The value of the western wool clip is about $315m, so we can see how important that is to our overseas earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the people out in that area are great Australian characters. They work hard and they live in harsh conditions. I would like today to pay a tribute to those women who work in those western areas&mdash;the wives, the daughters, those who are related to the people there trying to do something to produce wool for Australia. Those women of that western area have always been great stalwarts, great pioneers of Australia and great citizens of Australia. Finally, the wool industry has carried Australia for many years and I believe that it will continue to do so, provided we give it those initiatives and give it that framework to allow it to continue in its very important work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, rather than just look back, I want to try to give one or two constructive thoughts about the future and the sorts of things that I think we need to do to trade our way out of this disastrous situation. Some members of this House would be aware of the faith and commitment that I, personally, consistently apply in terms of looking at the application of innovation and technology to all the areas of business and commerce, and the good that I think it can do our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback proposals that the coalition launched late last year, of course, spell out the economic and structural environment that a coalition government will bring to this country. I want to emphasise that we can supplement that by working to world's best standards in the way that we run our business and our industry. We have to work smarter; and it is not just a question of inventing one or two clever ideas that will suddenly be the salvation of the country. That is not what is going to do it. What we have to do is to apply working smarter technology and innovation to every aspect of the commercial life of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a good history of coming up with some clever ideas: the research people push them out for the business world and nobody wants to invest and pick them up. Then we have that subsequent disappointment because we do not pick up those bright ideas. Business and industry and the management in those areas have to start to say, `When we have a problem, we turn to our research areas, we say what the problem is and we ask them to come up with some solution. We are in an economic war and we have to go to our boffins and our clever people to come up with solutions to our problems. We have to pull those from our research communities'. When that happens, management is much more likely to apply those new ideas and to implement them to help the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, a number of key elements that we need to achieve this. There are some fundamentals that I just want to talk about briefly. I want to make very quick reference to three. First of all, we should be talking about structures and not products. We should not concentrate on providing mechanisms for supporting, from taxpayers' money, specific products or processes, individual industries or companies; it should not be about supporting bounties, tariffs, grants or tax concessions and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should be doing is concentrating on creating a climate for across the board innovation so that anyone can get into the market and compete. Some enterprises will, of course, succeed; some will fail. But the successful ones will be built on a sound commercial basis and will have the incentive to make good ideas work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, when considering the likely impact of individual policies and legislation, to recognise the desirability of building on our existing strengths. Australia already has some established leading edge science and technology activities, and in these and other areas of development it is appropriate to encourage clusters of excellence and mutual dependence, wherever practicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to beef up our education and skills. There is a shortage of trained people in the science and technology fields and we have an urgent need to introduce into the education system a bias towards productive studies. We have five arts graduates for every one science or engineering graduate. That is an imbalance that the country should not  sustain. We need to turn that around. We are also losing existing skilled people overseas because of poor pay and poor conditions, but above all due to the uncertainty of the funding of projects, which are often on a year to year basis. There is also, of course, an urgent need to establish this country throughout the Asia-Pacific region as a skills haven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to make is that we must adopt much more of an international perspective. We should encourage the development of knowledge partnerships between Australian and overseas institutions and companies. The formation of international relationships and joint ventures for capital, knowledge acquisition and access to overseas marketing and distribution channels is critical to the successful application of technology in commercial environments, and the Government must ensure that regulatory and other obstacles to such relationships are eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I come towards the end of my time, I grieve for my children and my grandchildren for what they are about to inherit as a result of this Government's activity and for all the other children in this country. We have a country that has the climate, the resources, the basic political stability, and the trained and skilled people in many areas to be a very successful country in this world. Yet what we have seen from the ALP Government over the last few years are wasted years&mdash;years of debt and decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's Fightback package we have the taxation and structural reform ideas that we need. But we also need to encourage a sea change in attitude towards the application of innovation and technology. With lower business costs, freer markets, revolutionised industrial agreements and the take-up of innovation, we can achieve world best standards, we can compete and we can reverse the present trend. We need not hand a lower standard of living to our children and grandchildren after all. But time is short; we need to change. Innovation and technology can be harnessed to the other Fightback measures to offer all Australians hope for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout its long history, Turkey has been a home and refuge to many different racial groups who have prospered and created great civilisations on this ancient land. Modern Turkey is a free and democratic nation. Turkey is a member of NATO and an important ally. Above all, Turkey is a constitutional democracy which protects the rights of its citizens, irrespective of race, religion and sex. Turkey is a nation which has earned and enjoys the respect of the world community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are vast numbers of Turkish citizens of Kurdish ethnic background living in Turkey. Many of these people of Kurdish descent reside in the big cities of Turkey and they make a substantial and worthwhile contribution to the economic, social and political life of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago violence erupted in various parts of Turkey, particularly in the border district of Sirnak where heavily armed terrorists launched a violent attack involving innocent people who were celebrating the religious festival of Nevrouz. These terrorists belong to the Kurdish Workers Party, otherwise known as the PKK. About 1,500 PKK terrorists infiltrated the populace of the town and on the day of the festivities forced hundreds of people, and in particular women and children, at gunpoint into demonstrations and attempted to use them as a human shield. The terrorists even tried to occupy the Governor's office, hang the Governor and hold the building. During the ensuing fight against the police and security forces, the PKK terrorists used rockets, mortars and machine-guns. At least 45 people, particularly from the security forces, lost their lives during these clashes that occurred in Turkey at this time. It was a calculated and premeditated attack on the state of Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to make the distinction between the tragedy of the Kurds in northern Iraq and the events which occurred in Turkey just two weeks ago. The Kurds in northern Iraq have been the victims of a genocidal onslaught by the forces of the Butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein. Indeed, over the last few days, three heavily armed Iraqi divisions are reported to have resumed their assault on the Kurds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of the Iraqi attacks against its Kurdish  citizens, the world has extended its sympathy to them on their terrible plight. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS> of 24 March 1992, the Director of the Centre for Security Policy in Washington, Frank J. Gaffney Jr, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kurdish Workers Party, known as the PKK, has attempted to exploit the sympathy legitimately extended by the international community to the Kurds of Iraq. But it is wholly undeserving of such support. The PKK is an avowedly Marxist organisation, bent on imposing through terrorism its demands for an independent Kurdistan on the democratic government of Turkey. Premier Suleyman Demirel called the weekend's clashes `a declaration of war by the PKK'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal sponsor of the PKK is Syria's Hafez Assad, who permits the party's leadership to be openly headquartered in Damascus and its terrorists to train in the Bekaa Valley. Like its Syrian patrons, the PKK relies heavily on illicit international drug traffic to finance its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main victims of the PKK's attacks are fellow Kurds in south-eastern Turkey, who have been assimilated into the Turkish population, have the democratic rights of all Turkish citizens and are represented in Turkey's parliament and government (the current Foreign Minister, Hikmet Cetin, is an ethnic Kurd). As with terrorist organisations elsewhere&mdash;which attempt to justify violence against civilians by dressing it up as national liberation heroism&mdash;the PKK is primarily engaged in terrorising its ethnic fellows to exacerbate relations between the minority and majority populations.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been reliably ascertained that over the past eight years, members of the PKK have murdered more than 1,000 civilians, men and women, young and old. Most of these casualties were of Kurdish origin. In addition, the PKK has murdered 821 Turkish officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the more heinous acts of barbarism committed by the PKK include these examples: in December 1989, PKK attacked a Kurdish village and murdered 28 people, mainly women and children; on 12 June 1991, PKK terrorists raided a village in Siirt and murdered 27 villagers, including 12 children, seven women and four village guards; on 6 June 1991, PKK terrorists murdered seven villagers in Kahramanmaras, including three women and one child; and, again, on 25 December 1991, Kurdish terrorists bombed a seven-storey shopping mall in Istanbul and 11 innocent people died. The PKK is now receiving logistical and materiel support from Iraq. In return, the PKK is being encouraged by Sadaam Hussein to attack Kurds living in northern Iraq. For example, a few weeks ago, the Kurdish headquarters in northern Iraq was bombed, apparently in an attempt to kill the Iraqi Kurdish leadership. Fortunately, for the Kurds, the leadership escaped unscathed. The acts of barbarism and terrorism by the PKK, that I have described, have shocked the people of Turkey and the Turkish Government. As the Turkish Prime Minister, Suleyman Demirel, said just three days ago:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Use of arms against security forces in a democratic State based on supremacy of law cannot be tolerated. It is the ultimate duty of a State to provide safety for all its citizens and to protect first of all their right to live, the very basis of human rights. In performing this duty, the State has responsibility to isolate those who take up arms against the democratic order and to hand them over to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a democratic system, there are legitimate channels through which people can raise their demands, and structures which duly process them. In Turkey, freely elected representatives of the people are carrying out this function within the legitimate grounds of pluralistic democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Turkish Government has a responsibility, both at law and in the name of humanity, to protect the lives and property of its citizens. It is extraordinary, therefore, to find voices raised in defence of the terrorist activities of the PKK. Terrorism is a scourge of our age. There have been countless denunciations and declarations by the United Nations, and other international bodies, condemning terrorism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after it was elected, the Government of Turkey instituted a number of steps to assist its citizens of Kurdish descent. In a number of areas, there is a strong policy of affirmative action for Kurds. The Government has acknowledged a Kurdish identity and recognised the rights of citizens of Kurdish descent to cultivate their Kurdish identity. However, the PKK is attempting to thwart these reforms. As Frank Gaffney said in the article that I referred to earlier:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge to the U.S.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and other Western democracies sympathetic to the plight of the Kurds will be to differentiate their responses to the incipient Kurd-related crises in Iraq and Turkey. On one hand, the West should oppose with force any renewed assault by Sadaam against the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq. Only by threatening such a response and, if necessary, carrying through on that threat, can civilian lives be protected from Sadaam's renewed predations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for the PKK's activities in Turkey, Washington and other Western capitals&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including Canberra&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">must recognise that they represent a serious terrorist threat to the security of an ally and fellow democracy. The fact that this organisation is made up of people with ethnic ties to the long-suffering Kurds of Iraq would no more legitimise the PKK's destructive activities than the shared nationality of the Khmer Rouge with the people of Cambodia, makes their abhorrent behaviour acceptable. Far from criticising Turkey for dealing forcefully with a renewed campaign of terror on the part of the PKK, the West&mdash;especially the U.S.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should encourage Ankara to deal firmly though discriminately with this terrorist Marxist gang.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government of Turkey is continuing to combat terrorism to the best of its capacity. People should never forget the humanitarian aid extended by the people of Turkey to the Kurds of Iraq, who escaped Sadaam Hussein after the gassing of thousands of them, and more latterly at the end of the Gulf war. The people of Australia have great empathy with the principles of democracy and freedom. I hope that the governments of the United States and Australia recognise the magnificent efforts of the Government of Turkey to try to restore law and order to that wonderful country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issues which the previous coalition speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), was grieving about today related to Australia's standing in the world community. On a different aspect, I want to continue that theme. My theme is to look at education in Australia because I believe that that is at the heart of many of the difficulties with which we are faced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1900 Australia was the No. 1 nation in the world. In 1990 we have slipped to being fifteenth and yet countries in our own region during this period of time have actually increased their standard of living. If we look at economies in the Asian region, we find that, in the last decade, they have grown 2 1/2 times, whereas our economy has not even grown by half. I think that shows to us that somewhere Australia is failing to meet the standards which are being set right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as trading goes, Australia was a great trading nation, being thirteenth in 1961. It is now slipping down that scale and in 1989 was nineteenth in the world. But if we have a look at a country such as South Korea, we find that it was ninety-ninth in the world back in 1960 and is now thirteenth in the world, while Australia was thirteenth and is now nineteenth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So changes are occurring around the world, the consequence of which is that Australia is simply not making the grade. Of course, the honourable member for Aston was pointing to the fact that technology is one of those areas where Australia was not making the grade, and the structures put in place by the present Federal Government in Australia were one of the reasons why it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence is clearly now coming to the fore that we have to up our standards in Australia. If there is any objectivity about it, we can say that within Australia we have maintained education standards. But the rest of the world is going past us. It is bypassing us because the level of skills and knowledge which we are getting through to our young people in our schools and our colleges is not as good, is not as competitive, is not of the same high quality and standard as that which is being achieved around the rest of the world. Otherwise, why is Australia slipping behind?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments do not have <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>any other mechanism really to lift a nation's quality of competitiveness in the world except through education. It is the only avenue whereby we can encourage Australians to do better. The question is: how do we change this downward spiral?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing which we have to do is recognise the fact that Australia has problems in this area. One of the fundamental problems that have occurred is the centralised industrial relations of the Australian Teachers Federation in Australia. It is a critical factor as to why education has not gone ahead. I am not referring to the quality of teachers but to the industrialised structure which we have in the teaching system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we have to educate our people more effectively to be competitive. To achieve this, there is a much broader role, of course, than just what governments can do, but governments have an important role to play in ensuring that knowledge and skills are transmitted to our young people for future generations. If we do not do that to the best of our capacity, then we are handicapping our children and future generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn now, in particular, to some of the processes and systems changes which are occurring in Australia, some of which are good and positive, but there are aspects of the education systems in our schools which are not satisfactory and which need improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable members to a news item of March 23 this year. It refers to a test of mathematical skills done by university entrants at Melbourne University. What we find is that 44 per cent of 654 first-year students passed the mathematical skills test at the University of Melbourne. In other words, there was a 56 per cent failure rate among year 12 students going into university at what the university regarded as a satisfactory level. What is really disturbing about it is that, under the changed Victorian Certificate of Education, these results are 14 per cent lower than those students were achieving under the old Higher School Certificate. This is disturbing because we are being told that as we put these new systems into place we are going to get a better quality. People argue about whether such a test is objective or subjective, but this measurement is as objective as we can get and standards are obviously dropping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania also we have moved to a Tasmanian certificate of education and I want to raise a few queries about that move. There is a good basis for moving towards encouraging skill development, but there are problems in authenticating the work of students. There has been a change away from having objectivity in our assessments. How do we authenticate project work which is done at home? How do we know it is entirely the student's work? How do we have teachers who can verify these things? These concerns are raised about the processes which are now developing within our schools. Yet at the end of the day students are going to be given As or Bs or Cs, but we will not really know whether the work was theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to verification, how do we know that the standards being required within our schools or between our schools are the same? This is the case with the new system in Tasmania. By way of illustration, within the Tasmanian system there are courses, which are called B courses, for year 9 and year 10 students. These courses are meant to have a timetable of approximately 100 hours within the schools, and the school board is quite happy to accept plus or minus 10 per cent. But in schools within my own electorate I have found that the variation is from 80 to 120 hours for the same courses. I wonder whether parents really understand, or whether employers understand, that there is this great variation. Can we really say that children who are getting 80 hours in one subject in one school as against children getting 120 hours in the same subject in another school are getting a fair deal?  Will this maintain credibility in the eyes of the public?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period of time when we have seen changes in Australian education, I believe that we have seen a decrease in objectivity of the instruments of assessment testing used in schools and an increase in the subjectivity. With criterion based assessment, or common assessment tasks as in Victoria, I do not know how we assess and maintain reliability between schools as to whether a child participates well in group dynamics or works independently,  and I do not think the parents or the public generally understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great need for public credibility in our education. If the public loses confidence, I do not believe that that education system can be maintained. It behoves all of us in parliament to ensure that education does maintain its public credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I mention what a lecturer at the University of Tasmania has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students and parents are being sold short because of the drift away from challenging academic courses.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe this is occurring throughout Australia, and we have a responsibility to make sure that our students are equipped and have a rigorous education. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A popular saying is that there are three types of lies&mdash;lies, damn lies and statistics. This may well be so, but much can be gleaned from the Bureau of Statistics figures. For a start, they tell us much more than just the official population. They can also show us where growth areas are and help us with future planning of everything from schools to hospitals to shopping centres, nursing homes, child-care centres and bus routes. Just as importantly, they help us decide where the allocation of some $14m of Commonwealth funds each year to the States, Territories and local government actually should go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time, Queensland has been Australia's high growth State. Whether this is due to the climate or the sound economic management and popularity of the Goss Labor Government, people have been flocking to Queensland in droves. Some people may scoff at these claims, but they certainly cannot argue with the figures. The growth rate has been shown once again in the population figures released this week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figures are the first Queensland count from last year's census and they show that there were almost three million people in the State on census night on 6 August last year. This is an increase of some 391,000 on the figure in 1986 and represents an increase of 15 per cent over that period. Of this growth, some 260,000 is attributed to interstate and overseas migration, with the remainder the result of natural growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several noticeable factors in these figures. Firstly, like the rest of Australia, Queensland's population continues to age. In fact, the median age now of a Queenslander is 32, up from 30 in 1986. Secondly, although there was an increase in the number of children up to the age of 14, their actual proportion of the Queensland population declined from 24 per cent to 22 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of Queensland's population growth has occurred in the State's south-eastern corner. Naturally, I was interested to see what population changes had occurred within my own electorate during the period. This shows that the population of my home shire, the Pine River Shire, has grown by almost 14,000, to 88,000. This represents a massive increase of almost 20 per cent. In the neighbouring Caboolture Shire, the population grew by 22,500 to 70,000. This is a staggering increase of almost 50 per cent in just five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one could dispute that such figures hammer home once again the importance of proper forward planning and the need for closer cooperation between all levels of government. These figures come hot on the heels of recent debates in this House about urban planning, sustainable development and the appropriate level of immigration. Nowhere is there more pressing evidence of the need to control the urban sprawl than in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February of this year, the Queensland property consultants Rider and Hunt issued a report which suggested that the Brisbane-Sunshine Coast-Gold Coast triangle could have a population of some four million within 30 years. Brisbane and the Gold Coast are predicted to merge within four years and by the year 2022 the region is expected to overtake Melbourne as Australia's second largest population centre. The State's population is, in fact, a time bomb and it is ready to explode unless we all act now to defuse it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised similar issues to these in this House some 18 months ago, when I pointed out the need to get a much greater level of cooperation between local, State and Commonwealth governments on the issue of urban planning. At that time, we were embarking on the concept of new federalism and I was a bit sceptical as to whether new federalism, in fact, had come too late to overcome many of the population problems which were going to confront the greater Brisbane area. However, there have been some glimmers of hope in the preceding 18 months. The series of Premiers Conferences, although they are stalled somewhat now, has contributed greatly to overcoming issues of service duplication and establishing a degree of uniformity in a range of government services; and these are indeed positive achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $800m better cities program announced in the last Budget is up and running and successful in several States. In Brisbane, not too far from my own electorate, there will be some $31m spent over the next four years in revitalising the inner suburbs of Bowen Hills, New Farm, Fortitude Valley, Newstead and Teneriffe. Although honourable members opposite might scoff at this program, it is the first serious attempt to deal with the idea of revitalising inner city areas of the Australian capitals, and that is an extremely worthwhile objective. I was pleased to see that the Government's commitment to the better cities program was reaffirmed in the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. As a result, the long awaited Brisbane-Gold Coast rail link will become a reality, thus taking pressure off the Pacific Highway and enabling more considered planning of urban development along the Brisbane-Gold Coast corridor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) is in the House and I know that he would join with me in hoping that the Commonwealth funding of the Gold Coast <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>railway may leave some scope in the hands of the State Government to proceed with the long awaited rail to Redcliffe. That services parts of both my electorate and my colleague's electorate. It has been promised now for about 100 hundred years; it has been trotted out at every State election for the last hundred years. With Commonwealth funding of the Gold Coast rail link, there may be some hope that the work necessary to bring forward the Redcliffe rail link can be put firmly on the State Government's agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been, indeed, some positive changes in terms of forward planning in my own electorate in recent times. For instance, after much lobbying by local residents and me, the Department of Social Security has agreed that the Pine Rivers Shire needs its own Social Security office. This office will be opening a bit later this year and will overcome the intolerable situation that has existed for many years of residents from the Pine Rivers Shire having to travel quite a considerable distance into Brisbane in order to lodge forms or seek advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of child-care, the region is beginning to receive recognition of its high needs. In fact, it will be my pleasure next week to host a visit to my electorate, to the Pine Rivers area, by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and he will be meeting with the Pine Rivers Shire Council to discuss this very issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some encouraging examples of closer cooperation between administrations. The Brisbane City Council and the Pine Rivers Shire Council, for example, have conducted a trial bus program designed to provide better transport links between the two local authority areas, recognising that Brisbane simply does not end at the boundary of the Brisbane City Council and that Brisbane is a broader concept taking in the neighbouring local government areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of housing, there has been some encouraging acceptance of the idea of the green street concept in the suburb of Strathpine in my electorate. Some 400 townhouses have recently been constructed according to these principles. These townhouses are close to shops, schools, transport and entertainment. They are ideal for retirees, young couples and sole parents. The estate's design cuts down on noise and traffic. There are no through roads and there are pockets of green areas throughout. So far, more than 250 townhouses have been sold at an average price of $89,000, which is a very significant step in making housing more affordable in this part of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak today about the problems of urban sprawl and I hope that the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) may take some interest. I think there is common agreement that Australian urban areas, where some 80 per cent of Australians live, are in a state of social, environmental and economic stress. Over the last 30 years there has been an ever increasing number of seminars, reports and conferences on the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main solution to these problems has been seen as stopping the sprawl of cities by increasing residential densities. This policy of urban consolidation has received the enthusiastic support of academics, bureaucrats, architects, planners, the development industry and, inevitably, State and now Federal Government. Yet in the same period cities have sprawled at a greater rate than ever before, residential densities have fallen and public resistance to higher densities has increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social and economic conditions of our major urban areas are deteriorating and it appears we are headed inexorably down the nightmarish urban track of American cities. We were supposed to know the problems and solutions, so what went wrong? Perhaps we should have taken notice of Jane Jacobs, who in her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Life and Death of Great American Cities</EMPHASIS> wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pseudo science of city planning and its companion the art of city design have not yet broken with the specious comfort of wishes, familiar superstition, oversimplifications, symbols, and have not yet embarked on the adventure of probing the real world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Years of learning and a plethora of complicated dogma have arisen on a foundation of nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally in time, forceful and able men, admired administrators, having swallowed the initial fallacies. . . go on to the greatest destructive excesses which prudence or mercy might previously have forbade.</PARA>
<PARA>Hence, today we have the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with his visiting professor irrelevancies about `elegant, medium density human-scale architecture on consolidated multiple blocks'. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) chants an endless mantra about the evils of single dwelling houses. In New South Wales, Greiner has his `vision of a high-density city'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not much good blaming public opposition or local government, which has largely turned feral on urban consolidation in the last decade. There are no great gains to be made in abuse of nimbys or calling for administrators for councils or fantasies that some bold, new urban development resource security Bill could be rammed through State or Federal Parliament to solve the problems. That has been tried many times before, without much effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our political systems are in about the same shape as our cities, there is still some democracy every two or three years; and elitism and authoritarianism have not and do not work. Elections can be and have been won or lost on urban policy. We have to re-examine the conventional wisdom of urban consolidation and its associated mythology and address the real causes of sprawl and deterioration of cities. Ridicule and exaggeration of the great Australian dream and its quarter-acre blocks is, quite frankly, asinine. Single dwelling house lots in the major Australian cities range from one-thirtieth of an acre to an average of one-eighth of an acre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great Australian dream is not peculiarly Australian; it is inherent in human beings. Since the world began, irrespective of race, religion or status, given a free choice, everyone has wanted more space. While it is true that a substantial number of people will accept higher density living and smaller space needs at various times, they know that low rise separate dwellings mean more freedom, greater self-expression, more privacy and a better and more flexible living environment. They fear that increased densities will add to the worst problem of cities&mdash;traffic, more congestion, pollution, accidents, pedestrian danger, environmental breakdown and parking difficulties. They fear a threat to their major investment&mdash;their home&mdash;and many of these fears are justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are constantly told how far we have slipped down the per capita GDP list but, with all the faults, we still have the world's best urban living conditions. While the public may put up with the short term asset stripping, divisive, survival of the fittest approach characterising State and Federal governments in recent years, they will not put up with governments which attack them in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The myth that high densities produce cheaper, affordable housing, and that Australia has too much investment in housing, is a constant refrain. The facts are that single dwellings are the cheapest form of dwelling. Building costs per square metre rise almost directly with density. Space required per person also rises as density of housing forms increases. So if you want to virtually double the cost of housing per person, and the nation's total investment in housing, moving the population into flats is the way to go. Another example of the failure of the urban consolidation theory is what I call the `reverse cargo cult' myth&mdash;the idea that our predecessors built all this infrastructure in the inner cities with unused capacity, which lasts forever, just waiting for us to use. Not only is the spare capacity theory dubious, there is no sound evidence that creating new infrastructure is more expensive than renewing antiquated existing infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, urban renewal alters social structure and infrastructure requirements. For example, child population falls, schools close and are replaced in much more expensive form, consuming greater land areas, elsewhere in the city. The notion that housing density alone has anything to do with urban sprawl is at the heart of the urban consolidation failure. Housing occupies only about 30 per cent of total urban areas. Even a theoretical doubling of density on that 30 per cent would save only 15 per cent of the area of the city as a whole. However, if this were achieved, land use needs are created for many other needs such as roads, open space, car parks, businesses and child-care. The expansion of these other uses means that not only is the 15 per cent theoretical saving used up but the remaining residential component is reduced and the population falls. That is the story of Australian cities since the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Net residential densities have increased dramatically as many thousands of flats have been built but gross residential densities have fallen. What has been happening is that we have been building more and more on less and less, reducing population, increasing housing costs and total housing investment, and not worrying about the constantly expanding 70 per cent of other land uses, and the inevitable corollary of change and redevelopment&mdash;wasted idle land. It is this 70 per cent of the total city consisting of the non-residential land uses where the god of urban sprawl really resides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure of urban consolidation over the last 30 years is a result of these myths: that urban consolidation can be achieved by elitist and bureaucratic values imposed without public support, that higher densities can produce cheap and affordable housing, that there is a great economic advantage in utilising existing infrastructure rather than building new and that housing density has anything to do with the size of cities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to deliver a speech today about a great old friend mine, a chap called Jack Devereux, a former president of the Metalworkers Union. Jack was a social justice expert long before social justice become the buzzword of this era. I would not be able to give Jack the credit he deserves in the time I have left here this afternoon, mainly because someone called a quorum&mdash;which was a disgrace.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jack Devereux certainly believed in social justice and so do we on this side of the House.

The honourable member for Gippsland is trying to tell us that 15 per cent on all essentials in life, on bread and butter and all those sorts of things, will not make them cost 15 per cent more. Honourable members opposite have the audacity to claim that the new tax is not going to affect farmers, is not going to affect business. What about all the small business people? Small business will be devastated under the Opposition's package because they are the guys who are going to have to work on Sundays&mdash;most of them already work Saturdays. On Sundays, when they might have had a little bit of time with their families, they are going to be sitting down doing tax returns to comply with the requirements on these ridiculous GST proposals. It is the craziest thing that this country has ever seen. </PARA>

One of my constituents actually suggested to me one day that the coalition would take us back to the sixteenth century. The Opposition's proposal would mean running around collecting taxes from everybody and taxing people out of getting the real necessities. What a disgrace it is.

As the Prime Minister will be aware, in his One Nation statement he indicated that any surplus from the sale of wool from the stockpile by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission would be refunded to those who had paid the 12 per cent wool tax this season. This was confirmed by the Treasurer in answer to a question last Thursday. However, it has been reported that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is now favouring the position of the coalition and the wool industry at large: to reduce the tax to 10 per cent or below this coming season and not proceed with the cash rebate refund arrangement that he had announced previously.

That was an approach which the industry made to us and to which we responded positively. I might add that the other advantage of that is that it will protect wool growers in falling markets from forced AWRC selling activities. In this regard, legislation will be introduced into the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the surplus funds are concerned, the One Nation statement did indicate that any surplus funds not prudently required by the Realisation Commission may be used as a rebate to wool growers in the form of a cash payment. The commitment was also given by the Government that I would consult with the wool industry on the distribution of such funds to growers. The Government's intention was to establish a process which would allow growers to benefit directly from the improved performance of the Realisation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate response from the Wool Council, as it was from the Opposition, was to criticise this proposal without looking at what the words really said and to call for a reduction in the wool tax rate. As I have indicated before, the Government is not prepared to reduce the wool tax at this stage. We cannot make the judgment based on one year's performance in the course of a seven-year debt reduction schedule. It simply is not enough time to justify at this stage a reduction in the prescribed rate of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I can advise the House today that following consultations with the Wool Council I have obtained Cabinet endorsement to provide for further flexibility in the distribution of surplus funds from the Realisation Commission. Therefore, I propose to use any surplus funds this year as a rebate against the wool tax. This will enable an effective reduction in the rate of tax whilst maintaining the prescribed rate of tax at the existing 12 per cent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has succeeded in breaking the back of inflation after two decades from the double-digit inflation bequeathed to us by the Opposition to a statistical rate now of 1 1/2 per cent and an underlying rate of about 3 per cent. Of course, honourable members opposite are always terribly embarrassed that they found they were incapable of dealing with inflation, and terribly embarrassed about the fact that this Government has been able not only to deal with it but to deal with it decisively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim must be to maintain that inflation gain in the 1990s by keeping inflation structurally low. This, of course, would be put at risk by taxes upon consumption that drifted back into the wages system. We have had some debate in the House over the last week about the impact of a goods and services tax at 15 per cent upon the cost of living of Australian men and women, taxpayers, families, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have found that the Opposition has been relying on a so-called Foodlink consumption tax survey. I will just make a couple of simple points about it. The first survey was produced by Foodlink on 10 June 1991; on 11 July 1991 the GST campaign group, headed by Senator Baume, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer and others, produced a press statement, `Labor's hidden consumption tax exposed', in which they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basket of groceries annihilated this week by revelations from a Queensland supermarket group that Labor's scare campaign over how much the basket of groceries would cost with the GST has been annihilated by the revelations of this group.</PARA>
<PARA>That came out a few weeks later. Then on 20 November 1991 the second survey from Foodlink came out&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;one day before the presentation of the GST package on 21 November. In that survey we found that there had been a change in the basis of the survey. Added into the second basket were all goods with a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax penalty:  Ajax Spray and Wipe, 20 per cent;  Harpic toilet cleanser, 20 per cent; Snow White bleach; three extra cans of Pal; three extra cans of Whiskers; two extra rolls of toilet paper; four extra soap bars.</PARA>

In other words, we saw a vast change between the goods in the first and second surveys. The composition of the sample was dramatically changed between the first and the second surveys and it was produced one day before the GST package was presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then on 9 December 1991 the Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement&mdash;again in his usual extravagant language: `Another Labor lie exposed'&mdash;and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A price survey by the independent Queensland supermarket group, Foodlink, shows on their estimate that the impact of the goods and services tax on a representative shopping basket of groceries is 4.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the questions are:  who made it representative?  Who decided what would be in the basket?  Was the public not entitled to believe that a representative basket of groceries included food?  Of course it was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the Leader of the Opposition, stung by criticism in the House, put out another statement, again verbose, with language such as `breathtaking fraud', `based on a lie', `shamelessly misrepresented'&mdash;the usual stuff.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Foodlink basket was never distorted or represented by me to be anything other than what it was;</PARA>
<PARA>But he said that it was a representative basket of groceries. Therefore, most Australians took that to mean that it included food. Then we found that yesterday Foodlink Ltd said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no time was it stated by Foodlink that this was a total of food purchased for a family for two weeks. . . . At no stage did we say this was representative of a `food basket'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will leave it to the public to judge. This survey came out. Then the Opposition came out with its campaign group press release a couple of weeks later. Then, on the day before the GST package came out, there was a new tax link survey with the composition of it changed. Then the next day the GST arrived. Then we found that the items that were taken out of the survey were those which materially affected it. Then we found that the wholesale sales tax calculation had been levied at the retail level whereas, if it were levied at the wholesale level, the base would shrink;  therefore, the size of the price impact would be greater. So the 4.8 per cent is actually 7 per cent. Even on your own figures&mdash;</PARA>

What would have been the implications of reducing public expenditure when the Australian economy is just starting to emerge from recession?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1726" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Fraser, the increase in expenditure in the One Nation package, which was principally in the area of infrastructure and assistance to families, was designed to try to ensure that the recovery which is gradually taking place was made stronger and more vigorous, and that we move more quickly back into the kind of growth which will give us substantial increases in employment and reductions in unemployment. But in doing that the Government is not abandoning its approach to the public sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our period in office we have been seeking to ensure that the public sector was made much more efficient and that the overall size of the public sector was reduced. We have been quite successful in that respect. When we came into office, public sector outlays as a percentage of GDP were about 29 per cent. These outlays were reduced to 23 1/2 per cent by 1989-90 by a whole series of measures that we took, including targeting programs to make sure that they were more effectively targeted to those in need. Some of these programs were opposed by the Opposition, such as the assets test on pensions. With the recession, outlays as a percentage of GDP have gone back up to over 26 per cent. Structurally we have a public sector which is much less than that which was inherited from the Fraser Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition in the Fightback statement, instead of boosting the public sector in the way I have described, would have taken the opposite approach. As we know from the Opposition's Fightback package, if it had been introducing its package it would have been cutting the public sector. The Opposition claims that its gross expenditure cuts would be $10.1 billion over three years with net expenditure cuts of $4 1/2 billion. When properly costed by my Department, that comes to gross cuts of $7.6 billion and a net cut of $1.9 billion. The figures are different but still in the same direction; there are still substantial cuts in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not support that kind of approach because it would have been quite the opposite of what the economy needs at present; it would have pushed us further into contraction rather than recovery; and it would have a devastating effect on people currently being assisted by the programs involved. If we look at the proposals to cut expenditure, we see that they are, indeed, crude and callous. The nature of that is perhaps reflected in comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition recently in a speech in Brisbane. When talking about the public sector and the need to reduce it, he said, `The trouble with bureaucrats is they don't eat their young'. In relation to government programs, he said that the Government should be prepared to just chop them off at the knees.</PARA>

It will wipe out all of the job subsidy programs and bring in Austrain or `Aus-slave', in which people work for 20 per cent less than the award rate. So those involved in our job subsidy programs will certainly be cut off at the knees. The Opposition will increase the waiting period for Job Search allowance and sickness allowance from one week to three weeks effectively, making it a five week wait.</PARA>

On your assertion that the length of an answer is not something that you can deal with, can I direct your attention to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 29 August 1989, which was, in fact, the first day on which you were Speaker, when you asked the then Minister for Arts to bring his answer to a close? I ask you, Mr Speaker, for my benefit&mdash;as you pointed out, I am a new member of this Parliament&mdash;which ruling was right?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might just say two things to the honourable member for Menzies. Firstly, he might listen. If he had, he would have heard me ask the Minister to draw his answer to a close. But as the honourable member wants a bit of elucidation, I might say to him what Speaker Snedden&mdash;who seems to be drawn to my attention frequently by members of the Opposition&mdash;said on 27 October 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have indicated before, and I repeat&mdash;although it should not be necessary&mdash;that I posses no power to require the Prime Minister to end an answer. Indeed, although I am reluctant to admit it, I have no power to order any Minister to end an answer.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the point that was made by Speaker Snedden. I might also add, to help the honourable member for Menzies, that on a number of occasions in the past members have placed notices of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> about setting time limits on answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the right honourable member for New England would remember that in 1978 the then honourable member for Oxley, Mr Hayden, placed a notice on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and that it lapsed at the end of the session. I am sure other honourable members will recall that in 1983 the honourable member for Dawson placed a notice of motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and that it also lapsed. Neither of those motions were dealt with. It would seem that, by not dealing with those motions, the House has set itself against setting time limits. Unless the House sets time limits, and unless Speaker Jenkins, Speaker Child and Speaker Snedden were all wrong, the House and my predecessors have made it quite clear that a Speaker has no ability to put arbitrary and subjective time limits on the answers to questions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members obviously do not want to hear about their candidate for Wills, because his comment in a letter to the Prime Minister that he wants to cut social welfare payments by 30 per cent is a horrendous position to hold. As the Minister for Social Security said in this House the other day, it would mean a cut in the Job Search allowance of $84 a fortnight, or a cut in family allowance on average by $6 a child a fortnight and a cut in family allowance supplement payments of $18 to $25 a fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a fundamental point that needs to be understood about the GST debate. Before the honourable member for Mayo was suspended from the House, he claimed it would have a $20 billion benefit for business. The GST raises $27 billion; if $20 billion of it goes to business, it means that the Treasury assumption that it is all passed through to lower prices invalidates the 3.6 per cent. You cannot put $20 billion into business by reducing payroll tax but let them keep it, have it paid for by the GST and still have a 3.6 per cent CPI.</PARA></TALK.START>

But, if it is not all passed through to lower prices&mdash;if business hangs on to the $20 billion&mdash;we would be back to double digit inflation. Again, duplicity and dishonesty in the claims by the Opposition!

Treasury has done the decent thing and presumed every cent of it is passed on to produce the 3.6 per cent. We know that even under ideal conditions not every cent would be passed on; that the 3.6 per cent is a myth. The Opposition is now claiming that there is a $20 billion bonus for business&mdash;but the GST raises only $27 billion. So, if it is a 15 per cent tax on all goods as a final tax to raise $27 billion, but $20 billion of the $27 billion is transferred to business, I leave it to you to make the CPI estimates&mdash;but they must be double digit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is this: there are about 800,000 small businesses in Australia, and at the moment there are about 70,000 wholesale sales tax payers, so already very few small businesses are included amongst those who are wholesale sales tax payers. Of the 70,000, we have now provided an opportunity for the exemption of 54,000, or 77 per cent. In other words, there will now be fewer than 20,000 wholesale sales tax payers out of 800,000 small businesses and, of course, more than that in terms of businesses as a whole. This means a dramatic reduction in the administrative load that the wholesale sales tax imposes upon business, and particularly small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Goldstein says that I should relate the answer to other countries. Of course, the whole point about the Opposition proposals is that they are not unique or original. They have been picked up and cobbled together from the experiences of various other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the honourable member for Goldstein invites me to do so, I might just make a comment on the British system, the value added tax, and the cost of compliance to small business as a result of that tax. A study by Professor Sandford says that the cost in Britain for small business&mdash;the cost of compliance, not paying the VAT&mdash;is #7.80 for each 1,000 pounds of goods sold, whereas for large business it is only 3p per #1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is an enormous imposition in administration costs, the compliance cost for small business. This is a compliance task, an objective which the Opposition now has for every business in Australia large and small, but it will impact differentially and more excessively on smaller business in the same way as it does in Britain, as evidenced by the study by Professor Sandford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen exactly the same evidence coming out of Canada, another country which members of the Opposition have decided to exemplify. They boasted that a tax official from Canada came out here to tell them how to do it, and there are studies showing what an enormous impact it is having on business in Canada. Similarly in New Zealand, another country which they are trying to exemplify in more ways than one, accountants are advising businesses in Australia that they should pick up the idea of a consumption tax in Australia only if they want to abolish their Sunday leisure time, because it will take all their Sundays and not a few dollars in order to comply with the provisions of the Opposition's proposed consumption tax.</PARA>

I will refer to one observation that he made on 11 February this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has very limited power in this Parliament to encourage you to take a sense of balance in the proceedings of this House. The only standing order that relates to answers is standing order 145 on the issue of relevance. That is the only way in which we can urge you to try to exert some balance in this Parliament and to pull a Government Minister into line when that person is absolutely flouting the procedures of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet consistently, almost without exception, you have allowed Ministers to ramble on for whatever length of time they have wanted to take and to make policy announcements when they should be doing so by way of ministerial statement. Yet, on every occasion when we on this side of the House try to stand up to take a point of order under standing order 145 on relevance, you have not even let us finish the point of order. I do not know how you can do it. I have no idea how you can conclude what our point of order will be before you have heard it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been a characteristic of your performance in recent days. That is a part of the disgrace that we are debating today:  the fact that you draw conclusions about what we are trying to do in terms of raising a point of order before you have even bothered to listen. You snarl and yell; you break up the debate; you single us out, if you like, for disrupting Parliament. In the same week as you did that, for example, you allowed the Prime Minister to stand up and do bird calls in this House. If that is not disrupting Parliament, I do not know what is. The fact is, Mr Speaker, that you have consistently failed in your duty to provide a fair go for both sides of this Parliament in the conduct of the daily proceedings of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to step back and ask ourselves why this Speaker behaves the way he does. We work on the principle that the Speaker takes on a responsibility to be independent and objective. When we look into the reasons why, we find that they have nothing to do with the interests of Australia but have to do with the interests of a couple of mates, the mateship between you and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you can probably remember back to 1986 when there was an incident in this House and the Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, had you down to his office and&mdash;I forget the press description&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bounced you around the walls&mdash;I think that is probably the way it was described&mdash;because you had not offered him sufficient protection in this Parliament. I have never seen anybody offered the extent of protection you offer this Prime Minister. He stands up here on a daily basis and flouts every conceivable sense of propriety in this Parliament, and you allow him to get away with it. Indeed, he dictates to you how you should conduct this House. You see the nod, you see the wink, you see the twitch, you see the direct instructions&mdash;things like, `It is a frivolous point of order; name him', and all this sort of thing, coming from the Prime Minister to you on a regular basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sat here and noticed how on many occasions you have sat there and waited until you received that instruction before you moved in relation to this side of the Parliament. This has been a consistent feature of your performance, and it has heightened in the last few weeks as the pressure in Wills has built up and the uncertainty of your personal preselection has come to a head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has become&mdash;what were the words used yesterday?&mdash;subject to violent mood swings, of course under the pressure of what is happening in Wills, and you, Mr Speaker, have started to feel the real pressure concerning your preselection and the fact that the Left has control of the seat of Grayndler and you are about to be a lame duck Speaker. Today I am giving the Left a very real opportunity not to wait for preselection. The members of the Left can express their point today in support of getting rid of this man by voting with us on this motion of no confidence in the Speaker. I ask them to think seriously about that. It is a unique opportunity that they can take to express a view. I know that there are some very sensible, measured and honest people on the other side of this Parliament, and I know that they too have been totally offended by the behaviour of this man in the course of the last few months as Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return, though, to the mateship. It is the mateship with the New South Wales Right that has taken control of this Parliament.

As we have gone out of our way in recent days to establish, you will say or do anything, you will distort or misrepresent anything, you will bend any principle&mdash;it does not matter what it takes&mdash;in order to save your own political hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now, when your own political hide is at risk and you desperately need the support of the Prime Minister and the other members of the New South Wales Right, you have blatantly and overtly bowed in favour of the Government in all your rulings in the course of the conduct of this Parliament, to the point where the Parliament is no more than a total shambles and an embarrassment to the people of Australia, who sit back and watch the televised proceedings of the Parliament every night and cannot understand how, in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years, with one million people unemployed, you have no interest in those issues. The Government has no interest in those issues; you have no interest in ensuring that Ministers answer questions about those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the standing of both sides of this Parliament has been called into disrespect in the eyes of the Australian people&mdash;and a substantial part of the responsibility for that goes right to you. You are the one who has the unique position, despite the extent to which you try from time to time to hide behind Standing Orders, and the power to actually make the rulings you want to make in the interpretation of Standing Orders to maintain control of this Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cannot expect it. Indeed, Derek Parker in an article written in February 1989, when you were just Chairman of Committees, focused on the deterioration of Question Time, which has gone downhill steadily since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the House that even Speaker Joan Child on 12 February 1986 had the courage to say to the then Prime Minister during an extensive answer, `The Prime Minister is now curtailing his answer'. Then she went on and said, `The Prime Minister will now finish his answer'. That is what Speaker Child had the courage to do in her lonely work as the first female Speaker of this Parliament. That is something you have never had the courage to do, Mr Speaker, and on which you stand found guilty for your conduct in conducting Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a steady decline in the number of questions, until even the Government's sensitivities were offended. You might remember that under Prime Minister Hawke we suddenly had the necessity to adopt an arrangement where Question Time went longer than 45 minutes and we on this side of the House would be given seven questions, no matter how long it took. But even that operation, even that convention, even that understanding, has now gone by the board as a direct consequence of Prime Minister Keating. It is down to two, three or four questions for every three-quarters of an hour. It is not our fault. We get just 30 seconds, at best 60 seconds, to put the question. We then get irrelevant replies that go for five or 10 minutes and that you, Mr Speaker, allow to continue in a way which is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to points of order, our one opportunity to raise matters properly and fairly in terms of your conduct of the House and to assist you to make rulings and take a stand in the interests of parliamentary democracy and fairness of play. What do we have in respect of points of order? You do not hear out the presentation of the point of order. We saw an example of that today when you chopped off members in presenting points of order, including the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Quite often you do not even bother to rule on them, but just call the Minister back to the dispatch box. Worse still, when you do rule and say the point of order is not sustained, you rarely give a reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 22 years I have served under a number of Speakers, both in the ultimate bear pit&mdash;the New South Wales Legislative Assembly&mdash;and in the Federal Parliament since 1984. Never have I seen a Speaker as bad as this Speaker. Never have I seen a Speaker so rarely get to his feet when the situation requires that he get to his feet and command respect for the office of Speaker, which has to be granted. Why? Because he likes to let it flow, as he admitted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He lets it flow one way, unfairly, unjustifiably, totally towards the Government and stacked against the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that this is not the centre of the MCG, the SCG, the WACA or the Gabba; it is the centre of parliamentary democracy in Australia. But time after time you give biased rulings on points of order without even listening to the whole structure and presentation that honourable members seek to make on their points of order. You have failed in these custodial duties and in the maintenance of these conventions, written and unwritten, which are the cement, if you like, or the glue, which provides cohesion to the working of parliamentary democracy and which you, Mr Speaker, have wrecked in terms of the conduct of this Parliament. Let me turn to the suspension of members. I sought information, quite properly, from the Acting Clerk, and I received a letter dated 27 November 1991. It says:</PARA>

<PARA>and up till that point in time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr McLeay has named eight members who have been suspended.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me ask those present in the gallery how fair they might think this is: seven of them were in fact from the coalition and just one was from the Government. That is not a bad ratio. This year we have had another two from our side of the House, so the ratio is nine on this side sent to the sin bin and further and just one on the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there would be an absolute riot at the SCG or the Sydney football ground if there were rulings from a referee in that ratio. It is not acceptable for the Leader of the Government to mutter under his breath about this and to argue that the reason it is so lopsided is that we are misbehaving more. That is absolute garbage.

I understand that there has been a bevy of notes flowing between the Chair and the Minister even in the course of this particular debate. Let me simply say, Mr Speaker, that you not only have to be fair but have to be seen to be fair with regard to the conduct of the Chair, and you have repeatedly failed to be seen to be fair in terms of the body language directions which have flowed from the front bench, in terms of the other directions which have been meted out to you in your own office, as we have read and as has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in relation to your whole conduct as Speaker of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to the House and say to you that you have failed in your duties as custodian of the rights and privileges of all members of the Parliament.

I understand that this is occupying your mind a great deal at this time as the matter of pre-selection is dealt with, but I have to say to you also that that does not extend to your actions and to your conduct in the chair of this House. That, sir, charges you with responsibilities which have been developed over centuries, which have been developed in Australia since 1901 and which require of you absolute fairness, not only in terms of your direct deliberations, your direct determinations on the floor of the House, but also in terms of the upholding of all the conventions which apply to the conduct of the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say further, Mr Speaker, that I acknowledge the fact that you have put a great deal of effort into aspects of the Speaker's office.

The question is: how do you handle the conduct of the House and maintain the freedom, rights and privileges of honourable members on both sides of the House? That is where you have failed. You have failed to stand up to the Ministers; you have failed in the conduct of Question Time; you have failed in the handling of points of orders; and you have failed in the handling of suspensions.

In fact, he is wrong when he says that three people are responsible for the conduct of this House. Some 147 people are responsible for the conduct of this House, and some 146 owe respect to the Chair.

More recently&mdash;and I suspect this is where this motion stems from&mdash;the Opposition front bench has been a little reluctant to engage in those sorts of tactics, and the tactics have been engaged in by members of the back bench who have been frustrated by the inability of their leaders to get a point across in Question Time, or any other time, and been worried increasingly by the implications of where their policies are taking them. They have started to be utterly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party in this place said, `Mr Speaker, you do not rise to your feet often enough'. If that is a criticism of the Speaker, he might like to take it on board. But the Leader of the National Party has a very short memory. Yesterday the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was allowed a holiday from this chamber for 24 hours. Why was he allowed that holiday? Because he persisted in standing while the Speaker was standing. Having been warned by the Speaker to take his seat, he failed to uphold the Speaker's position on that occasion when he was conducting a practice which the Leader of the National Party demanded he undertake. The Leader of the National Party voted against the Speaker on that matter. That is another manifestation of the hypocrisy of the Opposition when it comes to debating this matter in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, the problem of the Opposition is ignorance. Those opposite do not understand that in the parliamentary process we do not go through endless debates and discussions on points of order in Question Time. That is simply not done. Furthermore, the Opposition does not understand the withdrawal process itself. Any member may take offence at any matter that is directed at himself but, if a third person takes offence from that interchange, the words used must be unparliamentary to allow that third person to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, great umbrage was taken at the Speaker because he allegedly failed to call upon the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to withdraw the expression `cheat'. Where has `cheat' been used recently? The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What absolute nonsense! Government members lie and cheat.</PARA>
<PARA>Was he asked to withdraw `cheat'? No, he was not. The Leader of the Opposition said this about the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . he will lie, he will cheat, he will misrepresent. . . </PARA>
<PARA>What was he required to withdraw? `He will lie'. Opposition members are utterly in ignorance of parliamentary procedure in this place. In their ignorance lies their multiplicity of acts of disturbance of the good conduct of the business of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion, conceived in hypocrisy, manufactured in ignorance, is a disgusting piece of work by the Leader of the Opposition in this place, who has been disgustingly hypocritical when it comes to dealing with decent Standing Orders in this place. Opposition members are contemptible people, and the House will now reject their contemptible motion. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Barton)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following reports: report No. 314 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eighth Performance Audits</EMPHASIS> and report No. 315 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social responsibilities of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises.</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make some brief comments in relation to the two reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts as outlined. I will deal, firstly, with report No. 314 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Eighth Performance Audits</EMPHASIS>. Under the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, the Committee is required to examine all reports of the Auditor-General, including reports of efficiency audits. In report No. 314 the Committee examines eight reports of the Auditor-General covering the period from May to November 1990. These Auditor-General's reports cover a variety of programs and departments, including the Department of Veterans' Affairs; the Department of Employment, Education and Training; the Department of Community Services and Health; and the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departmental responses to the Auditor-General's recommendations are as follows. The responses by departments to the audit reports and recommendations were encouraging, with most of the recommendations being accepted by the auditees. Only two matters are highlighted in the Committee's report as needing further attention, and both relate to the use of internal audit by government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee notes that a major activity currently being undertaken by the Australian National Audit Office is the survey of internal audit in the Commonwealth public sector. The Auditor-General has reported on stage 1 of the survey, with the second and final report expected in June this year. The survey found that 70 per cent of Commonwealth departments and agencies had internal audit units and that, overall, internal audit activity resulted in improved efficiency within departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers that internal audit activity is critical to the efficiency of a department and its accountability to parliament and has recommended in this report that new financial administration legislation requires that all Commonwealth organisations establish an effective internal audit function. Another recommendation relates to the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to strengthen its internal audit activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts plays an important role in stimulating efficient and effective use of public moneys through its scrutiny of Auditor-General's reports and departmental responses to his recommendations. The Committee believes that systematic follow-up of performance audits by the Audit Office is an essential adjunct to the Committee's scrutiny of performance audit reports. The Committee, in its report No. 296, made it clear that the Auditor-General should accept responsibility for the follow-up of his recommendations. The Audit Office has accepted that recommendation, as has the Government, by providing additional funds to the Audit Office for efficiency audits. The Committee notes, with approval, that the Audit Office has embarked on a program of follow-up audits, conducting four in 1991 and planning a further six in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to comment on the Committee's 315th report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Social Responsibilities of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities and Government Business Enterprises</EMPHASIS>. This report is the result of the Committee's investigation of how statutory authorities and government business enterprises, known as GBEs, measure and report to the public and the Parliament on the performance of their social responsibilities. The report also records the Committee's conclusion that most government agencies still have some way to go before they perfect the use of performance measures and recommends ways in which this might be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social responsibilities are defined in terms of the responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their clients, their employees and the environment. Their responsibilities towards their clients include making their services as accessible as possible, having means available by which clients can provide input to the operations of statutory authorities and freedom of information. The social responsibilities of statutory authorities and GBEs towards their employees include: equal employment opportunity; occupational health and safety; training; and industrial democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these responsibilities are imposed on statutory authorities, while others are undertaken by them on a voluntary basis. Whether they are legally required or voluntarily assumed, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts believes that the nation's statutory authorities and GBEs should act in accordance with the highest possible standards. The Committee recognises that there may be pressures on commercially oriented agencies to concentrate on their commercial performance at the expense of their social responsibilities. It is essential, however, that this not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the government organisations act in a socially responsible manner and can demonstrate this to the public and the Parliament, the Committee is, firstly, recommending that social objectives be included amongst the corporate objectives of these organisations and, secondly, that progress in meeting all these objectives be reported in annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that, in making their reports, whether annual reports to the Parliament or reports for other purposes, statutory authorities and GBEs should: compare performance with a standard or target; focus on outcomes; use several indicators for each program, retaining the same indicators over a number of years so that changes over time can be monitored; choose information to suit the needs of the user; and use both qualitative and quantitative information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recognising that there are limitations on the use of performance information, the Committee believes that agencies should strive for the best possible performance information and develop expertise amongst their staff in the development and use of the performance information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's report provides detailed recommendations about the nature of the information that should be reported in relation to EEO, training, access to services, activities that impact on the environment, and the activities of consultative groups, including those of statutory marketing authorities. A social responsibility summary is advocated by the Committee as a means by which each organisation can outline its progress and achievements in the performance of its social responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Requiring an organisation to define its social objectives and measure and report on its performance focuses the organisation's attention on its social responsibilities. If its reports are scrutinised and regular response provided, the pressure on the organisation to observe its social responsibilities will be enhanced. Scrutiny of and providing response to its reports are therefore of the utmost importance, whether they are provided by Ministers, the Parliament&mdash;especially the committees of this House&mdash;review bodies or the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also considered the means by which values could be attached to social responsibilities. Needless to say, this was a difficult task. The value of social responsibilities may be financial or non-financial; they are of value to individuals, the organisation providing them and the wider community, but their impact cannot always be fully assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the information received by the Committee about the value of social responsibilities concerned the cost of providing them, particularly the cost of providing community service obligations, such as telephone and mail services to remote and isolated areas of the country. How the costing should be carried out has been determined by the Government in relation to Telecom's provision of telephone services. The method of least avoidable cost is to be used and it is expected that other GBEs will use the same method. The Committee noted the criticism that has been expressed about the validity of estimates of community service obligation costs; and, accordingly, we recommend that the way in which estimates are made should be monitored and improvements sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the more general level of dealing with the values and costs of socially responsible behaviour, the Committee endorses the use of cost-benefit analyses. Such analyses should consider both the quantifiable and qualitative aspects of any proposal and take as wide a view as possible of the impact of the proposal on the community and the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and GBEs is important and I suspect in time will prove to be one of great significance. Both this report and report 314, which reviews eight of the Auditor-General's performance audits, focus on increasing the accountability of government agencies to the Parliament. I commend both reports to the House. In closing, I would like to thank all members of the Committee and the staff, who have always worked tirelessly, and on this occasion, of course, particularly Dr Sarah Hnatiuk for her work on the social responsibilities report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody will stand as the monumental work to date in examining the position of Aboriginal Australians within the broader Australian society. I have no doubt that in years to come it will be looked upon as a watershed, although exactly why remains to be seen. I hope it will be looked upon as the time that Australia took the opportunity to form a partnership for the advancement of Aboriginal people. It is quite possible that it will be looked upon as a lost opportunity and show us as a nation too immature to put aside petty differences in order to achieve something of real benefit to the whole country. I hope my speech today goes some way towards creating a situation in which this report proves to be the catalyst for re-examining where we are today in Aboriginal affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one reads the report, one cannot help being hit with a whole variety of emotions&mdash;anger, sadness, joy&mdash;and no doubt these are the emotions that the commissioners themselves experienced in writing the report. It is a frank and honest assessment of the attitudes of Aboriginal Australia, the position that Aboriginals occupy in our society and the attitudes of the broader Australian community. It is also a fairly frank examination of our past and why we are where we are today. It does not seek to instil guilt or apportion blame, but merely, in some cases coldly and clinically, dissects the facts and lays them bare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In understanding some of the difficulties we face today, the words of Commissioner Johnston, better than anybody else, explain his reaction after having spent several years of his life listening and talking to Aboriginal people. He states in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say very frankly that when I started upon my work in this commission, I had some knowledge of the way broad policy had evolved to the detriment of Aboriginal people and some idea of the consequences. But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material which has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis. It's hard to convey the understanding, because each particular story takes time and space to tell.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk of two such cases. The first was a letter that came from a protector of Aborigines in Queensland who was shocked to receive a request from a newly married Aboriginal woman to have from her bank account, which he controlled, four-fifths of her week's earnings. This was despite the fact that he acknowledged that her employer, who was going to do the shopping, would be very careful with the disbursement of her money. He refused the request but, as it was Christmas, allowed her a bit of her own money to buy lollies with, for which she had not asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case into which Commissioner Johnston inquired was that of a young boy who had been put into an institution because he kept running away from home, where there had been a lot of domestic strife. He wanted to go to the home of his sister, a married woman who lived on a reserve. The sister and her husband are to this day leading members of the community. The superintendent refused the lad permission to come onto the reserve to join his sister. His reasons included that the couple were thought to keep some beer in the refrigerator at a time when it was lawful to do so, and they had some household items on hire purchase, including a TV. Commissioner Johnston goes on in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petty tyranny, escalating to interference with the most fundamental of rights to practise one's own culture, one's own religion with one's own children is deeply resented.</PARA>
<PARA>Some years ago there was significant violence in the Kempsey area of New South Wales. The local council commissioned a report from a clinical psychologist into the basis of the violence and the racial tensions in the area. This report is illuminating reading. It states that the single most important factor in the poor race relations in the Kempsey area was the bitterness that Aboriginal people felt. It was not bitterness for what happened 150 years ago or 100 years ago; it was bitterness for what has happened in recent living memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I became the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I had no conception of what had happened in recent memory. I started to look. I found that in New South Wales until 1964 an Aboriginal child could be actively excluded from school on the basis of race; in the Northern Territory until 1965 Aboriginal people needed permission to marry; in Western Australia until 1968 Aboriginal children were still being forcibly removed from their parents against the will of the parents; and in Queensland until the mid-1960s Aborigines had to carry what was in effect a passport if they wanted to leave a reserve. If they were caught without such a document exempting them from the Aborigines Protection Act, they were arrested and returned to the reservation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long ago when I was visiting a children's service in Brisbane I met a man in his mid-forties&mdash;the average age of members of this House. To this day, he carries a small green booklet in his pocket, which was his passport. Without this, he was imprisoned on a reserve. All these things happened in my lifetime, and I am one of the youngest members in this place. It meant that, if any of us had been born a half-caste Aborigine, the chances are that we would have been forcibly removed from our mothers and raised in an institution, and the chances are that we would not have gone very far beyond primary school education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked of these matters to groups within the community, and on a number of occasions I have had the same thing happen. There has been someone from South Africa in the audience who has come up to me afterwards and said, `We never went that far in South Africa'. The legacy of this is a population marginalised, dispersed, dispossessed and with very poor education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first Aboriginal man in Australia to graduate from university, Charles Perkins, did so in 1966. The first New Zealand Maori to do the same was in 1901, fully two generations earlier. This is where we come to today. Like it or not, the scrutiny of Aboriginal affairs is not going to go away; it is going to intensify. It is incumbent on us in this place to see that this petty tyranny, this pinpricking domination and utter paternalism&mdash;of which Commissioner Johnston speaks&mdash;is finally put behind us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply have no other choice, because today the debate on Aboriginal affairs is an international one. This year is the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus landing on the east coast of the Americas. That is forcing Europe and the United States to examine the whole colonisation process, as our bicentenary forced us to examine our past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year is the International Year of Indigenous People, and the two countries with which we most closely identify in indigenous matters, New Zealand and Canada, have both decided that it is in their national interest to bury the differences with their native people. They have found that acknowledging problems and attempting to fix them promotes national unity and that the real threat to a secure, stable country is pretending that the problems do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, like it or not, fairly or unfairly, in the international arena we are judged as not having a good record in our relations with our indigenous people. In fact, of the 10 OECD countries that have indigenous people, we are generally rated last. We may all think this to be grossly unfair and overstated, but in politics we know that it is not the facts that count; it is the perception. The perception overseas is just as I have stated it. On that background we have this report and, as a country, we have to make a response to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering the environment in which this royal commission was originally set up: 1987 was a year of an unusually high number of black deaths in custody. Twenty people died that year, which was over double the average number of deaths for the previous seven years. Each successive death drew greater and greater media coverage and fuelled growing anger in the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as today, where every isolated instance of racism, even one that is three years old, is a leading story on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS>, five years ago each death was catapulted to national prominence. When the royal commission finally came, it was also partly in response to a campaign which had been waged since 1984 by the Committee to Defend Black Rights. This Committee had been founded after widespread dissatisfaction with the verdict on the John Pat case in Western Australia. John Pat had died in police custody in Roebourne in 1983. The ABC focused national attention on the John Pat case and other deaths in custody in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program in September 1985; a program that drew angry responses from the Western Australian Police Union, with accusations of bias and inaccuracy. We were also subject to growing international pressure. In the middle of 1987, the London-based anti-slavery movement concluded a two-month study of Australia's Aboriginal population and reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Widespread allegations of physical and psychological abuse of Aborigines in custody . . . including young women and children.</PARA>
<PARA>This report was tabled at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Vancouver. The royal commission was the last of a series of responses made by the Government to quell growing public anger. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs had been given a brief to inquire into Aboriginal involvement within the criminal justice system, but this had lapsed on the calling of the 1987 election. Thus, with a growing number of deaths, in the end there was no choice and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was set up in October 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission, however, was not without its critics, and throughout its three-year history attracted its fair share of publicity. It was expensive. In the end it cost over $30m, but in hindsight some of that criticism was perhaps a bit unfair. In many ways, it was really 99 individual royal commissions, as the commissioners were required to report individually on every one of the 99 deaths in custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the commission allowed us as a country to have some breathing space. It was a circuit breaker which allowed us to really look at why so many Aborigines were in custody and why they appeared to be dying so frequently. The research that came out of the commission was generally first-rate and very valuable. Most importantly, it showed early on that Aborigines were 29 times more likely to be in gaol than non-Aborigines. But, for any given instance of imprisonment, the chance of an Aborigine dying in custody was actually slightly less than that of a European person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate shifted when we realised that it was not so much a problem of what happens after someone goes to gaol, but rather the high numbers of Aboriginal people that are in gaol in the first place. This fact that Aborigines are 29 times more likely to be in prison than non-Aborigines&mdash;as was the case in 1987 and still is the case in many parts of Australia&mdash;makes Aboriginal people one of the most imprisoned races in the world. Except for South African blacks, no group in the world has such a heavy over-representation in prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this figure is somewhat misleading, and it is a great pity that the research did not go one step further. The age profile of Aboriginal people is significantly different from that of the general Australian population. The birth rate is higher; life expectancy is less. No doubt this skewed age profile would contribute to high imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole of the difference is consistently ascribed to race; that is, because someone is an Aborigine he has a 29 times higher likelihood of being in gaol. This is clearly not the case.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows us something of the poverty in Aboriginal society, and no doubt a good proportion of that increase is, in fact, due to poverty rather than aboriginality; how much so, we do not know. It would have been interesting to look at imprisonment rates in Melbourne Housing Commission flats or Sydney's outer west. If this had been done, I suspect we would have found that a good part of this increase could be explained by poverty. That is a pity because so much of the debate today is on technical methods to keep Aborigines out of gaol, whereas it might have been on ways of addressing Aboriginal poverty as a preventative measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the royal commission tell us of those 99 people who died in custody? It is, in fact, a rather chilling profile. Of the 99 people, 88 were males and 11 were female. The mean age at the time of death was 32. Of the 99, only two had completed secondary education and only one had completed vocational training at TAFE; 83 were unemployed at the time of their last detention; and 43 had been separated as children from their natural families by the action of government. In Western Australia and Queensland, over half had been separated from their natural families; in New South Wales, just on half. Of the 99, 37 had died of natural causes while in gaol. The average age of those dying of natural causes was 30. The health of this group of people ranged from poor to very poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the 339 recommendations themselves. These recommendations cover an enormous variety of areas. Many are purely custodial in nature and cover areas as diverse as relations with the police, youth and justice, diversion of arrest, bail issues, courts, custody and Aboriginal legal services. These generally receive unanimous support by the Commonwealth and Territory governments. Other recommendations relate to all areas of endeavour in Aboriginal affairs, housing and infrastructure through health, jobs and schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it has been impossible for me in 48 hours to discuss with all of my colleagues the 1,400 pages and 339 individual recommendations. However, the most important areas of overlap are those with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). In commenting on these recommendations, I must say that they are at this stage only our personal views. With the time span involved it would not have been possible any other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discussed the issues relating to law and justice with the shadow Attorney-General and, with only minor exceptions, we find the recommendations unexceptionable and sensible. Many of the recommendations relating to diversion from arrest, bail and representation before the courts are ones which really should apply to the whole community, not just one segment of it. This applies particularly to bail issues, breath testing of people taken into custody, and families of deceased being entitled to legal representation at coronial inquiries. That these recommendations should have wider application does not mean that we do not support their introduction for Aboriginal people; it simply means that we hope that governments at all levels might look at their broader application. In the area of health, I have discussed the recommendations with the shadow Minister for health and, again, we view them as sensible and desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations are long overdue. Recommendation 45, proposing a special national survey of the social, demographic, health and economic characteristics of Australia's Aboriginal population, is welcomed. My view is that such a survey should be carried out in conjunction with the census. In that way it would provide the most meaningful data. In so much of Aboriginal affairs, our endeavour has been merely based on guesswork or anecdotal evidence. We have to be honest with ourselves as to whether or not our policies are achieving what we wish them to, and this special survey will give us a basis on which we can determine our benchmarks and look at our success or otherwise of the programs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations have been overtaken by events. Recommendation 339 states that all governments support the process of reconciliation. This has now happened. After  the areas of the Attorney-General and health, the majority of recommendations relate to ATSIC and those Aboriginal education programs within DEET. The majority again appear relevant and sensible, and the agreement by the Commonwealth and States on the majority of them reflects the fact that there is a growing agreement as to what is successful and what is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one part of the report, however, that has the potential to cause major conflict. This conflict may be more perceived than real and it may not be insurmountable. It relates to recommendation 188 which talks about ensuring that the self-determination principle is applied in the design and implementation of any policy. I do not wish to open up old wounds, for it was on this very word&mdash;and only this word&mdash;of self-determination that the first motion in this new Parliament House on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders failed to attract the full support of the House. As I said, I do not want to open up old wounds; rather, I would like to use this opportunity, hopefully, to lead to a better understanding of and some dialogue on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report talks a great deal about self-determination. Indeed, self-determination comes through every single volume of the report. In the overview, Commissioner Johnston states, when talking of the requirement to adhere to the principles of self-determination:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a concept which&mdash;I think&mdash;does not have a precise definition.</PARA>
<PARA>The difficulty with this is that Commissioner Johnston is, in fact, wrong. The principle of self-determination has a specific and precise meaning in international law. It is contained in the first article of the United Nations Charter of 1945 and it is also contained in the first article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>Rights. Let me read them both. In the Charter of the United Nations, a second purpose of the UN is stated as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to develop friendly relations amongst nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples. . .</PARA>
<PARA>In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status. . .</PARA>
<PARA>In both these texts, the word `peoples' was chosen over contending terms of minorities or nations. In international law, indigenous people are not a people, for the meaning of these two texts. There are people of Kuwait who have a right to self-determination but that applies to the nation as a whole, not a minority within it&mdash;even an indigenous minority. This is not just of historical interest. In the draft declaration of the Working Group on Indigenous Peoples, the usage of the word `peoples' is specifically precluded by the United Nations from conferring the rights associated with the word in international law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for self-determination is thus inextricably tied up in international law with the idea of an independent sovereign state. It is not adapted to degrees of autonomy less than full autonomous self-government. We can talk of degrees of autonomy and devolution, but there are no degrees of sovereign statehood. Thus the idea of self-determination within the wider state, or self-determination under a wider law, is in itself contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish it were not so. I would like to find a way around it. It would be much easier for me to pretend that self-determination or the principle of self-determination meant whatever one wished it to mean and that there was room for argument. But I do not see this as the case for, in international law, self-determination applies to sovereign states, and neither the Labor Party nor the coalition has ever suggested that we should be talking about dividing Australian's sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stating this, I do not want to get caught in a tyranny of words, because I suspect that the concept that we talk of in self-management and the concept the Government talks of in self-determination are similar concepts using different words. When the royal commission talks of policies of self-determination over the last 20 years, it fails to recognise that these have been policies of one political party. It has not been a continuous policy of successive governments nor a continuing policy of successive State governments; it has been a policy of Labor State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that the coalition does not believe that it is desirable for Aboriginal people, in matters relating to their own internal and local affairs, to have the greatest possible degree of autonomy consistent with obligations to the broader community. Our support for ATSIC and our long held policy position that Aboriginal people have the right, as a right, to choose to live a traditional lifestyle and to preserve their culture, support our view that, when Aboriginal people have control over those matters that affect their day to day lives, they have by far the greatest chance of developing self-reliance, independence, dignity and choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, in international law, an emerging concept of internal self-determination. Perhaps, in the future, this will offer us a way out. However, it is just, as I said, an emerging concept. It does not have a body of legal precedent behind it and there is not general acceptance as to what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk of areas of concern that I have within the royal commission report itself and the Government response to it. I raise these as concerns, not as criticisms, in the hope that they can provide a constructive point of view as to the limitations the coalition sees with the approach being taken at the moment. These concerns relate to three areas: the first is the limitation of government itself; the second is the challenge of helping Aboriginal people move from a welfare dependent state; the third is the administration of Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first concern is that government alone will never solve the challenge facing Aboriginal Australians. This is clearly recognised in the royal commission when, in the overview, Commissioner Johnston talks of three essential prerequisites to Aboriginal people having control over their lives and their communities. His first essential pre-requisite, and the most crucial, is the desire and capacity of Aboriginal people to put an end to their disadvantaged situation and to take control of their lives. In his words, `There can be no other way'. Only the Aboriginal people can, in the final analysis, ensure their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second pre-requisite is assistance from the broad society and this, basically, means assistance from government, with the support of the electorate or, at least, without its opposition. According to the Commissioner, the third pre-requisite is having in place an established method and procedure whereby the broader society can supply the assistance, and the Aboriginal society can receive it, without a welfare dependent position being established between the two groups. I agree with this totally. What Commissioner Johnston is talking about, in effect, is a partnership between the Australian Government, Aboriginal people and the broader community, and there is simply no other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Partnership' is a word that is hardly ever used in this country, yet it is not a meaningless concept. It should underpin everything we do and seek to achieve in Aboriginal affairs. Partnership is the underpinning of the entire policy that Canada and New Zealand have towards their indigenous people. Yet partnership seems to be almost forgotten in Australia. In the royal commission, after having clearly identified the need for partnership, not just between governments but right across the community, the report then seems to forget it. The rest of the report relates, by and large, to what government can or should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pity because no amount of government assistance in Aboriginal education, for example, is going to be successful if Aboriginal parents still do not want to send their kids to school. No amount of money spent on programs to combat petrol sniffing or substance abuse is going to work unless the community wishes to take responsibility for what is going on in its midst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to share with the House my experience of the most successful anti-petrol sniffing program being run in the country. It runs at Daly River. There are no petrol sniffing problems whatsoever, in spite of it being endemic right across the Top End. When I met with the chairperson of the local community, a woman who is also principal of the school, we were in the community store. I asked her about petrol sniffing. The conversation went something like this. I asked, `Do you have a petrol sniffing problem here in Daly?'. She said, `No, no problem at all'. I asked, `What, you don't have any petrol sniffing at all?'. She said, `Oh, we occasionally catch kids sniffing petrol, but they don't do it again'. I asked, `What do you do?'. She said, `Oh, well, we send them out with the old men for a couple of days'. I asked, `What do the old men do?'. At this point she looked up on the wall of the canteen where there were a whole lot of fairly ferocious looking spears and, looking at the spears, she said, `I am a woman and I wouldn't know anything about that. I don't know what they do, but they certainly never do it again'. What is the total cost of the program? In dollars, zero; in effectiveness, 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end I do not believe we yet have a partnership in this country. It is what we desperately need and what we should desperately work towards. If we have a belief, as I seem to read in the royal commission report or seem to read in the Government's response to this stage, that Government alone has the capacity to turn this around, then we are wrong and we will fail, as we have failed previously. The corollary of this relates to money. When we say that money alone will not fix the problem, we do not mean that money is totally unimportant. It is important, but it is not important for its own sake. It is important for what it can achieve in real, tangible, positive benefits on the ground for Aboriginal people. In all the discussion of the report and in the Government's response to the report, accountability relates to the way we spend the money, but not so much to what the money achieves. In the majority of instances where ATSIC or DEET have performance indicators, those performance indicators relate to the timely disbursement of the money, not what the money achieves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where we have to have a total turnaround in thinking in this country, because while we are prepared to see as sufficient, and prepared to be content with, merely spending the money, or see accountability only in terms of getting the money out, or having enough money to spend, then we are going to miss the point on real accountability. The question is: are we being effective in what we are doing? In this way the issues do not become: whether it is State or Federal jurisdiction or whether it is Aboriginal controlled or non-Aboriginal controlled. They do not become issues of ideology or party politics. The only issue is: does it work? We have some way to go on this score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second concern is this: to me, a fundamental issue in Aboriginal affairs today is: how do we help Aboriginal people move from a position where they are dependent on government to a position where they are self-reliant? Until we face up to this, all other issues are secondary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note in the Minister's speech that in three months time, after discussions with the States, there will be a further report when this issue will be addressed. I am pleased to note that the royal commission mentions this in its introduction, but, unfortunately, the concept seems to get lost after that introduction. I have to say that fundamentally this is not an issue of money. No-one in his right mind is going to say that another $50m a year is going to make the difference either way between welfare dependency and self-reliance. The problem here fundamentally is one of attitude&mdash;attitude on both sides; the attitude in the broader Australia community to supply the support needed for Aboriginal people, not just financial support, but encouragement, patience and understanding for Aboriginal people to develop an economic base. It will need that support. It also requires a change of attitude in many Aboriginal people. In Commissioner Johnston's words, `The desire to put an end to their disadvantaged situation and take control of their own lives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of my reply today, and much of what has been talked about in recent days, has actually focused on failure; on failure of the system and on failure of successive governments. Not all in Aboriginal affairs today is failure. There are some fabulous successes happening in this country. The royal commission alludes to some of them. It talks about the Tangentyere Council and about the community at Port Lincoln. I have had similar experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who spends considerable time in Aboriginal Australia has had the same experiences, whether it be from the Aboriginal fruit growing operations at Cardwell in Queensland, the success of the pastoral enterprise at Woorabinda, the Aboriginal coordinating council at Moree, or the communities at Daly River, Robinson River and Wallace Rockhole in the Northern Territory. All these communities are stunning successes and they all have one thing in common. Aboriginal people have become tired of waiting for others to do it and have taken control of their own lives to make things happen. As Commissioner Johnston says, `There can be no other way'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the Minister's response in three months time. I look forward to seeing how Government will help Aboriginal people develop an independent economic base. I believe that after the development of a partnership, development of an economic base is the greatest challenge we face. If we do not face it, then self-management, or self-determination, whatever we call it, is reduced to talking about how Aborigines control the government money given to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third area of concern relates to administration of programs and Aboriginal organisations. This is vital because these are the vehicles by which benefits pass to people in the community. Aboriginal programs in DEET appear to be in a real shambles. In recent years, successive Auditor-General reports on DEET programs have shown insufficient verification checks for applications, insufficient information on clients' application forms, lack of coordination with other departments and no procedures to avoid duplication of payments. The most recent Auditor-General's report stated that auditing was not undertaken in relation to $80m of expenditure under Aboriginal education supplementary assistance because auditing had revealed that departmental records were not adequate to determine whether payments were valid or accurate. DEET accepted this. In its own words, `Sufficient documentary evidence was unable to be located to support the expenditure relating to this program'. We are talking about $80m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Year after year these issues are raised; year after year DEET states they are being addressed; year after year the Auditor-General expresses these concerns; year after year DEET says something will happen. Year after year nothing happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the Auditor-General stated that the Department had breached section 34 of the Audit Act relating to authorisation of expenditure for bona fide purposes. The Auditor-General raised this as a major concern in audit reports dating back to 1987. The departmental response has been effectively the same since that time, namely, action to correct the situation will take place. Five years later we are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability has to start at home. Unless the Federal Government can be accountable for its own expenditure in those departments that it has control over, we cannot ask for the same sort of accountability in Aboriginal organisations. Aboriginal organisations themselves are pivotal for the future of Aboriginal people. Most of our funding is channelled through Aboriginal organisations, and their effectiveness, or the lack of it, will determine whether the benefits and programs, for which we have so much hope in this place, make one jot of difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the additional programs that the Minister announced on Tuesday, these funds will be channelled via ATSIC to Aboriginal organisations in the main. Yet, the effectiveness of these organisations, or their ability to deliver desired outcomes, is not even questioned. The royal commission does not touch on this, yet there are very real problems here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own State of Victoria, two years ago when I first became shadow Minister I decided to see how many Aboriginal organisations I could identify. I found 174 for 12 1/2 thousand Aboriginal people. That is one organisation for every 72 Aborigines. Today there are almost certainly more. This is not to criticise Aboriginal organisations per se. Many do a fabulous job, but as they are pivotal in the area of service delivery to Aboriginal people, they have to be subject to greater accountability. Let me give some examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long ago I was travelling in remote Australia. I visited a town where an alcohol rehabilitation organisation asked to see me. I met with it, visited its officers and they told me with great pride about their organisation and what they hoped to achieve. It was fully funded, had a number of staff positions, a car and offices. Things went well until I asked them how many people they had actually helped. They looked at me a bit puzzled and said, `Well, we haven't actually seen anybody yet'. This might be an extreme example, nonetheless it happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest initiatives in Tuesday's announcement were in the areas of Aboriginal legal services. The extra funding to meet the main recommendations of the royal commission will be channelled through Aboriginal legal services. Yet, Aboriginal legal services are structures that are not open and transparent. Many produce no annual reports, in spite of their being repeatedly requested to do so. ATSIC itself generally has no idea of whether or not the money it is handing over is being used effectively and wisely. It hands it over, closes its eyes, crosses its fingers and hopes it will work. Not long ago ATSIC had to take the New South Wales Aboriginal legal service to court to recover $94,000 that a couple of its directors had spent on a one-week jaunt around Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This same New South Wales Aboriginal legal service pursued a custody case that legal aid had rejected as hopeless, unwinnable and with no merit. This case involved grandparents attempting to adopt their murdered daughter's children. An eminent child psychiatrist stated strongly that the interests of the children were with their maternal grandparents, yet the Aboriginal legal service put this family through a custody battle of 18 hearings at a cost to the grandparents of $30,000. This prompted the children's psychiatrist to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very concerned that the Aboriginal legal service is wasting it<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>s scarce resources on such an inappropriate and unwinnable case without any apparent thought for the stress and damage being caused. The ongoing and protracted litigation is causing enormous financial and emotional burden on the grandparents, destabilising the children's security and emotional well being.</PARA>
<PARA>The irony of all this is that the child over whom the custody was being fought had no Aboriginal blood whatsoever. The only Aboriginal person was an Aboriginal step-grandfather. The child herself was being raised in the Jewish faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not long ago a proposal to establish a new Aboriginal legal service was handed to me. I will not mention its name, as my purpose of this is not to embarrass the service, but I read it for the benefit of honourable members. This is what was being asked for: branch office staff&mdash;one office manager, one secretary, six field officers, three welfare workers, four administrative assistants, one bookkeeper and two clerical staff. Then, after asking for 18 people, it must have felt a bit guilty and, as it was a legal service, thought it should have some solicitors, so there were three solicitors. The list continues: non-legal section, office equipment&mdash;one computer, one 10-inch printer, one photocopier, three typewriters/word processors, dictaphone, facsimile machine, appropriate complement of filing cabinets, desks, storage cupboards, et cetera; in the legal section&mdash;one computer, one 10-inch printer, two typewriters/word processors, one dictaphone, appropriate complement of filing cabinets, desks, chairs, storage cupboards, a telephone switchboard operating one telephone number with eight lines and 15 telephone units, two-way radio with base and five units in the field, video cameras, tape recorders, motor vehicles; non-legal section&mdash;three passenger vehicles, one nine-seater bus; legal section&mdash;two passenger vehicles. The list goes on. This is a $1.5m small business and, if this is indicative of how Aboriginal legal services operate around the country, I shudder to think how much of the extra assistance is actually going to make it onto the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the report in general: the Government's response is a monumental work. Collating 339 responses from eight governments is no easy feat. I commend the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) for his work on this. On the Federal level we often disagree; however, we have made an effort to look for common ground. It is disappointing that the responses of many of the States have appeared to be self-serving, publicity seeking and have not taken the same initiative as we have tried to take at a Federal level. This report does offer a great opportunity to take a step forward. We really must take advantage of it. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Government took office in 1983, most people would look to the age pension as their main source of retirement income. Superannuation was the preserve of a few, mainly the wealthy, and a substantial proportion of concessionally taxed superannuation savings was dissipated well before retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform of superannuation has been one of the great achievements of the Government. Over its term of office, the Government has greatly expanded access to superannuation savings. In particular, award superannuation has fostered the spread of superannuation to large areas of the work force which previously had no cover. The Government has also restructured the tax concessions for superannuation to make them more consistent with retirement incomes objectives, while still maintaining them at a generous level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, access to superannuation concessions has been made substantially more equitable.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms have moved superannuation from being a concessionally taxed source of windfall gains for high income earners towards being a genuine retirement savings vehicle for most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to office, 40 per cent of the work force had some superannuation cover; in 1991, the proportion was 72 per cent. On this basis alone, our reforms of superannuation are an achievement which the retirees of the  future will value highly. Despite these reforms, there is an ongoing need to ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to superannuation. There is also a need to increase the average level of superannuation savings for each individual, if these savings are to provide an adequate level of retirement income. Consistent with these goals, the superannuation guarantee levy was announced in last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee levy represents another major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy. It will lay the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for future generations of retirees. The superannuation guarantee levy provides:</PARA>
<PARA>.a major extension of superannuation coverage;</PARA>
<PARA>.an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply with their award obligations; and</PARA>
<PARA>.an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>The levy will consolidate the reforms implemented since 1983, and will provide a coherent and equitable framework in which retirement incomes objectives can be progressed. It will ensure that, by the beginning of the next century, virtually all employees will be accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased self-provision for retirement will permit a higher standard of living in retirement than if we continued to rely on the age pension alone. The increased self-provision will also enable future Commonwealth governments to improve the retirement conditions for those Australians who were unable to fund adequately their own retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, self-provision will increase the flexibility in the Commonwealth's Budget in future years, especially as our population ages, and will increase our national savings overall, thus reducing our reliance on the savings of foreigners to fund our development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December last year an information paper was released for comment on issues raised by the operation of the superannuation guarantee levy. The Government then undertook wide ranging consultations on the issues raised by the information paper. As a result of the consultation process, this package of measures contains some changes to the proposals outlined in that information paper. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">How the Superannuation Guarantee Scheme Will Work</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, which applies from 1 July 1992, will encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support for employees. Where employers provide less than the minimum level of superannuation support, they will be liable for a superannuation guarantee charge. The superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;which will not be a deductible expense for employers&mdash;will be used to meet the superannuation contribution entitlements of the relevant employee and will be used, as I discuss later, to fund administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should stress that this mechanism is not intended to be the principal vehicle for the funding of employee's superannuation contribution entitlements. It is intended, instead, to be an incentive for employers to meet their own obligations, and to be a support mechanism for employees where those obligations are not met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing the levy, the Government has been particularly conscious of minimising the labour cost impact of the levy on employers. We have designed the levy to be a floor under existing superannuation arrangements. All existing employer superannuation support that meets the provisions of the levy arrangements will count towards the minimum prescribed level of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of superannuation support an employer is expected to provide will depend on the employer's annual payroll. For the 1992-93 year, employers with an annual payroll in excess of $500,000 will be expected to contribute 5 per cent of an employee's earnings base to a complying superannuation fund. This percentage will increase over the next nine years to 9 per cent. Employers with an annual payroll of $500,000 or less will be required to contribute 3 per cent, increasing on a slower transition schedule to 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An employee's earnings base will depend on whether the employer was providing superannuation support for employees on 20 August 1991. Employers who, on that date, were contributing to a superannuation scheme which has an earnings base can continue to use that earnings base so long as it is not reduced. This will help minimise compliance costs. In any other case, the employer will be assessed against an earnings base that the employer is required to use under an industrial award or a base not less than ordinary time earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation support must be provided through a complying superannuation fund in order to be counted towards the minimum level of superannuation support. The fund can be either a defined contribution fund or a defined benefit fund. In the case of a defined benefit fund, the employer will be required to obtain an actuarial certificate specifying the level of employer superannuation support implicit in the benefits available to employees in the fund. For all other funds, the employer's level of support will be based on the actual contributions made to the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of superannuation support will be measured on a financial year basis for the 1992-93 year. However, where an employer has provided insufficient superannuation support during that year, the employer will be able to make up any shortfall in contributions by 14 August 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided that, from the 1993-94 year and in subsequent years, employer support will be measured on a monthly basis. The employer will be expected to provide the minimum level of superannuation support during the month or within 28 days of the end of the month. However, if there is a shortfall in employer superannuation support, the superannuation guarantee charge will not be due until 14 August in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an employer does not provide the minimum level of superannuation support, a charge will be imposed on the employer. The charge will be equal to the sum of:</PARA>
<PARA>.the total of the employer's individual superannuation guarantee shortfalls;</PARA>
<PARA>.an interest component; and</PARA>
<PARA>.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an administration component. </PARA>
<PARA>A superannuation shortfall for an employee is calculated by applying to the employee's salary and wages the percentage difference between the minimum level of superannuation support and the actual employer support. The interest component is a proxy for superannuation fund earnings. The interest will be calculated from the commencement of the financial year until the time the superannuation guarantee charge is due to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the administration charge is to recover some of the costs incurred in administering the tax. The charge will initially consist of a flat amount of $50 plus an amount of $30 for each employee in respect of whom the employer has a superannuation shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Award Superannuation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to support the inclusion in existing superannuation award provisions of the rates of contribution to superannuation funds required by the superannuation guarantee scheme as they become operative. The Government considers that, where there is no agreement between the parties to an existing award superannuation provision nominating a particular fund, the fund to which such additional award contributions are to be made should be determined by the relevant industrial tribunal looking to the best interests of the beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee scheme is designed to encourage employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation support. It is intended to improve the position of those employees who have inadequate superannuation coverage. It is not designed to provide a mechanism for a general increase in superannuation support for those employees who are already receiving in excess of the prescribed minimum level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government expects that increases in the prescribed minimum level would not result in additional contributions in cases where employers were already providing superannuation support at or above that level. Of course, parties are free to negotiate levels of superannuation support above the minimum as part of enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many employers already provide such higher levels, often through a combination of contributions to industry funds and employer funds. In such cases, the Government expects negotiations between the parties on a case-by-case basis would determine the fund or funds to which superannuation guarantee/award contributions would be made. Any breakdown in negotiations should be referred to the relevant industrial tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Exemptions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the superannuation guarantee scheme, an employer will not be expected to provide superannuation support for employees who are under 18 years of age and who are working part time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to proposed changes in the areas of telephone concessions, Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance, social security agreements with other countries, debt recovery, the income and assets test, compensation payments and data matching. The Bill also provides for a number of minor and technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991 Budget the Government announced that from 1 July 1992 a new payment, known as telephone allowance, would replace the telephone rental concession voucher scheme. The new allowance will be more user friendly in that under the old concession scheme vouchers were sometimes misplaced or lost and pensioners were put to the inconvenience of obtaining replacements. It will also be much simpler to administer. The telephone allowance will be a payment of $51.80 per household each year. A lower rate of $25.90 per year will be paid where the person commenced to receive pension or benefit after 12 March 1992 and the person's partner is not getting a social  security payment. It will be paid in quarterly instalments to pensioners who are permanently blind or who satisfy fringe benefit means tests and who are telephone subscribers. It will also be payable to certain social security beneficiaries aged 60 or over who are telephone subscribers and to certain other recipients of Commonwealth fringe benefits. The allowance will be indexed annually in line with CPI increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the Government introduced a series of measures directed at young people under 18 years of age. One measure extended qualification for Job Search allowance and sickness allowance to 15-year-olds who meet the requirements for those allowances&mdash;apart from age&mdash;who are above the minimum school leaving age or have a formal exemption from attending school, who have an employment history, and who are not living with or being supported by a parent. This Bill will provide that 15-year-old Job Search allowance or sickness allowance recipients who are in substitute care, often referred to as foster care, will also be paid the higher independent rate of allowance. This measure will align the rate of Job Search allowance and sickness allowance for 15-year-olds with the rate for 16- to 17-year-olds in substitute care. It will further improve the overall level of income support to families who do not receive a substitute care allowance from a State or Territory authority and will encourage the substitute care of young people who may otherwise be at risk of homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will assist sole parents receiving Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance or sickness allowance whose only child is under 16 years and in employment. From the day of royal assent, the allowance will be paid at the higher maximum basic rate that is currently payable to a sole parent pensioner. This will ensure equitable treatment for pensioners and beneficiaries in similar circumstances. The allowee's  child, despite being employed, will be taken to be dependent for the purposes of working out the allowee's maximum basic rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will remove an unintended restriction in the Social Security Act which prevents a recipient of Job Search allowance who is 18 or over, or Newstart allowance who is incapacitated for work for a period which is expected to be longer than six weeks in the case of Job Search allowance or 13 weeks in the case of Newstart allowance from being qualified for sickness allowance for six or 13 weeks. The Bill will enable the recipient to transfer to sickness allowance once the person is no longer qualified for Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance, subject to the recipient satisfying the usual qualification conditions for sickness allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will continue to target the provision of social security to those in need of assistance. To this end, the qualification conditions for Job Search allowance and Newstart allowance will be amended so that a person who is the subject of an assurance of support&mdash;the assuree&mdash;will not be qualified for Job Search allowance or Newstart allowance if the Secretary is satisfied that the assuror is willing to provide the person with an adequate level of support and it is reasonable to expect the person to accept that support. As a consequence of this measure, an assuror who is willing and able to comply with his or her obligations under an assurance of support will not incur a debt to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inappropriate for assurees who enter Australia on the understanding that they will be supported by an assuror to refuse, without good reason, to accept support which the assuror is willing and able to provide. Conversely, the interests of assurees will be protected by not requiring the assuree to accept such support in all cases; for example, where the assuree is subjected to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austria is set to become the latest partner in the network of social security agreements between Australia and other countries. The Bill will provide for implementation of the agreement with Austria once it has been signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains a measure which will facilitate the Department's capacity and responsibility to recover social security debts. The Act will be amended to provide that if a person owes to the Commonwealth an amount which is recoverable under the Act, the Secretary may recover the amount by making deductions from instalments of pension, benefit or allowance payable to another person. The consent of the latter person would be necessary. It will usually be the debtor's partner or relation who will agree to the deductions being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Director of Public Prosecutions has commented critically on provisions in the Social Security Act which have created difficulties in prosecuting social security fraud. This Bill will remove these obstacles by repealing the provisions that prevent a social security recipient from relying on the privilege against self-incrimination when requested under the Act to provide information. The provisions that limit the use of information obtained from social security recipients, pursuant to the information gathering powers under the Act, will also be repealed. From the day of royal assent, pensioners, beneficiaries and allowees will have the same right as other citizens not to provide information that may tend to incriminate them in an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make a number of changes to the rules for the ordinary income test and the assets test. For some time now, people who are `asset rich but income poor' have sought to provide for themselves by accessing the equity in their principal home through a variety of sale/lease-back schemes. At present, under the Act a person who enters into such a scheme is treated as a non-home owner and is allowed the higher non-home owner asset limit under the assets test for pensions, benefits and allowances. In some cases a social security recipient would be better off if he or she was treated as a home owner&mdash;even though home owners are subject to a lower asset limit&mdash;because any amount outstanding under the contract of sale would be disregarded under the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will therefore align the treatment of sale/lease-back schemes with the treatment of retirement village residences and granny flat living arrangements. As a consequence, a person entering into a sale/lease-back agreement will be given the most advantageous result, whether as a home owner or a non-home owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mark Fitzpatrick Trust was established by the Government in 1989 to provide special financial assistance to people with medically acquired HIV infection and AIDS, their dependants and carers. In keeping with the Government's intention in setting up the trust, the Bill will provide that payments made from the trust will not be counted as ordinary income for the purposes of working out a person's rate of pension, benefit or allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 2 December 1991 my predecessor as Minister for Social Security announced a special measure to assist the restructure of unlisted property trusts in the wake of the downturn in sectors of the property market. The Bill will give effect to this by providing that, if a social security recipient with an investment in an unlisted property trust realises that investment and is paid out with investments&mdash;units&mdash;in another trust, any capital growth at the date of realisation will not be counted as ordinary income. However, the units in the other trust will be taken to be a new investment and will be subject to ongoing assessment. Only those investments in unlisted property trusts made or acquired before 9 September 1988 will be affected by this measure. It will apply only to investments in trusts that are realised and paid out with units in other trusts before 23 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make two changes which will assist a person whose partner has died. It will enable certain wife pensioners and carer pensioners who care for their partners to be transferred automatically to sole parent pension after the deaths of their partners without having to lodge a claim for that pension. This will prevent unnecessary intrusion into the person's grief and ensure that there is no break in continuity in the provision of income support where it is apparent that the person would be qualified for sole parent pension after the 14-week bereavement payment period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, a claimant for Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance or sickness allowance must serve a waiting period before receiving payment. The Bill will provide that a person whose partner has died and was receiving Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance or sickness allowance at a rate which included an additional amount for a partner will not have to serve the waiting period if he or she lodges a claim for one of the allowances within four weeks after his or her partner's death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill will make a number of minor changes in the area of compensation recovery, such as stipulating that a payment of arrears of periodic compensation is not a lump sum compensation payment and protecting insurers and compensation payers from legal action where they are prevented from releasing moneys after being served with a notice under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a number of amendments will be made to the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990&mdash;the data matching Act&mdash;and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These amendments relate to the matching of personal information and the use of tax file numbers. Most importantly, the Bill makes explicit that data matching results can be used to increase the assistance a person receives from the Commonwealth. Up to now, the legislative emphasis in that program has been on use of results to reduce assistance. Implementation of the data-matching Act has also demonstrated the need for some minor amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill has three major elements. First, it proposes to alter the salaries of members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It proposes to tie these salaries to those of judges of the Federal Court. Second, it proposes to vary the salaries determined by the Remuneration Tribunal for vice-chancellors and deputy vice-chancellors of the two universities which come within the Commonwealth's responsibility. Third, it proposes to broaden the range of persons eligible to be chairperson of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Bill also proposes to make minor technical corrections and clarifications to existing legislation. The proposed amendments are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may appreciate a reminder of the genesis of the issues dealt with in this Bill. In May 1990, the Government received a determination from the Remuneration Tribunal on judicial and other remuneration. This had the effect&mdash;through the nexus between the salaries of members of the Commission and judges of the Federal Court&mdash;of proposing an increase of 14.3 per cent for members of the Commission. The Government responded by deciding that the remuneration of judges should be raised by 6 per cent with effect from 1 July 1990 and another 6 per cent with effect from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the prevailing climate of recognition of the need for wage restraint by all in the community, the Government decided further that this should be varied: members of the Commission would receive the first stage of the increase but, since the Commission's structure should undergo the same process of review that it was overseeing in other public institutions, the second stage of the increase should be withheld pending this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1990, following the robust discussion which followed these decisions, the Government established a review of the structure and remuneration of members of the Commission. The review was conducted by an eminent group:  Mr Gerry Gleeson, AC, former head of the New South Wales Premier's Department; Justice Trevor Olsson of the South Australian Supreme Court; and Professor Alan Fels, Chairman of the Prices Surveillance Authority. The terms of reference for the review included that regard had to be had, among other things, for the central role of the Commission in industrial relations, its developing relations with State tribunals and the need to maintain its independence and effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the review was presented to the Government on 1 March 1991. Its recommendations included introduction of two new levels within the Commission's structure&mdash;a vice president and senior deputy president&mdash;and a revised structure of salaries. On 20 March 1991, the Government announced that it had accepted the recommendations of the review and that they would form the basis of a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal on the remuneration of members of the Commission. The Government forwarded a submission to the Tribunal on 28 March 1991 and a supplementary submission on 8 May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament passed amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to establish the new Commission structure in May 1991. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has accepted all of the Committee's recommendations as they provide a sound basis on which to strengthen the Commission's structure and to put it in a better position to address its increasing range of responsibilities and the wider scope of its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms will complement the initiatives which the Government took in framing the Industrial Relations Act to enable the Commission to exercise a broader jurisdiction. It will also facilitate the increasing co-operation between the Commission and its State counterparts, including through members of each being commissioned to hold office on both the Federal and State tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 November 1991, six months having elapsed after the granting of royal assent, the amending legislation came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration Tribunal forwarded its determination of remuneration for members of the Commission on 24 December 1991. The determination containing technical defects, the Tribunal indicated that a further determination had to be issued. The Government received this further determination on 9 March 1992. In these determinations, the Tribunal failed to establish salary rates for the new offices and it maintained the previous relativities between the various levels in the Commission structure. The Tribunal indicated that it would not determine remuneration for the new offices until persons were appointed to them and the duties to be performed established. Thus, the Tribunal's determinations prevented establishment of a salary structure for positions which, following the Parliament's decisions on the matter, had come into existence nearly six months earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Government's view that, like those who come before it, the Commission must be able to respond to evolving developments in the industrial relations environment as it adapts to the change taking place in the broad economy. In particular, the Commission must be able to facilitate the increasing cooperation between Federal and State tribunals. The new offices and the consequent revised relativities for the other offices of the Commission are critical for the creation of a more appropriate and effective structure for the Commission. In its amendments to the Industrial Relations Act last year, the Parliament accepted this view. Recruiting persons to fill the new offices, however, cannot be done until the salaries have been set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me sum up for the benefit of honourable members. An eminent committee has conducted a full and objective review of the structure and remuneration of members of the Commission. The Government accepted the proposals of the committee. The Parliament agreed with the Government's decision and acted to create the structure which the committee proposed for the Commission. The Remuneration Tribunal has failed to establish salaries for the new structure which the Parliament has created. Recruiting persons to fill the new offices in this new structure cannot be done until the salaries for these new offices have been set. An impasse has been created, therefore, which the Government must resolve so that the will of the Parliament can be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes the means by which this can be done. It proposes to establish salaries and relativities with judicial salaries as the basis for future remuneration for the five levels of office holders on the Commission. This is in line with the recommendations of the Gleeson Committee which were accepted by the Government and endorsed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes that the salary for the office of President of the Commission should continue to be equivalent to that of the Chief Justice of the Federal Court. The salary rate for the office of Senior Deputy President will become the benchmark for the internal salary relativities in the new Commission structure. It will be equated with that for a judge of the Federal Court. It is proposed that the salary for the office of Vice-President of the Commission should be 3 per cent higher than that for a Senior Deputy President; for the office of Deputy President, 95 per cent of that for a Senior Deputy President; and for the office of Commissioner, 70 per cent of that for a Deputy President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the Gleeson Committee report, the Government proposes to seek advice at regular intervals about the appropriateness of the relativities established by the nexus between salaries of members of the Commission and those of judges of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also proposes to modify the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal relating to vice-chancellors and deputy vice-chancellors of universities within the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The reason for this is the concern which the Government had at the salary levels which the Tribunal has proposed for this group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The salary levels proposed would have given this group significantly greater increases than those received by other public sector executives under the structural efficiency principle. Moreover, the Tribunal's determination anticipated a further review of the remuneration of heads of departments and other senior public sector executives in advance of any consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges the significant restructuring which institutions of higher education have undergone and the impact this has had on the work of vice-chancellors. This restructuring and its effects, however, have been no greater than that which has occurred elsewhere in the public sector at the Senior Executive Service level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces new rates for vice-chancellors of Commonwealth institutions and their deputies consistent with those granted to university academic staffs and senior public servants. There will be appropriate adjustments to funding for non-Commonwealth institutions to reflect this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the question of the timing of these salary increases. The salaries proposed in this Bill for Commissioners of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and for vice-chancellors and their deputies will take effect from the date the Act receives royal assent. This group has already received the salaries proposed by the Remuneration Tribunal from 1 January 1991. The position for presidential members of the Commission is somewhat different because the Tribunal's determination does not take effect until 15 parliamentary sitting days after tabling. To ensure fairness to all concerned, the Government proposes that the new salary levels for presidential members of the Commission should also take effect from 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the proposal to change the qualifications for appointment to chair the Remuneration Tribunal. The details are as follows. Subsection 4(6) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 currently restricts appointment to the position of chairperson of the Tribunal to a person who is a judge or a retired judge of a State court or one who is qualified for appointment as a judge of a State court. This provision is not considered appropriate because of the conflict created as a result of arrangements agreed by the Commonwealth and States to prevent leapfrogging between Federal and State judicial salaries. Because of these arrangements, it could be inferred that the chairperson of the Tribunal, if a judge of a State court, could be in a position to influence his or her own remuneration. This provision also has the effect of restricting the field of candidates for appointment to the position. This Bill therefore proposes to remove this qualification for the position of chairperson of the Tribunal. Persons with legal qualifications will not be precluded from appointment by this action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes three minor technical amendments to the Act. They relate to the validity of certain determinations, the inclusion of an additional office within the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal, and the restoration of an annual leave loading for particular office holders. The details of these proposed minor amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supplementation for additional expenditure in 1991-92 has already been provided to cover the salary increases determined by the Tribunal. The rates proposed in this Bill will reduce the call on the level of supplementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I would like to finish my remarks with two observations. They concern, first, the role of the Parliament in relation to determinations by the Remuneration Tribunal and, second, the standing and independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is alleged in some quarters that members of the Remuneration Tribunal have been offended by the fact that its most recent determination has not been accepted. The Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 which established the Tribunal explicitly provides for its determinations to be disallowed if the Parliament so wishes. Indeed, Parliament disallowed the very first determinations the Tribunal made in 1974. Its determinations have been overturned or modified seven times since then, not only in relation to the remuneration of members of parliament but also of other groups within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must accept the ultimate responsibility for the effects of Tribunal determinations. It is therefore appropriate that it retain the right to disallow or modify these determinations. Indeed, the Opposition acknowledged this as recently as 1990, when Senator Durack stated in the Senate in debate on the Remuneration and Allowances Bill 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many reasons the Opposition has decided that it will not oppose this legislation. It simply wishes to reiterate the firm view that it takes in relation to the proper course of action for governments to take. When all is said and done, the ultimate decision in matters of this sort has to be made by the Government. It has to take the ultimate responsibility and it is not for oppositions to seek by some means or other to change that.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also alleged in some quarters that the Government's decision not to accept the Tribunal's most recent determinations somehow threatens the independence not only of the Tribunal but also of the Commission itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 72 (iii) of the Constitution states that the Justices of the High Court and other courts created by the Parliament `shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix: but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office'. Is it seriously suggested that this constitutional duty of the Parliament threatens the independence of the judiciary either in fact or in appearance?  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Tribunal was established, decisions about the remuneration of all Federal judges and members of the Federal industrial tribunal were made by Cabinet on the advice of a very small committee of senior public servants. Is it suggested that this compromised the independence of such eminent Australians as Sir Owen Dixon or Sir Richard Kirby?  To ask these questions is to answer them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has&mdash;and should continue to keep&mdash;a central role in the industrial and economic life of the nation. The Government has no time for the argument that it should be sidelined and made irrelevant to our industrial and economic well-being. It is a crucial influence on our economic policy-making and on our capacity to undergo economic reform. It has helped maintain industrial harmony and stability. It has provided access to wage justice for Australian workers, particularly those without power in the marketplace. Its manifest fairness and competence are the reasons why the tribunal system has been so strongly supported so widely and for so long. The Government's support for the standing, credibility and independence of the Commission remains as clear and as strong as it has ever been. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANSTO has conditioned, stored and managed radioactive materials and wastes for many years both on its own account and on behalf of other parties. However, this activity was recently challenged when the Sutherland Shire Council took action in the NSW Land and Environment Court. It sought, inter alia, to restrain ANSTO from transferring to the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories 17 cubic metres of radioactive waste from the St Marys site of Australian Defence Industries, and to require ANSTO to remove from Lucas Heights Research Laboratories some 2,000 cubic metres of radioactively contaminated soil from the former CSIRO site at Fishermans Bend, Victoria. These wastes were to be stored at Lucas Heights Research Laboratories pending the construction of a national repository for radioactive wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue before the court was whether the storage was in accordance with the provisions of the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. Safety was conceded as not being an issue. The judge accepted that Lucas Heights Research Laboratories is presently the safest site in Australia for the storage of such material. In his decision on 5 February 1992, Mr Justice Cripps found in favour of the Council. His ruling, inter alia, restrained ANSTO from transferring the ADI wastes to Lucas Heights Research Laboratories and ordered ANSTO to remove the CSIRO wastes within three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One effect of these orders is to prevent ANSTO providing certain services essential for public health and safety. These include, for example, bringing to Lucas Heights Research Laboratories for repair packages containing radioactive substances which have been damaged in handling at airports. Such services are obviously in the public interest. In the circumstances, the Government has decided that ANSTO's powers in this area must be placed beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments accord ANSTO the function of conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials and waste from its own activities or from companies in which it has a controlling interest. The function extends to other radioactive substances from persons who are specified in regulations, thereby allowing parliamentary scrutiny where such cases arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments respect the order of the NSW Land and Environment Court that ANSTO must remove the CSIRO waste from Lucas Heights by 5 February 1995. In addition, the ADI waste cannot be moved to Lucas Heights Research Laboratories except by specific regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court has focused attention more sharply on the need for a permanent repository for Australia's low level radioactive wastes. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has been actively seeking the cooperation of the State and Territory governments in locating areas for investigation to identify a suitable site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has ordered a full investigation of the technical, legal and other issues concerning the conditioning, management and interim  storage  of the  ADI  and  CSIRO wastes. A report will be prepared by December 1992 identifying all practicable options. These actions clearly demonstrate that the Government has no intention of allowing the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories to become, de facto, a national radioactive waste repository. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Commercial Activities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government decided some time ago that public research institutions such as ANSTO should be encouraged to become more commercial in their orientation and activities. ANSTO has made good progress in this direction. The proportion of non-Budget revenue in its total revenue reached 30 per cent in the 1990-91 financial year&mdash;two years ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the ANSTO Act constrains the extent to which ANSTO can make further progress. The Act may not be sufficiently specific, for example, to provide for ANSTO's development and operation of its business and t<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>echnology park. These amendments will ensure that ANSTO has a statement of functions which permits it to carry out fully the Government's intentions regarding the commercialisation of its activities. </PARA>

<PARA>Territory Laws </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The degree to which ANSTO, a Commonwealth instrumentality situated in the State of New South Wales, is legally bound by NSW laws is a complex issue. The policy of successive Commonwealth governments is that such instrumentalities are to operate consistently with all State laws where there is no existing parallel Commonwealth law and where those laws do not directly conflict with the existing ANSTO Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, advice has been received from the Attorney-General's Department that the ANSTO Act does not provide that ANSTO is a Commonwealth agent or emanation. ANSTO may, therefore, be fully subject to the laws of the State of New South Wales. The Commonwealth has never intended that ANSTO should be fully subject to State laws. Indeed, this situation is unacceptable, as it may impair ANSTO's ability to carry out its functions properly and may even be prejudicial to safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, ANSTO is to be provided with immunity from certain classes of State and Territory laws. Similar clauses are included in the legislation which established ADI and the Civil Aviation Authority. On the advice of the Attorney-General's Department, the proposed amendment is to apply retrospectively. Once again, the amendment respects the judgment of the NSW Land and Environment Court in that it contains a clause excluding the CSIRO waste from immunity after 4 February 1995. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nuclear Safety Bureau</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANSTO Act established a Nuclear Safety Bureau which is responsible to the Minister for monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant operated by the organisation. The ANSTO board appoints the staff of the Bureau and may assign it other functions to perform. In practice, the NSB has operated with complete independence of ANSTO's management. However, the structure of the Act means that the independence of the NSB is open to question. The Government has decided, therefore, to amend the Act to ensure that the NSB is independent of ANSTO de jure as well as de facto. The new NSB will have the principal functions of monitoring and reviewing the safety of any nuclear plant owned or operated by ANSTO, and of providing technical advice to the Commonwealth on the safety of nuclear plant and related matters. It will be funded directly by parliamentary appropriation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to be part of this debate which, as I am sure honourable members will be aware, has been very wide-ranging thus far. I am sure my contribution and the contribution of those following me will not be much different. At the outset, I make the observation that today around 25,000 families in the Northern Territory, with more than 42,000 children, will receive an additional special payment of family allowance of between $125 and $250 tax free. That is a welcome boost of around $4m to the Northern Territory economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government first announced this expenditure, some people within the Northern Territory community bagged it. That is a polite way of putting it. Not only do they not understand the nature of the Northern Territory community; they do not understand the needs of many people within it. The most scandalous observation has been made by two members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and, in my opinion, it was quite racist. The observation which was made during a debate was that this money would be used on grog. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That observation was aimed at a particular group within the community. I believe it is reprehensible. It is something which should not happen. I believe that the people about whom these remarks were made should be given an apology. That has not happened. Unfortunately the people in the Northern Territory are used to these sorts of statements coming from conservative politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of great embarrassment to me as a Northern Territorian and to many people in the constituency; in fact, I would argue, without a shadow of a doubt, that it would be an embarrassment to the vast majority of people in the Northern Territory. It is time for the people who made those observations to shut up. The people who have taken the obligatory step of casting aspersions upon a particular group within our community should stop doing so, stop attacking them, stop undermining them and look at a positive way to build up community relations and assist people who are in need. That is what this money does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the 1,790 families that receive the family allowance supplement&mdash;that figure does not include those families who receive this payment as part of their pension or benefit&mdash;will gain a further $3.00 per week. More Territory families will be eligible for this allowance after the One Nation increase in the income eligibility limit. This is real help for Territory families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement goes a lot further in helping Territorians. It addresses areas of concern in a number of industries, including tourism, which is a significant private sector employee in the Territory. The increase in the amortisation rate on tourism income producing buildings; the more generous depreciation rates; the ability to write off tourism infrastructure; and a $15m international tourism advertising campaign will be of genuine, immediate and lasting value to an industry which has suffered in the past as a result of a number of things, not exclusively, including the pilots dispute and the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to tourism, other announcements in the One Nation statement mean that projects such as the Darwin to Alice Springs railway and new mining projects are more likely to become viable in the near future. An amount of $6m has been allocated for the upgrading of the Kakadu Highway. In addition, there is to be a very much needed new bus terminal, roadworks in Tennant Creek, and the Victoria River Highway is to be widened. By the time the project has been finalised, Federal Government expenditure on upgrading the Victoria Highway will be around $100m, a not insignificant amount. An amount of $18m has been allocated to develop the Three Ways to Brisbane link of the national highway network. I know that those people who travel on the Barkly Highway from Three Ways to Mount Isa and onward to Brisbane will appreciate that much needed expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures from the One Nation statement add to the significant Commonwealth expenditure already in the Northern Territory, particularly in the area of defence works and its related housing and other infrastructure. Of course, the vast majority of Territory taxpayers will benefit from the tax cuts also announced in the One Nation statement. There is no doubt of the positive impacts for the Northern Territory of not only the One Nation statement but also of the Government's ongoing commitment and programs in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Opposition who were part of the episode which occurred during Question Time today will need to spend time thinking about their actions. I would like to make just one quick observation: it showed an Opposition which had a glass jaw, which was unable to defend the indefensible, which was unable to carry the arguments on the merit of the policies it was putting forward, and which had to resort to the sorts of tactics of trying to disrupt this Parliament by subjecting the Chair to unfair criticism. The way those opposite have behaved in the last few days is a very poor reflection on their ability to state their case. It is also an indication of the strength and validity of the Government's arguments about the Opposition's `Frightback' package.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have done a great job, Mr Deputy Speaker, and you have filled many chaff bags. Before it was time to shove the nosebag on, I was about to address the impact of the Opposition's goods and services tax on the constituents of the Northern Territory. I would like to go through the issues that have arisen as a result of the national prices task force March results. Its survey of groceries shows that the average basket price for the Northern Territory was $83.93. If we take 10 per cent off the prices of those goods currently subject to a wholesale tax&mdash;and this is being generous to the Opposition, because we are taking only 10 per cent off the retail price, not the wholesale price&mdash;and add a 15 per cent goods and services tax to the balance, we find that the average Darwin resident will be paying $93.15 for his or her basket, which is an increase of $12.16. If we carry out the same exercise on an Adelaide basket, the value of goods in the basket comes to $75.60, which is an increase of $9.86. A Darwin family is paying 23 per cent more for that basket of goods after the imposition of the goods and services tax than its counterparts in Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask Opposition members whether that is what they mean by helping families. I would like to ask them further what they mean by helping families who really suffer as a result of the tremendously high expenses in terms of buying the essential items of food and clothing. Let me give an example. A breakdown of the typical foods that might be bought in a remote community&mdash;that is, essentially, a remote Aboriginal community in northern Australia&mdash;is provided by Gracey and Sullivan, who constructed what they call the market basket based on food consumption patterns amongst Aboriginal families in the Kimberley. In a moment I will give the estimate of Gracey and Sullivan of the commonest food purchases of an average family of mother, father, two children and one baby for a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent examination of the price of these goods in a typical Sydney supermarket&mdash;this survey was undertaken in about November of last year&mdash;suggests that this basket would be purchased for $237 in a capital city, in this case Sydney. We should bear in mind that the costs in Darwin would be at least 10 to 30 per cent higher than they are in Sydney. Research by the Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services indicated that foodstuff prices in remote community stores might be between 30 and 60 per cent higher than Darwin supermarket prices, which are themselves approximately between 10 and 30 per cent higher than the average capital city rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we assume that the remote community prices are 40 per cent higher than in Darwin, this makes them approximately 54 per cent&mdash;if we use the 10 per cent higher prices for Darwin&mdash;higher than those in capital cities. On this basis, the basket of goods could be expected to cost $365 in remote communities&mdash;$237 in Sydney and $365 in a remote Aboriginal community. In all probability, in a remote Aboriginal community, 80 to 90 per cent of the population would be on unemployment benefits or some other welfare benefit. Of course, this estimate could be conservative. In many communities, prices can be double those in capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the basket of goods which I have here, sales tax is payable on only soft drink, chips, sweet and cream biscuits, and orange juice. Soft drink is taxed at 20 per cent of the wholesale price; the other four items are taxed at 10 per cent of the wholesale price. If we assume that the wholesale prices for these items are 30 per cent below final community store prices, the wholesale sales tax that would be levied on this basket of goods would be $9.28, or $241 over a year, which is approximately 2.5 per cent of the final retail price of these goods. In the case of the imposition of a 15 per cent consumption tax, a total of $55 might be expected to be paid in addition each fortnight, which over a period of a year would add up to $1,425. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a bad imposition! In fact, it is an onerous burden that would be put upon these people by the imposition of the 15 per cent consumption tax. We should remember that these are people who, by and large, will be dependent upon welfare payments of some description or government transfers and whose discretionary income would be almost nil. To a large extent, one would expect that probably 70 to 80 per cent of what income they had would be spent on basic items such as food and clothing. These are the people who would be suffering the most under the imposition of a 15 per cent goods and services tax. One might ask&mdash;and certainly the people of the Northern Territory would ask: what compensatory packages has the Opposition proposed which would go anywhere near alleviating this onerous burden?  Is this what Opposition members mean when they say that they have been looking after the bush?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of days, we have noted the sort of suggestions which have been made as a result of the Fightback proposals and the publicity stunts which have been put out by the Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). What I have now come to call the Opposition's Harpic milkshake and Pal diet is what it would have us believe would be a responsible analysis of what the average basket of goods would comprise in the supermarket. I say to Opposition members that what they need to do is look clearly, fairly and squarely at the consumption patterns of those people who live in these remote areas, their income levels, their ability to pay the 15 per cent imposts and how they would suffer. In my view, one can come to only one conclusion: that these people would be severely disadvantaged. I might say that this 15 per cent would, of course, flow across the whole of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many aspects to this proposal which, I think, deserve special attention. Perhaps one of the most insidious is the proposal to cut, as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said today, $10.1m out of expenditure in gross terms, or $4.7m in net terms, from government outlays in terms of the public sector. This, of course, would have an horrendous impact on a community such as the Northern Territory, whose Government is, in large part, dependent upon the expenditure which comes out of the Federal capital. Indeed, the Opposition might also look at the proportion of Northern Territory people who work in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at September 1991, 64,000 of the 154,848 people in the Northern Territory were employed;  42,400 are in the private sector and 21,600 are in the public sector. We have heard again today about the Opposition's attitude towards those people who work in the public sector. We have heard that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) believes that they should be kneecapped&mdash;or cut off at the knees, I think, was the term that he used. Nothing could be more scandalous or shameful than a person who would purport to be the Deputy Leader of the Government attacking the public sector in this way.

It is a scandal that he should even suggest such a thing. In the Northern Territory, a community that is largely dependent on public sector transfers, we are seeing propositions put by the Opposition which would gut the Northern Territory public sector. I might just remind the Opposition that last year we saw an exercise by the Northern Territory Government in cutting back its own expenditure&mdash;ERC cuts. That had a very detrimental impact upon the Northern Territory community. In 1991 these ERC cuts amounted to $108m, and $60m or 55.5 per cent of this was in wages. That is the equivalent of 1,233 jobs. In terms of the multiplier effect that that had on the Northern Territory economy, that worked out to about $290m&mdash;negative in terms of its impact on the Northern Territory economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the Fightback package to its logical extreme, it would propose cutting at least between $46m and $50m in revenue to the Northern Territory government. If we extrapolate this and look at the ERC cuts of $60m, we are probably looking at a loss of at least 500 jobs. Those opposite have put out a pamphlet&mdash;a fraudulent pamphlet, a pamphlet that lies, a pamphlet that is guesswork&mdash;which says that they are going to create two million jobs. Let there be no doubt: the immediate impact of the imposition of the Fightback package, the goods and services tax proposal, on the Northern Territory would be the loss of at least 500 jobs. That is not bad for a document which has been strewn around the Northern Territory in a mailing campaign in the last week and which tells lies. There is no other word for it: lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What defence do we have from those opposite? When the heat was put on today, they attacked the Speaker. There is no doubt that they are scared because they can see the damage that the Government's opposition to their package is doing to them in the community.

I have noted that the debate last night and tonight has been a very wide ranging debate indeed. I want to start off by talking about the proposed development of the CSIRO site at North Ryde, which is a project that is going to cost in the vicinity of $100m. One of the major propositions associated with that redevelopment is the relocation of the food processing division. Last year there was a CSIRO feasibility study into what could happen, and that study reported in January this year. Now the CSIRO has appointed a review of that particular feasibility study, which did suggest that none of the country aspirants for the relocation would be successful.

I will come back to the question of relocation, but I want to talk about the situation regarding the 25,201 political orphans in the Lismore area of the electorate of Richmond. It will come as a great shock to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure, to learn that the current honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) has abandoned the people from the Lismore part of his electorate who elected him, and he has skipped off to the north. I am absolutely appalled because he shot through like a Bondi tram. He has left in the lurch 25,201 electors who voted him in as the honourable member for Richmond. He has now closed his office in Lismore and gone back to the northern part of his electorate. In fact, in what I consider to be an irresponsible dereliction of duty, he wrote on 20 February 1992 to the residents that he has abandoned. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Resident,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you probably know, the boundaries for the Federal electoral divisions in New South Wales have been changed by the Australian Electoral Commission. This means that at the next election you will be in the Federal electorate of Page, which is represented by Harry Woods, MP. I have been pleased to have represented the people of Lismore as your local Member of Parliament for almost two years. My job as your local MP has been both informative and rewarding and I would like to thank you for your support during that time.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a ta-ta letter, Mr Deputy Speaker. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the member for Page, Mr Harry Woods, MP. His office is situated at 82 Prince St Grafton and he will soon be opening an office in Lismore. I know that Harry and his staff, David, Annette and Linda will be pleased to help you with any Federal issues or concerns you may have.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a member of this Parliament saying goodbye to 25,000 of his constituents and walking away and leaving them because the redistribution at the next election is going to change the boundaries. I must say that I believe this is a disgraceful and absolutely outrageous piece of behaviour. His letter went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Harry has been an active member of the business and wider community of the north coast for many years and understands the issues that concern us here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where the honourable member for Richmond is just shooting through, as I said before, like a Bondi tram, in what I believe is an act of desertion. He is just abandoning ship and neglecting 25,000 of his electors. Of course, he has passed the ball to another member of this Parliament who is not the member representing the people of Lismore, namely the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), who in this case is a usurper. I believe there is a great deal of impropriety involved, if not, perhaps, even illegality. I do not know, but certainly it is improper for the honourable member for Page to go and be a squatter in the Federal seat of Richmond, which is not in his electorate. As I believe he will be beaten at the next election, he will never represent the people of Lismore in any electorate. But there he is like a cuckoo in the nest. And he has opened an office there. I have had a number of complaints from people in that area who say that they cannot get in touch with their own member. I even had a report today from a woman who rang the Lismore office of the honourable member for Page, shop 14, Star Court Arcade, Molesworth Street, Lismore, and this lady took notes of her conversation. It was not recorded, of course, so they may be slightly inaccurate, but she assures me that she has the thrust of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conversation went like this: `Is that the office of Neville Newell, Federal member for Lismore?'. `No, this is Harry Woods's office'. `Isn't Mr Newell my Federal member? I live just outside of Lismore'. `No, Harry Woods has taken over Lismore now'. What a disgrace. The lady who spoke to me said, `When did that happen? There hasn't been an election'. The answer was, `Quite a while ago. I'm not sure, but months ago'. This is Federal members of this Parliament playing ducks and drakes with their electorates, passing out bits to themselves. The next question was, `Is this Lismore office operating every day?'. `Well, we are supposed to be open every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. This isn't always so as we are supposed to be manned by volunteers, but they are not very reliable and we are doing the best we can coming up from Grafton'. The final question from the woman who contacted me was, `I'm confused. Who is my Federal member? I've been to Mr Newell in the past to help me'. It was suggested, `Harry Woods has taken over from Mr Newell, but if Mr Newell has your file perhaps you should contact him in Tweed Heads'. </PARA>

As I said earlier, I am concerned about the fact that the Public Works Committee has made a recommendation that the CSIRO should relocate its food research laboratory to Wagga Wagga. I know that the Federal members from that area are very pleased about that, but I am concerned that the Committee in examining the situation interviewed people from Wagga Wagga but did not invite opinions from anywhere else. I know that the very reasonable answer will be that it was advertised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have been much happier if the Committee had invited other aspirants to give evidence as well, because the Committee has brought down a recommendation that it believes that the food research laboratory of the Division of Food Processing can operate effectively in a non-capital city location. I certainly believe that is the case. I take this opportunity to speak on behalf of Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour, because both communities have been very active in seeking the relocation of this laboratory and the division. Both John McGahn and the Hastings Municipal Council have been very active. They have had a lot of work done on submissions. In the Coffs Harbour area, coordinators of the submission were headed by Mr Graeme McDougall, who did an enormous amount of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the feasibility study reported in January, a review committee has been set up, and I believe that all the other aspirants should have the opportunity of making additional submissions.

I say too that, with the advent of fibre optics, the divisions of distance are being wiped away. It would be appropriate for the Committee to have another look at the situation, but it would certainly be appropriate for the CSIRO review committee to look at all the other aspirants for the relocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to something that was raised with me by a great friend of mine, Mr Stan Harris of Wauchope, a regular correspondent who keeps me on the ball in many ways and keeps me informed in many ways, too. I am very grateful to him that he drew to my attention an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 23 March 1992 with the headline, `Health Insurance Deal Under Fire'. In this Parliament when we hear the word `deal' we know it has something to do with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information in this article indicates that Medibank Private and the Public Sector Union have done a deal for the provision of health insurance to union members and their families at substantial discounts. I am very much afraid, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what we are seeing here is the setting up of two Medibank Privates&mdash;one for special groups such as the Public Sector Union and one for ordinary citizens such as you and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an announcement by the 107,000-member Public Sector Union that it had entered into an agreement with Medibank Private to provide union members and their families with tailored health and hospital insurance plans at a discount of about $15 a week on normal family premiums. Of course, this arrangement is not available to other fund members. This means that, if one is not a public servant, in terms of Medibank Private one is a second-class citizen. I think it should be asked: why is there this discrimination? That $15 a week is virtually a gift of $800 a year. Seventy five per cent of the Australian work force are not members of the PSU, and this arrangement is not available to other fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested that, because of Medibank Private negotiating this deal, there is likely to be&mdash;and I think it is a reasonable assumption&mdash;an all-out recruiting war between insurers trying to do deals with large employers and employee groups at cheap prices. I do not believe that that will be in the best interests of the citizens of Australia. If Medibank Private or any other provider of health insurance services can provide them at $15 a week less, it should be able to do it for all of its clients. I can see no equity and no justice in the proposition that, because one happens to belong to a certain organisation, be it a trade union&mdash;I am not union bashing&mdash;or any other group, one will get an $800 gift at the expense of other Australians. I take this opportunity to make a significant protest about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point concerns second-hand Japanese car engines coming into Australia. I want first to refer to a press release by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator John Button, dated Monday, 2 December 1991, in which he said the Government was not willing to let cars forced off the road in Japan by tough registration laws there to undermine the Australian industry. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importers planning to bring these cars into Australia must realise we will not allow second-hand imports to jeopardise the local industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button said he was also concerned that consumers could buy one of the second-hand imports without realising the potential problems they could face. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not convinced that people buying these cars would have access to a full range of spare parts.</PARA>
<PARA>And so he went on. My concern goes beyond the second-hand cars to the second-hand engines. I want to quote briefly from a Government publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Importing Vehicles to Australia</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian vehicles are amongst the safest in the world. We have a system of checking vehicles to make sure they have very high safety standards. These are in accordance with the uniform national standards for all vehicles which are the Australian Design Rules (ADRs).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also insist on strict environmental controls for vehicles in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course they do. And so they should. I certainly believe in competition and I am quite happy for importers to bring in second-hand Japanese motors, provided they are on the level playing field&mdash;to use the current phrase&mdash;and they are subject to ADRs, the same as anything else. But I do not believe this is the case. The document goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, which came into effect on 1 August 1989, makes it an offence to import a new or secondhand vehicle unless:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">it meets the safety and emissions standards applying to vehicles to be used on Australian roads.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been suggested to me that, while that is the legal situation regarding an engine in a second-hand car, it is not being applied to second-hand engines coming in by themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is of some concern. The document concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an offence to sell a vehicle which does not meet the ADRs or which is not fitted with a compliance plate and such action may attract a penalty of up to $12 000.</PARA>
<PARA>If it is an offence to sell a car that does not meet the compliance regulations, I believe it should also be an offence to sell a second-hand imported engine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that more than 66,000 second-hand engines entered Australia last year and they are still coming in at the same rate this year. The ABS has recorded that 35,859 units were imported in the financial year to January 1992&mdash;that is, in seven months. So that level of importation is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly know that the consumers who need a second-hand or a reconditioned engine want a cheaper job. But other factors are involved. Something like 300 engine reconditioners are operating around Australia and they provide a lot of employment. According to the figures I have been given, because 66,000 second-hand engines are coming in there is the possibility of something like 1,400 jobs being lost every year, which is not appropriate. The other point is that if 66,000 second-hand engines are imported from Japan and they go into cars here which have crook engines, it means that 66,000 engines are not reconditioned and are dumped in garbage dumps right around Australia. I think that is a great waste. My main point is that the consumers should get a fair go. But that fair go for consumers does not apply only to price; it applies to quality, emissions control and other very important factors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use this debate on the Supply Bills to talk about the most important element of the One Nation statement: investment in national infrastructure. Australia is only just starting to emerge from a severe and prolonged recession. Substantial government action to stimulate renewed economic activity is therefore essential. The only debate during the last few months has been about the extent of the stimulus. It is also generally accepted that part of the stimulus should be increased infrastructure investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a refreshing change from the unrelenting advocacy by some groups, particularly the Opposition, of cuts in public outlays during the 1980s. Of course, the Opposition, astonishingly, wants to continue those cuts at present. Commonwealth and State governments have been under constant pressure to reduce their outlays. Now, however, there is general recognition throughout the community, except on the other side, that the Government must act in counter-cyclical ways to stimulate the economy when it has been so deeply recessed. It is simply not enough to reduce interest rates in the hope that the private sector will renew investment. Fiscal stimulus is also essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure investment is one of the most cost-effective forms of economic stimulus. It has a significant multiplier effect, for there is relatively low leakage to imports. That is a centrally important factor. Most of the inputs are of labour or materials which are produced in Australia. As well, infrastructure contributes directly to the productivity of the private sector by improving the quality of support services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highest priority for government for the next year or two must be to renew economic activity and slow the growth of employment. Unemployment is disastrously destructive for those directly affected and their families and it involves enormous economic waste for the whole community. Despite our openness to the rest of the world, there is much which government and business can do to renew economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One positive by-product of a severe recession is that we are reminded of the interdependence of the public and private sectors. There is now no part of the business, farming or mining communities which does not support government action to stimulate recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Infrastructure is the solid skeleton of community services. Infrastructure has been neglected by many who have not noticed that they are not charged directly for the roads on which they drive, for the subsidies to public transport on which they or their employees travel to work, for the schools attended by the majority of children, or the hospitals used by the majority of the sick. Public infrastructure is neglected by the Opposition in its so-called Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the public infrastructure suddenly collapses or fails, governments are blamed for lack of foresight and investment.

I think the Opposition's failure to show any interest in this subject is a clear example of the cuts it would make through its so-called Fightback package. But the Government has clearly accepted the view that public infrastructure is important, as is shown in the One Nation statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in the middle of a clear explanation of this when I was so rudely interrupted. There is evidence from many countries that a slowdown in public investment can help explain a significant portion of the slump in productivity growth during recent years. That is clearly shown from evidence in the United States and many other OECD countries. The outlays in the One Nation statement are particularly well targeted too, for they show clearly that they would increase public investment, they would increase expenditure on TAFE and they would stimulate private investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things happening at present with our major trading partners, the Asian tigers, is that they accept the same insight. In 1991 both South Korea and Taiwan announced huge new infrastructure programs, and such programs have been under way in Hong Kong and Singapore for some years. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Times</EMPHASIS> reported, for example, that the South Korean Government aims at increasing the total length of roads from 57,000 to 400,000 kilometres and that of its underground railways from 150 to 500 kilometres over the next couple of decades. It plans 60 new power stations, two new airports, a high speed railway system, several new ports and expanded waterworks. In Taiwan, similar programs are under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, true that those east Asian countries are less developed than Australia. Yet if we are looking for lessons from those countries which are growing successfully at present, we could well take note of the priority they are giving to upgrading their infrastructure at a time when there are still great gaps in our own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of maintenance of Australia's infrastructure is also of concern. Declining public investment is linked with declining spending on maintenance. The worst fears of major infrastructure networks falling apart in Australia are probably unfounded, even though there have been some catastrophes in the United States and elsewhere. But Australia's infrastructure networks were begun at about the same time as those in Europe and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid the problem of the gradual inevitable deterioration of infrastructure we need careful planning. Without adequate maintenance infrastructure will deteriorate rapidly. Maintenance and replacement needs will substantially increase during the rest of this decade owing to the age pattern of Australian infrastructure. Unless funding requirements due to ageing can be offset by savings elsewhere, public investment must rise, simply to ensure that existing infrastructure is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says something for the managers of public assets that they have been able to maintain public infrastructure reasonably well with a declining share of national resources. This situation is now changing with increased requirements for rehabilitation and maintenance, and that again is one of the important outcomes of the One Nation statement. Fortunately there is a renewed commitment by the Commonwealth Government to national infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major policy statement was adopted as Party policy at the ALP national conference in June last year. The first step towards implementing that policy was included in the November employment statement. The One Nation statement gives further expression to that policy, to filling gaps, to improving the quality of existing infrastructure and to meeting the need for maintenance and renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the quantity of spending which is important. There are many ways in which the efficiency of delivery can be improved. The establishment of the National Rail Authority can be expected to substantially improve the efficiency of rail freight handling. Corporatisation of some statutory authorities has contributed to improving efficiency through increasing the responsibility of boards and of management for the efficiency of their enterprises. Price systems have been changed in some areas to more closely reflect market conditions, but certainly insufficient account has been taken of externalities, both positive and negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may well be a case for private sector involvement in infrastructure provision in some areas. Privatisation is generally not appropriate, because it would simply involve translating a public monopoly into a private monopoly with the inevitable opportunities that that creates for exploitation of market power. Private provision of infrastructure is inevitably more costly than through the public sector in one regard; the interest rate paid by private infrastructure companies is inevitably higher than that paid by the Government itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when private monopolies are extensively regulated, the difficulty of preventing exploitative prices or reductions in the quality of service delivery is greater than when the enterprises were in the public sector. Private sector competition may well be an option in some areas. It will be interesting to see the impact on Telecom of a second telecommunications network. However, cosy duopolies are scarcely involved in intense competition. In certain areas, user charges and franchising may provide means of mobilising private capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk occurs because the private provision of infrastructure is difficult to scrutinise. Niches can be created which allow unconstrained overpricing. As well, circumstances often set limits to private sector involvement. While it may be possible to charge tolls on bridges, tunnels or on certain roads, that is often not feasible if the service is to be generally available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, infrastructure will be provided more accountably, accessibly and equitably by the public sector. The pressure for efficiency can be maintained through complaints mechanisms, by scrutiny by the public auditor, by Parliament and by consumer groups. This does not rule out business involvement; it just means that such involvement must be evaluated comprehensively, taking account of all costs, benefits and externalities, including accessibility and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be little difficulty in funding substantially increased public infrastructure. That is what the One Nation statement shows. It is entirely appropriate that such public investment should be funded by borrowing, as is most business and domestic investment. The benefits of investment are received for many years. Those who receive the benefits can contribute to the cost of the investment through contributing to interest and loan repayment. There is no risk of public borrowing crowding out private borrowing when there is a recession. In any case, the evidence for crowding out in  Australia is weak at the best of times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> editorialised recently that borrowing for investment by governments is appropriate because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . future generations who enjoy the benefits of that investment will pay for it through higher interest payments.</PARA>
<PARA>This `seems to give reflation a ring of prudence', the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a lower level of government debt than all but one other Western country. To use the flexibility that gives us to increase economic activity when the economy is only just starting to emerge from recession is simply responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, there has been a simple theme for what I have been saying. It was expressed recently by Professor Russell Mathews, who wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When there are so many Australians who desperately need jobs and so many jobs desperately need doing, it does not require great ingenuity to use each problem as a means of solving the other. What is necessary is an end to. . . policies that frustrate all attempts to achieve that result.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have been given in the One Nation statement. That statement is a breakthrough in economic policy because it is directed at improving economic productivity and efficiency in the economy in the areas where government expenditure was needed most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That expenditure was concentrated principally on infrastructure, but also on technical and further education and on stimulating business investment. Those are the three areas which will bring us out of recession. There was a whole series of other minor expenditure outlays which were very well targeted also, but those were the three crucial areas. That statement was ideally targeted; therefore it should be strongly endorsed. </PARA>

The honourable member should also be aware that, during this Government's term in office, it has been successful in increasing sales tax from $3.4 billion in 1983 to $9.4 billion today.

I know that many of the tradesmen around this country do not work overtime because they are taxed so heavily for it that they are worse off as a result. Take the case of a tradesman on $450 per week. After tax, he is on about $9.88 per hour. If he works a Saturday, the first two hours at time and a half and thereafter at double time, his gross goes up to about $627, his tax doubles&mdash;and what happens to his hourly rate?  It drops to about $8.87 an hour. So what does he do?

Today, just on half of all taxpayers pay a tax rate of 38c in the dollar or more&mdash;up to 47c in the dollar. Under our tax proposals, 95 per cent of all taxpayers will pay a tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less. As a result of our lifting the tax-free threshold from $5,400&mdash;something, I might add, that this Government has never done&mdash;to $7,000, an additional 320,000 Australians will drop out of the tax net altogether. </PARA>

I wanted to say this, and very sincerely:  perhaps the most important report in terms of opportunities, whether it be educational opportunities or job opportunities, is now being considered by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) and, therefore, before the Parliament&mdash;the report produced by the Employment and Skills Formation Council, led by Laurie Carmichael, known as the Carmichael report. The Carmichael report follows on from the Deveson report, and the Finn report on young people's participation in post-compulsory education. It proposes a revolution for young people in Australia, in my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gilmore said, `What about unemployment?'. Well, in Chifley, in good times we have been used to unemployment; in bad times, it is even worse. This report hopes to break the nexus. I passionately believe in its recommendations. Essentially, what does it address?  It addresses the issue that, yes, Australia needs more young Australians going on to university. In my electorate I am pleased to say that that is the case. In particular, the brightest of young students look after themselves and do very well. I can give a number of case studies, but I will not take up the time of the House in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My passion has always been a concern for the majority of young Australians. The reality is that, whether they are in the electorate of Gilmore or in the electorate of Chifley or even the electorate of Oxley, Mr Deputy Speaker, the majority of Australians do not see their immediate vocation as being in tertiary education. They legitimately aspire to a job, to traineeships, to apprenticeships, to vocational training. This is the most significant report to address the majority of young Australians and to provide them with real opportunities. I sincerely hope that the Minister, as he has indicated, will allow a parliamentary debate on its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable members a number of things the report tackles. It tackles the issue of whether years 11 and 12 provide a real challenge, a real rigour, for those who are tertiary bound. It suggests that vocational training has a real place in years 11 and 12. Notwithstanding the changes we have seen over recent years, that has not been the case. Those who are not tertiary bound, I regret to say, at present do not have a real place in years 11 and 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report talks about the issue of traineeships and apprenticeships and whether they should be amalgamated, whether they should be competency-based and, I say for the edification of the shadow Minister opposite, it tackles for the Labor Party and the trade union movement the most difficult issue of youth wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be a clever country we should not always equate the clever country with research; we should not always equate the clever country with universities or tertiary education. They in themselves are very important and we want a concentration of them, we want more of them; but, equally, the clever country can be equated with the ordinary men and women of Australia who aspire to jobs in retailing, in banking, on the factory floor and on outback stations. It is a challenge to provide them initially with the recognised skills to enter their trades and to re-skill them throughout their careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, and in the view of the Carmichael report, there ought to be two paths to university: one is the traditional way we know through the various certificates at year-12; the other is through a vocational trade, through articulation in the TAFE system.

We will not allow them to be the flotsam and jetsam of economic upturns and downturns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few things about defence&mdash;a recent love of mine, if I may say so, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. I am very disappointed that the Opposition in its Fightback proposal, which my Opposition colleague the honourable member for Forrest was talking about, proposes that there should be a $500m cutback. Many Australians would be looking at the world scenes and seeing the collapse of European communism and the development of all sorts of nation states, and perhaps even tracking what is happening in America with its severe cutbacks in the defence budget and saying, `Why can't we have that in Australia, too?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that in Defence we are already accustomed to zero real budget increases. Unfortunately&mdash;or fortunately&mdash;there was not the explosion in the defence budget in Australia that we witnessed in the United States. Therefore, there is not really the capacity in the defence budget for those sorts of cutbacks. As the honourable member for Gilmore is in the chamber, I am reminded of what a colleague of his, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), was saying when he was talking about the Opposition's approach to defence in Fightback. As the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, has pointed out, if we institute a $500m cut across the board in the defence budget, we are talking about 15,000 jobs in the Defence Department. The Opposition may say, `Hear, hear! Well done! More, give us more!', but in reality, at the very least, that would involve a cutback of 5,000 in the armed services, in the ADF. Frankly, I do not think we can afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, this Government has adopted some very brave approaches in the defence area. We have adopted the force structure review, which is predicating that we should move more and more of our defence forces north, and we are implementing that. Secondly, we have adopted the commercial support program, which gives effect to two elements: first, that we should be self-reliant; and, secondly, that we should be based in the community. We are allowing private enterprise to provide more and more of the support functions that are currently provided by the ADF. I welcome that; it is a real challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say to Opposition members that there are some 4,000 jobs that potentially will go to the commercial area, and we see something like $300m in potential savings in the defence budget. The Opposition may say that they are considerable benefits, but in reality the greatest benefit will be the change in culture of the ADF and the Defence Department&mdash;and that is incalculable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to contrast what the Government and the Opposition are proposing. The Opposition is saying, `Blanket cuts&mdash;cut out $500m&mdash;a loss of 5,000 uniformed positions'. This is when the ADF and the Defence Department are undergoing considerable change, when the Government has acted on report after report and taken considered positions. Not content with that, in addition the Opposition is saying, `$500m in cuts; 15,000 jobs; 5,000 uniformed jobs'&mdash;and it is saying, `We adopt a bipartisan position on defence'. I know some people in the Defence Department who would be disappointed in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a recent debate in this House about defence, the honourable member for Mayo, whom I mentioned earlier, said that there was an economic brief circulating within the Defence Department that was incorrect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the GST, we have talked about the community; we have seen Question Time after Question Time the dodgy shopping trolleys that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has wheeled out, and I think they have been well and truly demolished.

Not only is the Opposition proposing a $500m cutback, not only is it suggesting that a further 5,000 uniforms disappear, but also it is saying that the Defence Department is zero rated. I point out to the honourable member for Mayo that the section from which he was quoting referred to instances where the public sector is the supplier of goods and services. This is not what concerns Defence. There are few instances where Defence or the ADF is a supplier of services. When it is&mdash;that is, in the defence of Australia&mdash;it does not make a charge; that is what it is funded to do. It is not a private enterprise organisation that knocks on the doors of Darwin city and says, `Hey, we are going to charge you $1m to defend you'. It makes purchases. In my own area of interest, acquisitions and logistics, the Department spends $4 billion a year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Mr McCrann's contention covers one of the two central issues in these Supply Bills and the One Nation statement. As he implies, all these measures are based on the belief that somehow there is going to be a magical growth in the gross domestic product of 4 3/4 per cent in 1992-93.

No such criticism could be levelled at the National Australia Bank Ltd, whose latest quarterly magazine suggested that this forecast by the Keating Government of 4.7 per cent growth rate in 1992-93 is unlikely to be achieved. So we have two very respected commentators challenging the whole basis of the One Nation statement and saying that it will not be achieved in a month of Sundays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the evidence that backs up the claim of the Bank, I would like to look at the forecasting record of the Government. It would be an understatement to say that the Hawke and Keating administrations have not had a good track record in making predictions about government expenditure, revenue and the overall budgetary balance. In 1990-91, asset sales were predicted to be $840m, and they came in at $520m. So that estimate was way off track. Industry development and assistance was budgeted at just under $2,700m, and the actual figure was $4,000m, which is a difference of close to 50 per cent of the latter figure. But the real corker was the anticipated Budget surplus of $8.1 billion, which has whittled down to an estimate of $1.9 billion, and we have yet to see the final figures. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I was relating to the document is that now, in this One Nation statement, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister are prepared to spend more money&mdash;$2.3 billion&mdash;at a time when we are in recession and the Government has taken the Budget into a further deficit. Last August, the Budget deficit for the 1991-92 year was predicted to be $4.7 billion. After the latest revision, the Government now estimates it to be $6.8 billion, which is a rise of $2.1 billion since the Budget was brought down last August. I add that we still await the final outcome, which could be anything. Access Economics has put it in the range of $7 billion to $9 billion, and we wait with interest to see what the final figure is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the cuts in personal income tax that the Government is to bring in are not funded from any careful reductions in government expenditure, there will be little overall benefit to individual Australians. In contrast, the Fightback package incorporates appropriate reductions in government spending. For instance, why do we have the CES and Social Security staff located in different buildings when the counter services that they offer could be combined? Part of our proposition under Fightback is to make such savings in some of those government instrumentalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As sad as it is, while Australia overall is going through a severe recession, the Kirner Government in Victoria is ensuring that whatever little glimmers of hope may appear in other States, such as New South Wales, from time to time are obliterated by negative indicators emanating from Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the Federal Government claims that the One Nation statement will merely involve a small addition to national spending; on the other hand, it suggests that the One Nation statement will deliver a great stimulus to the Australian economy. It really cannot have it both ways. It is just saying that it is going to spend a little bit; but all the rhetoric of Prime Minister Keating is that this will restore confidence and bring the whole economy back to a more buoyant state. We know what happened in Victoria when Premier Kirner and Premier Cain adopted these tactics of spending more and more money&mdash;so much so that I think it will take 15 years for Victoria to recover from its absolutely horrendous debt levels. It is beyond belief that anyone will ever overcome that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raw figures show that nearly one million Australians are unemployed. The suggestion that the Government is putting forward is that Australia is sharing the pain of world recession. Of course, this does not compare very well with the eight leading OECD nations from the March quarter 1990 to the December quarter 1991. It does not put Australia in too good a light. Over that period, Australia's unemployment rate increased from 6 to 10.4 per cent. Let us get it clear; it rose from 6 to 10.4 per cent. That sharp increase was exceeded, amongst the industrialised nations, only by Sweden, where the rate tripled from a very low level of 1.3 per cent to 3.2 per cent. Britain, New Zealand and Canada all recorded increases, but none as sharp as Australia's in the deliberately engineered recession that we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst features of Labor's mismanagement of the economy has caused many Australians to have less optimism for themselves and their children. The number of discouraged job seekers has risen over the last three years from 84,000 to 138,000, which is a rise of 60 per cent over a normal term of office for a Federal government. What we are seeing here is that people who were hoping to seek jobs now do not have the confidence to go to the job agencies and put in an application. They lack the confidence and the ability even to seek out a job. They know they are in a hopeless situation and that to go down to the CES or to respond to any job vacancies that are in the newspapers is just not a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such an environment, many commentators offer advice as to what action the Government should take in order that the economy can begin to recover. I remind Government members that the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Don Sanders, said on 26 March that forecasters have overestimated the strength of the predicted upturn, and on a number of occasions we on this side of the House have endorsed those remarks. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others have been saying for months that the economy is on the verge of an upturn, yet we do not see any upturn. In fact, we see the economy bubbling at a very low level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Institute of Chartered Accountants conference at Lorne, in my electorate, the Commonwealth Bank's chief credit controller, Mr Paul Rizzo, had this to say&mdash;and it is a very interesting comment:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government had a golden opportunity with its statement to take the bull by the horns and abolish the plans for the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;the superannuation legislation was introduced into the Parliament only this afternoon&mdash;which will mean that an extra impost will be enforced on those businesses with payrolls under $500,000 from 1 July. Of course, the smaller businesses do not really save very much from the deferral of their employer funded rate increase, because under a Labor Government they would be paying up to 12 per cent in a compulsory superannuation levy by the year 2000. It is quite a remarkable suggestion that that extra burden will be imposed on employers by this Labor Government. This one single measure and impost could result in the loss of up to 70,000 jobs. That figure has been well accepted by the commentators and by those people who have made some judgments on the effect on business of paying these quite massive amounts of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Government's so-called commitment to social justice, which is really a threat? It will be the same situation as that which arose in 1981 and 1982 when the metalworkers pursued the fantastic rise in wages. Of course, the consequences were that great numbers of people were put out of work at that time. We have a similar situation because this impost of superannuation will put large numbers of people out of work around the nation in a subtle way. The extra people will not be put on and those jobs will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative is the coalition's emphasis on voluntary agreements helping to make a true understanding between the employees' contribution from their own efforts and what the employer contributes to business operations. This is a big change under which the workers and management can get a proper understanding of their own contributions to profitability. Employees of Australia are sensible enough to understand that the employers no longer have a pot of gold. They understand in the superannuation issue that they just cannot continue to pay superannuation, Workcare and holiday loading at 17 1/2 per cent, which adds up to 45c to 50c in the dollar for every wage paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the One Nation statement does not come to the realisation that employers can no longer stand these imposts on their ability to create jobs. The One Nation statement makes the claim in its summary documents that our reforms to industrial relations have been the most constructive steps our country has taken since the war. What a remarkable statement by the Labor Government. It suggests that it has brought about changes to industrial relations. The facts are that Australia's productivity growth through the middle 1980s has been less than 2 per cent per year. The Government's new found enthusiasm, what is called enterprise bargaining, has not come to fruition, because only 47 workplace agreements have been put in place, as the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Cook) has admitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy is to have enterprise agreements administered and organised by the workers and management. It is easy to see why there has been so little change. The Government has insisted that it allows only the unions to represent employees, and is directed by the head office bureaucrats of the unions so that it can control the outcomes of these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newspapers today have been full of plans about the suggestion to bring subcontractors within the ambit term of `employee'. Despite the Minister's claim, this measure has the potential to increase housing prices and reduce the efficiency of Australia's domestic housing industry. It really is a pathetic attempt to pander to union muscle and, more importantly, it is an attempt to hold the declining number of union members. Union members are very clear in their view that they do not wish to join unions. If we look at the figures, we see that union numbers are declining and workers are leaving the unions in droves. During the reign of Prime Minister Hawke, a former President of the ACTU, union numbers declined in Australia. What a remarkable epitaph for that particular Prime Minister. History will write it up that the union movement was a declining force in those years of a reigning Labor Government under Prime Minister Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is falsely based on growth rates. It is optimistic of the way in which Australia will turn around. It is a big spending, bankcard document which depends on spending more money to raise a sense of confidence here in Australia to bolster a failing government. In this way the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is hoping that the Australian people might start to support him, because they know that the recession we had to have was caused by the Prime Minister himself in his eight years as Treasurer.

But now we see that ministerial statements are not made; in fact half of Question Time is taken up by Ministers virtually announcing policy and making statements, rather than doing it on a more appropriate occasion.

If one considers the surveys of opinion that have been taken, and takes that as a guide to the way in which the public has regarded this statement, it has done very little to restore confidence within the community. Of the numerous polls I have seen, only one poll has suggested that confidence in the Government may have increased as a consequence of the One Nation statement. Of 188 responses to the Australian Chamber of Manufactures survey of members, 84 per cent of the respondents viewed One Nation unfavourably; 92 per cent said it would not encourage investment, and 93 per cent said it would not increase employment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the One Nation statement could be more aptly entitled `One Broke Nation'. Australia's foreign debt now stands at a net level of $145 billion. For many Australians an amount of $145 billion may simply sound like a large figure. Let me put that in understandable terms for Australians. It amounts to approximately $8,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. In 1983 this debt was just $23 billion, or less than $1,500 for every Australian.

Of the total net debt of $145 billion, nearly one third, or some $50 billion, is owed by the public sector. The reality is that this figure disguises the true level of public sector borrowings in Australia, as the gross foreign borrowings by Australian governments and instrumentalities are a staggering $81 billion of a total gross debt of $183 billion. </PARA>

First of all, international interest rates have fallen; and, secondly, because of the recession we are in, Australia's repatriation to foreign-owned companies has also fallen. Because both of these factors should be expected to increase again as the nation comes out of recession&mdash;no matter how slowly&mdash;we will need to continue to maintain a trade surplus in this country if we are to reduce our foreign debt. Yet there is little in the One Nation statement to provide the confidence that this outcome will eventuate. If one reads the background papers, at best it seems to be put as an outside chance. There is the ongoing problem that, even in a recession, Australians consume imports at an increasingly worrying level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, instead of increasingly vitriolic personal attacks on the Leader of the Opposition and tilts at diversionary issues like some Don Quixote suffering from mid-life crisis, the Prime Minister has a responsibility to address our real economic situation. As I said at the outset, the fact that the Government has hardly debated One Nation and is preoccupied with the Fightback package underlines the Prime Minister's inability to deliver much more than jibes written by highly paid speech writers. Is this what we have come to expect of the Prime Minister?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the wide ranging debate that is allowed under the Supply Bills, I would like to bring to the attention of the House tonight what I believe is a good example of the reason why Medicare and private health insurance cannot exist together. I have said before that they are a disaster and I have a case here which I think proves my point. I have a letter which one of my constituents has written to me. I will not read out all of the letter, but I will read out some of the more relevant points. My constituent says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't see how a person could get such a large account when the fact is that if I had had no private cover I would have got the operation cost free.</PARA>
<PARA>I think a number of things can be said about that letter. My constituent is right: if she did not have private health insurance she would not have received a bill. She took out extra health insurance and she received a bill from the anaesthetist which she says is $1,283 over the schedule fee</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to bring to the attention of the House some of the charging practices of these people. I have the bill which was sent to my constituent. Item No. 533, which has a schedule fee of $271, attracted a charge of $1,155.70. Another example is item No. 97, which has a schedule fee of $42.50 but which attracted a charge of $180.75&mdash;more than 400 per cent higher than the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent knows that by taking out private health insurance she will not be covered for bills. She does not get extra financial coverage, but she is able to buy access. That is very important, especially for older people who do not like to wait. This is a pressure that sections of the medical profession can exert upon Australians. They can say, `If you have private health insurance you can have the operation straight away, but if you don't have private health insurance then you could wait three or four years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anaesthetist I am talking about&mdash;I have never mentioned doctors' names before, but I think this one deserves a mention&mdash;is Dr Sodhy. In contrast with the anaesthetist&mdash;who was not picked by my constituent and who never discussed his fees with my constituent&mdash;the surgeon, whose name is Michael Anderson, charged her the schedule fee and she got the lot back. There is the contrast: the surgeon who actually knows the patient, talks with the patient and knows the financial position of this full-rate pensioner renting privately, charges the schedule fee; the anaesthetist, who never talks with the patient, charges&mdash;on my reckoning at least&mdash;about $1,400 above the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent came to see me and she was very distressed about this situation. I wrote to Dr Sodhy pointing out her financial position and asking him to drop his charges on top of the schedule fee so that she would be fully covered by Medicare and her private health insurance. His response was not to write me a letter, but to get his secretary to ring my constituent, accusing her of being ungrateful and saying how upset Dr Sodhy was that she had come to see me about this massive overcharge that he had inflicted upon her. He offered to cut that overcharge in half. He said, `If you send me a cheque today for $740, I'll accept that as full payment and I won't sue you. But if you don't send it to me I will take you to court'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one knows elderly people, one would know how upset they would be at such a threat. She rang up one of her friends, who is 82 years old, and borrowed the money. Her 82-year-old friend drove over and gave her $740. My constituent, on two walking sticks, walked down to the Commonwealth Bank in Armadale, got the cheque for $740 and sent it in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I heard about this, I phoned my constituent and I said, `What sort of an impact will this have on your lifestyle?'. She said, `Well, I've cut back as far as I can. I just can't afford to buy petrol for my car'. So now she has to get her daughter to do the shopping for her. Of course, if she cannot afford petrol for the car, she cannot afford to use the car, so there are no more outings for the pensioner and her husband. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really shows that these charges are having a significant impact on low income earners, to the extent that they are actually lowering the standard of living significantly for people who are charged excessively by medical specialists only because they have private health insurance. I say to the anaesthetist that I know the standard of his living will not rise by as much as my constituent's will fall because of this incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to take out that private health insurance with HBF costs her $114 a month&mdash;so there is a double sting in this. With the meagre income they have, they had to pay the hospital, the HBF insurance and then they had to pay the $740, which my constituent had to borrow, using savings from her pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always said that the answer is one national health insurer. We have to get rid of private health insurance; it is an absolute disaster. The Opposition, faced with the fact that more and more people are choosing to get out of private health insurance, wants to drive them back in again. But we should get rid of it. There is no equality of access under private health insurance and it is not based on the ability to pay&mdash;the two characteristics of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish on this note: I think the case I have presented to the House tonight illustrates the impact that the present health insurance arrangements are having on people in Australia, particularly people on low incomes such as my constituent. If I were Dr Sodhy, when I got this cheque for $740 I would put it in an envelope and send it back to the pensioner. He will know who I am talking about. If he did that, he would have a modicum of decency and I for one would applaud him. </PARA>

In particular, I was urging that something meaningful be done about our unconscionably high unemployment levels, and arguing that that meant the Government had to increase public expenditure to create jobs through economic growth.

Wage-earners' real incomes dropped from 62 per cent of the gross domestic product to 58 per cent over eight years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will tell the honourable member for Bruce where they went. Instead, company executives led by the likes of the honourable member's heroes, Holmes a Court, Bond and Skase, indulged in an orgy of asset inflation, takeovers and many other money games. Taking advantage of the deregulated financial system, they, with the indulgence of the banks, engaged in a corporate borrowing spree that saw our external debt ratio rise by a factor of three. Predictably, the boom busted and we headed down the well-worn cyclical path to recession that so characterises free market economies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stark truth is that our corporate sector failed to support productive development, particularly in our export industries, and that caused external debt to rise to impossible proportions, which in turn forced the Government to impose high interest rates. However, it was the Government's own rationalist commitment to an inflation first policy that proved to be so electorally damaging by reducing business investment and blowing out employment. </PARA>

By the time the economic indicators tell us that the policy is working, the intervening period of high rates has laid waste to demand, causing growing unemployment, business bankruptcies and low levels of business investment. That is why I am very pleased to see the turn in Government economic policy with the One Nation statement, which takes the Labor Party back to where it has been for many years, and where it has always been successful, with good old traditional Keynesian economics. We have seen a tremendous resurgence in our support from the community, and I think we will continue to see it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with some fascination to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker), because I was not sure whether he was talking about the Supply Bills or the economic statement. It seems that he has confused the two, truncated the debate and moved on to the next Bill. One thing that the honourable member from the Left of the Labor Party seemed to have great difficulty in understanding was that there is still a massive unemployment problem. We have 10 1/2 per cent unemployment. If we add to that those who have stopped looking for a job and those who cannot get the work they want, we see that, according to today's figures, unemployment is probably closer to 17 per cent. That is the legacy of the economic policies of this Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the honourable member for Robertson to talk about Keynesian or neoclassical economics, but the fact remains that the Government of which he is a member is responsible for the current mess that we have in this country. Government members cannot walk away from it just by talking about the February economic statement. I think it is worth also pointing out to honourable members that the economic statement that came out at the end of February was the fourth attempt by the Government to bring out a statement that was meant to turn around the recession we had to have&mdash;the worst recession in 60 years; the recession that the Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer, seemed rather proud to say he had inflicted on this nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted that the honourable member seemed to have great difficulty in supporting some of his own colleagues. It is fascinating to watch the way the Labor Party is so quick to disown a former very senior economic Minister, the former Minister for Finance. It seems that, as soon as it becomes convenient, he is dispensable. I look at this in some amazement, because this is quite contrary to former Labor Party practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to get a member of the Labor Party to bag former Prime Minister Whitlam, yet by any measure until now most Australians would rate him as the worst Prime Minister we have seen, certainly since World War II. He was the engineer and architect of many of the problems that we have had over the last few years. It was under Whitlam that we had the incredible 25 per cent blow-out of wages in 1974. It was Whitlam who ignited the fire of inflation that took years to bring under control. It was Whitlam who showed the incredible economic irresponsibility of running up debts and increasing the level of taxation in this country at a rate that hitherto had never been seen in peacetime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, in speaking on the subject of urban consolidation, I pointed out that urban consolidation as a policy had failed. It failed because of the false ideas that housing density was related to urban sprawl, that there is an economic advantage in the concept of greater utilisation of spare infrastructure, that higher densities produce cheaper housing and that urban consolidation can be imposed on the community without public support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have governments chased these rainbows; they have ignored the fundamental causes of city sprawl. Firstly, the main determinant of urban form is transport. While private car usage is encouraged and subsidised with no relation of cost to usage, as has been the case since the Second World War, then cities must sprawl and densities must reduce. With a plethora of subsidies to encourage private transport at local, State and Federal levels of government, there is no way to stop Australian cities developing on the Los Angeles model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are subsidies provided for parking, fuel, registration, company cars, licences and registration, but the high capital costs of cars in relation to low fuel costs break any relation of cost to usage. Personal and land use decisions are thereby massively distorted. The overdependence on the use of cars then causes an acceleration of demand for land required for roads and parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction of sales tax on cars recently introduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent was worth while in terms of its effects on reducing the age of Australia's car fleet. This means an increase in jobs, improved road safety and less pollution and as such it is welcome. It is a pity, however, that the opportunity was not taken to make the reduction in revenue neutral by putting 1c on the price of fuel to improve the imbalance of the cost to usage relationship. Better still, all taxes on the capital costs should be removed in a phased program and transferred to fuel taxes. While ever there is little relation of cost to usage and the general subsidies remain, all land uses and transport decisions will remain distorted and sprawl will continue apace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, non-residential urban land use, both private and public, is virtually in a state of anarchy. Government departments, State and Federal, and the commercial world have operated in isolation pursuing their own interests. There is no overall land use plan related to transport and no mechanism to implement and control such a plan even if it existed. As a result, there is little relation of where people live or work or the location of public facilities. For example, if one wants to keep an ever expanding international airport in the centre of a city occupying an area where 200,000 people could live, then it is foolish not to expect urban sprawl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, while tax systems distort land use and transport, encourage the leaving of idle land, subsidise fringe infrastructure and governments reduce infrastructure spending while running the fastest rate of population growth in the OECD countries, then urban sprawl and deterioration must continue. Minimising of urban sprawl and all associated problems can only be achieved by a coordination of policy at the three levels of government arrived at with public support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Substantial improvements can be made by such mechanisms as traffic limitation policies, investment in public transport, decentralised employment locations, conservation of residential land, flexible planning controls, tax reform, subsidy removal, a coordinated land use and transport policy, high density centres and sub-centres. All of this requires a reversal of the continuing reduction of urban infrastructure spending of the last few decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, however, there is a continuation of the present trend to privatising of roads, creating a group of interests with the incentive to increase private car usage, then urban sprawl will accelerate. It has to be recognised that, given people's basic desire for more, not less, space, the equally strong desire for personal mobility and high population growth rates, added to conceivable rates of infrastructure spending, there is little alternative to continuing relatively low density cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless a great deal can be done if governments are prepared to address the real problems. The better cities program is at least a start, but if it avoids the issues and is frittered away on a handful of relatively insignificant individual projects spread over a dozen cities and five years, together with a shoal of consultants, overseas trips and reports, then it will be meaningless. </PARA>

These people believe that Australia should return to the dark ages and adopt an immigration policy in favour of predominantly white Anglo-Saxons. It is an argument based purely on racist beliefs and should be exposed for the fraud that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years Australia's immigration policy has generated much debate. Often this debate has been quite heated and passionate. I fully support rational and informed debate, yet I reject most strongly those who espouse racist doctrines. In recent times these people have refined their argument in order to conceal their true motives. We now have these people using both the environment and unemployment as issues to legitimise their racist arguments. They argue that Australia should reduce its migrant intake because it is ecologically unsustainable. When pressed, these people are basically concerned only with excluding non-English speaking, non-white migrants. They are not at all concerned with protecting the environment but rather with exploiting the issue to further their own ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fact that we must never lose sight of when discussing Australia's immigration policy is that we are dealing with people, not facts or figures or statistics&mdash;people who look to Australia with hope and optimism; people who leave behind their family and friends because they believe Australia offers them more hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the product of a migrant family, I am well aware of the difficulties that face migrants. My father migrated to Australia in 1926. Like so many of Australia's early migrants, he could not speak the language and had few possessions. My parents raised 10 children here: five have obtained university degrees, three have trade qualifications, one is a secretary, and the youngest is currently studying at university. My family is not unique. It is but one of the many millions of migrant families that highlight the benefits that flow from immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My parents and migrants of their generation can consider themselves fortunate because it is unlikely that they would have been able to migrate to Australia under the present guidelines. Having no skill, no formal education and no knowledge of the language, my parents and many others like them would have been denied entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History records the valuable contribution of these people to Australian society. The massive levels of immigration post-World War II helped Australia achieve a rapid rate of growth and expansion. Our society has been enriched enormously by our migrant community and the interchange of different cultures. Regrettably, these migrants were not always welcomed by a society still clinging to the facade of the White Australia policy. Racial abuse of the Greeks, Italians, Maltese and Lebanese was prevalent. What is significant, though, is that the first and second generations of these migrant families have made an enormous contribution to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An immigration policy must above all be based on people and compassion. We must never lose sight of the fact that our immigration policy must find the balance between the contribution that both skilled and family migrants can make. We should be doing all that is possible to assist those people who look to Australia for a better future. We should not let lack of skills or formal qualifications act as an impediment to re-uniting families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can be rightly proud of the success and benefits which have flowed from immigration. We must not allow the narrow-minded racist attitudes of a few to influence policy. Indeed, we must ensure that, above all else, our immigration policy does not discriminate on grounds of race or wealth, and does not reinforce the discrimination already suffered by some groups in their country of origin but benefits those who most need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignorance breeds fear and conservatism. Regrettably, much of the debate concerning immigration is driven by fear and ignorance, which the opponents of our present policy have deliberately sought to exploit and manipulate. History will ultimately pass judgment on our deeds and actions. It will expose those who espouse populist politics and stand for the latest fashion and condemn those who lack principle and conviction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two of my constituents, ex-service couple Jack and Hester Mews of Two Rocks, have experienced problems with their defence service home loans, or DSHL, portfolio for quite some time now. It was in June last year when I first brought to the attention of the House the fact that the Government had reneged on its commitment to DSHL recipients that they would be no worse off as a result of the transfer of the defence service home loan portfolio from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to Westpac Bank in 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June Mr and Mrs Mews were in the middle of legal proceedings with the bank. An amazing thing happened as a result of those proceedings. Mrs Hester Mews's account with Westpac was debited with Westpac's legal fees. Westpac also charged an $80 discharge fee in addition to the fee levied by the Titles Office for the discharge of a mortgage. Under the Department of Veterans' Affairs, this discharge mortgage fee was not levied. Granted, these fees have now been removed by Westpac for Mr and Mrs Mews, but the matters of principle that affect the ex-service community around Australia which Mr and Mrs Mews have fought for remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mews pays around $73 a month on a two-tier DSHL mortgage that stood at $10,925 in September of last year. His loan is levied at two levels of interest: 3.75 per cent on $8,476 and 7.25 per cent on $2,449. Mr Mews says that, when the DSHL portfolio was with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the threshold over which the higher interest rate was charged was $12,000. He finds himself with less than $11,000 to pay off his mortgage, but he is still paying the higher interest rate on a portion of his loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mews says that there is nothing in the terms of the mortgage to say that he cannot pay off the higher interest bearing account in one payment. However, the bank has other ideas. If Mr Mews wanted to pay some of his mortgage off in addition to his monthly repayments, four-fifths of his payment would go to pay off the amount that the lower interest rate is levied against, and only one-fifth would go towards paying off the amount at which the higher interest rate is levied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Mews argues that the recession has brought the market interest rate down substantially. A bank account with Westpac could therefore be earning less interest than is being levied on some portion of a DSHL account which was originally set up to reward and assist members of the veteran ex-service community in return for their valuable service to Australia. </PARA>

The lady, Mrs Gwen Logan, this year celebrates 50 years of community service in a variety of voluntary organisations and, as part of the recognition of her efforts, she was nominated and awarded the title of Parramatta Senior Citizen of the Year on Australia Day this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Logan is a lady who has lived in Parramatta throughout her life. She is now 76 years of age and, having raised six daughters, she has 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren to whom she is very devoted and with whom she spends a lot of time assisting. Nevertheless, she has found time over the last 50 years to be very active in a variety of community organisations in the Parramatta area. Her efforts and deeds on behalf of many deserving citizens in the community are legendary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of activities that Mrs Logan has been involved in throughout those 50 years includes active periods in parents and citizens organisations at various schools in the Parramatta electorate. She was an active contributor to those organisations at all levels, particularly in craft and handicraft fields and on the fund-raising side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over approximately the past 30 years, she has been very active in the Parramatta Community Services and Information Centre. Indeed, she established the centre in 1967 and has been secretary and directly involved in its development throughout the intervening period. During that time she has helped establish activities such as the home and community care service, the occasional child-care service, the inter-agency service, and Gwennie's market&mdash;which raises significant amounts of money in the Parramatta Festival period. As well as that, she is active in ladies auxiliary activities relating to the child-care service, and even today is still treasurer of the community centre and an active member of the Red Cross Calling appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the celebration of Australia Day in Parramatta this year, the senior citizen's award was again organised by Mr and Mrs Topp in an outstanding way and with the support of many in the community, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parramatta Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. It was the strongly held opinion of all those involved in that exercise that Mrs Logan, as a result of her 50 years of achievement of voluntary service to the people of Parramatta, should be recognised in such a fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Monday Mrs Logan was able to come to Canberra with Mr and Mrs Topp. She had an excellent day here. It is many years since she has been to Canberra. She certainly had not seen the new Parliament House before. She was very impressed with this project. As part of the day she also had the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who expressed both his interest in and appreciation for Mrs Logan's efforts towards the people of Parramatta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Logan is one of many people in our communities who throughout their working and adult life contribute actively, not seeking recognition. It is fitting on an occasion such as this, after someone has achieved 50 years of voluntary service, to have at least a small recognition paid for that effort. On behalf of all the people of Parramatta, I certainly want to say congratulations to Gwen Logan on her great achievement of 50 years of voluntary service to our area and on being the Senior Citizen of the Year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to her efforts and deeds over that period for many needy citizens in the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Shipping and Aviation has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Non-viable ALOP aerodromes are those where the ongoing and cyclical maintenance costs met by the Commonwealth cannot be covered by reasonable user charges. For regular public transport services the maximum reasonable charge was determined as $10 per passenger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As Bairnsdale aerodrome does not receive any regular passenger services and there is limited other traffic it is unlikely that the aerodrome could become viable through the application of reasonable user charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The services provided at the aerodrome do not have a bearing on the eligibility of the aerodrome for a social benefit subsidy. Eligibility for a social benefit subsidy is assessed on the basis of the size of the population served by the aerodrome; the proximity of the community to another population centre which can provide social services such as schools, medical services, etc; the quality of road access to the community and the proximity of the community to an equivalent or higher standard of aerodrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Only in the context of the social benefit criteria outlined in (4).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No assessment outside of the announced criteria was made of any of the aerodromes in the ALOP scheme.  This approach ensured a fair and equitable evaluation of the claims for funding for all aerodromes participating in the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) In the 1990/91 financial year the Commonwealth provided $47,056 in maintenance assistance to Bairnsdale Aerodrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) None.  The aerodrome is owned and operated by the Shire of Bairnsdale and as such the Commonwealth has not made an assessment of the asset value of the facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Total Commonwealth expenditure at Bairnsdale Aerodrome from 1978 to February 1992 is as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are matters for the Shire to consider.  The new arrangements are intended to provide the local community with the opportunity to exploit the commercial potential of its aerodrome to the benefit of the local region. Importantly it gives greater decision making powers to local authorities who are in a far better position to manage their aerodromes to meet the needs of the local community and the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) No.  The issue of distance from West Sale and time taken to complete the journey was not a matter taken into account when assessing the financial viability of Bairnsdale Aerodrome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Access for medical emergencies is one aspect of the social access and equity needs of local communities which have been taken into account in the provision of social benefit subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Bairnsdale does not qualify for a social benefit subsidy would indicate that the community is not solely dependent on the aerodrome for such community services and that alternative means of access to those services is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) The reason for establishing standard criteria for assessment of viability and eligibility for a social  benefit subsidy is to ensure that aerodromes serving local communities throughout Australia are treated equitably. Therefore, communities with similar characteristics to Bairnsdale have been treated in the same manner under the social benefit criteria.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No.  Navy have proposed several measures to conserve funds over the Five Year Defence Plan (FYDP).  The most significant measure proposed is to reduce fleet activity levels by sequentially retaining two ships of the destroyer force (one Frigate in Sydney and one Destroyer Escort in Fremantle) alongside at any one time commencing in Financial Year 92/93.  The ships would rotate with other ships of the destroyer force on, say, a four month basis such that fleet readiness would be retained within that prescribed in the Chief of the Defence Force Operational Readiness Directive (CORD).  Crew Training would still be done by the ships alongside and the opportunity would be taken for their crews to attend courses and take leave.

Planning is proceeding to replace the DDGs with an ANZAC derivative, the first of which will be delivered in about 2006.
