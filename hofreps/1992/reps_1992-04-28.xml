<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Herbert)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Robert Noel Bonnett, OBE, passed away on 21 April this year. He served five terms in this House, from 1966 until 1977. He was a distinguished member for Herbert and a man who brought distinction on this House. He was born in Brisbane on 1 September 1916 and received his primary school education in Brisbane. He then joined his father to work as a timber cutter in north Queensland. He pursued that vocation, also working as a canecutter, until he enlisted in the AIF on 26 March 1941.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He came from a very hard school of timber cutting and cane cutting. He would have lived in circumstances of great deprivation: corrugated iron huts, working in the wet and cutting cane throughout the day&mdash;there are very wet seasons up there&mdash;and he would have earned every penny that he made. I think a lot of the qualities that Duke showed in later life were born out of that fortitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke had a distinguished war record. He served with 2/3 Independent Company, and 2/3 and 2/9 Cavalry, Commando Squadrons, in the south-west Pacific. He was wounded during the war. In fact, that wound figured later when the then Prime Minister, Mr Gorton, was undergoing some stress within his Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke Bonnett attempted to enter State politics in 1961, but failed. He was successful in winning the seat of Herbert in 1966, defeating Ernie Harding, the then sitting member. His was a friendly, easygoing personality. He was able to mix with all people. I recall that he used to drink regularly at the Herbert Hotel in Townsville, a hotel where mainly working-class people drink. I used to see him there very often. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He had an easy familiarity with the working-class people I referred to, including people, such as me, who he knew were out to get his skin. He identified with the ordinary working man, which enabled him to hold that marginal seat for a long time when the Australian Labor Party had expected to win it, particularly in 1972 and 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I formed a friendship with Duke, as he was known, and had a lot to do with him after he retired from politics in 1977. He suffered from a heart condition and was in and out of hospital over recent times. He continued to enjoy the respect of people in the Townsville region until his death. At his funeral at St James Cathedral last Friday, the church was packed. Past members of the House were represented by Mr Clarrie Millar, the former member for Wide Bay, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, Mr Phil Bergin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that in 1978 Duke was awarded an OBE for his services to veterans' affairs and the Parliament. There was no more forceful, strong, articulate supporter of the welfare of veterans than Duke Bonnett. Even until virtually the week before he died, he was still actively involved in assisting veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is survived by his daughters, Kay Hardwick and Josette Morgan&mdash;his son, Duke, predeceased him&mdash;and also by his stepchildren, Carolyn Gillespie, Reg Pollock, Wayne Pollock, Kristine Williams and Glenda Bonnett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke Bonnett was a credit to this House. He was a credit to his country, which he served with great distinction in wartime and in his civilian life. The people of Herbert and the people of Townsville and Thuringowa and I, in particular, mourn his passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to associate myself and the Opposition with this motion and join the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) in expressing our deepest sympathy to the members of Duke Bonnett's family. Duke Bonnett was indeed a most remarkable man. As the honourable member has just said, he was a self-made man; he was a canecutter; he was a timber getter; he was a commando. But he was a very human person who represented the division of Herbert very well indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke Bonnett was an early mentor of mine when I first entered this Parliament in 1975. He was that type of person who undertook to look after the interests of new members and to teach them some of the skills of the House. Duke really knew his way around this place. I also say that the thing that impressed me most about Duke Bonnett when I first entered the House was his dedication to returned servicemen and to the interests of veterans' support organisations, such as Legacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I attended the service last Friday at the packed Cathedral of St James in Townsville it was interesting to see just how many representatives of the returned services organisation were there to pay their last tributes and respects to Duke Bonnett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duke Bonnett was also a very great Liberal, and in the Queensland context did very well indeed to hold the seat of Herbert for the Liberal Party for so many years. Of course, he had been a field officer for the Liberal Party for some time before entering parliament. He was a man who recognised the human condition; he was a man who was prepared to promote Liberal principles; he was a man who was prepared to advocate the right of the individual to work hard and to profit from that hard work. On top of that, Duke Bonnett had very great compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also pay a tribute to him not only for the work that he did with veterans and on the various committees of this place but also for some of the other work that he did on committees. He was one of the Deputy Chairmen of Committees in this House. My first association with him was when the then Fraser Government established the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism. Duke was the first Chairman. I succeeded Duke after he retired from this particular place. It was a very great experience for me at such an early age to be able to head one of those committees. Duke Bonnett taught me a great deal and I will sadly miss him, as I am sure will all Queenslanders and all members of this House. </PARA>

They were not there as part of any imperial defence plan, of any imperial defence proposal; they were there simply at the direction of their Prime Minister to defend this country against invasion from Japan. That is what they were there for. As a result of their bravery, they inflicted the first defeat upon Japanese forces both at Milne Bay and Kokoda and drove them to the coast. Finally, with American forces, they drove them out of Papua New Guinea, and they returned to the Philippines. That was where the battle for Australia was fought. It was fought for the Australian way of life, for the life those people had built here, for Australian ideals. It was not fought about looking to see whether the Union Jack was in the corner of their flag.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as a matter of fact I did. It is true that whilst I was in Japan attending a forum which was put on for me by representatives of Japanese industry&mdash;which was essentially a public forum&mdash;a senior representative of Toyota Japan, Mr Tadao Suzuki, raised a question with me in the context of that forum. He prefaced his question by outlining the tariff reductions which are in place for Australia which will see the level of tariffs reduced to 15 per cent by the year 2000. He went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As investors, we do hope, even if there is a change in government, the tariff level will still be 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope there will be no drastic change of policy. Can you assure us about this?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that it was Toyota's candid and ardent wish that the policy should not be changed. With a restraint for which I am becoming renowned, I responded to the questioner by saying that if I were at home in Australia I would give a rather different answer to the one which I in fact went on to give. I went on to say that we believed that there was a need for certainty about these arrangements as they impinged on large investment decisions to be made in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that we openly tried to encourage the Opposition parties to embrace the major features of the plan for the motor vehicle industry but, essentially, this was a matter for the Opposition. I undertook to pass on to the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;which of course I do now&mdash;the observations of Toyota Australia about these matters because of the way in which its proposals represent a great deal of instability and uncertainty as far as these matters are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not at any time assail the Opposition's program. I told this international audience in Japan what the Opposition had said.

I did it in response to a question specifically about your policies and I gave what I thought was a very polite answer, in a sense, on your behalf. The other thing the Opposition did was go on not only to attack me but also to attack Toyota. Of course, it put Toyota in the same category as the ABC, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Treasury and the Teachers Union: those people who do not agree with the Opposition and, therefore, will not have their arguments embraced or counted on their merits; rather, the critics are simply attacked for having what the Opposition believes to be a wrong view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government has a great deal to be proud of in the way in which it has approached the question of a future for the motor industry in this country. We have only to look at what has happened in the last month, in terms of a pick-up in sales in Australia, to see that the industry is capable of thriving and is capable of having a future in this country. But this is a relatively recent phenomenon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition is on about is totally at variance with what it was on about when it was last in office, when it inflicted on Australia a tariff level of 150 per cent&mdash;a tariff level of protection for the motor industry. The Government has been doing the hard work of reducing those levels of tariff assistance at the same time as the industry becomes more efficient, more capable of competing with imports and more capable of developing its own export markets. This is entirely in contrast with what we saw when the Liberal and National parties were last in office: an increase in protection rather than a reduction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our policies, we now see that there has been a great increase in export opportunities for the motor industry, with exports of the Capri to America, exports of the Magna wagon to America, Europe and Japan, and the creation of something like 400 new jobs to support that development of the Magna wagon in South Australia, the State from which the honourable member for Port Adelaide comes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have provided a future for this industry in a way in which the Opposition clearly does not begin to understand. We have only to observe the remarks of Mr Nasser, from Ford, who said in response to the Opposition's policy of `you don't need tariffs as a result of our policies':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know the argument goes, `don't worry, we'll make sure interest rates, labour rates, inflation and so on are competitive'. That may be the case, but you are still faced with the fact that the Australian industry has a very small volume base. The numbers we have looked at lead us to conclude we would still be uncompetitive with large scale producers to the tune of 20 per cent to 30 per cent even if we could fix all the things which are within the country's control.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we're not a manufacturer it will be because someone has decided Australia doesn't need an automotive industry. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is essentially the policy of the Opposition. It does not want an automotive industry in this country. That is why it is proposing this policy of zero tariffs. It means not only zero tariffs, but also zero cars made in Australia and zero employment in the motor industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members say, `What nonsense', but they clearly do not comprehend the situation which confronts motor manufacturers or component suppliers in this country. They have no comprehension of what the manufacturing industry is confronting or what kinds of circumstances they need to thrive in this country. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that when Toyota says, `Oh, what a feeling', it is not talking about Captain Zero and his plans for its industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to underline the enormous strategic benefit which the stability and economic growth generated by President Suharto's Government has brought to the region and especially to Australia. I had very useful discussions about bilateral and regional issues with President Suharto, Foreign Minister Alatas, Defence Minister Murdani and senior economic Ministers. We also signed a number of bilateral agreements on double taxation, fisheries, extradition and water supply to East Timor. We agreed in principle to conclude new agreements on investment protection, maritime boundaries and cooperation on criminal matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased that President Suharto agreed to my proposal to establish a new ministerial forum which will meet biannually, will include at least two economic Ministers with the Foreign Minister and will be chaired by the respective Foreign Minister. I believe that this will strengthen the institutional framework of the relationship and mean that many more issues are discussed in the normal course of events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On East Timor, I repeated our Government's concern about the 12 November killings but said we thought the Indonesian Government's response had been credible. I emphasised three points: the need for the armed forces' role to be more sensitive; the need for long term reconciliation, taking account of the East Timorese people's economic aspirations; and concern in Australia about using the criminal code to deal with non-violent political protests. President Suharto also responded positively to my suggestion that the dynamic APEC region needed a process of heads of government meetings. He underlined the need to proceed carefully; a view with which I entirely agree.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact is that the Government's position in relation to tariff protection for the sugar industry is consistent with what we said over 12 months ago. It is a very transparent position. In the economic statement in March 1991 the Government said that agricultural products generally will come down to 5 per cent tariff protection by 1996, to bring them generally into line with the manufacturing industry. But, in the case of the dairy, sugar and tobacco industries, whilst we were disposed to head towards that level of protection, we would do it over the longer term and make our final decision depending upon outcomes from the Industry Commission inquiries which had been set up into each of those three industries. In addition, in that March economic statement over 12 months ago, we said that we would continue the phase-down of protection from $76 per tonne to $55 per tonne by 1 July this year. That position remains. The final Industry Commission report has yet to be tabled. The Treasurer will do that some time in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that there was a draft report, well in advance of this final report, which proposed that there should be a zero level of protection for sugar by 1998. Whilst we will have regard to the Industry Commission report, we will not be driven by that report. I have made that position clear in this House before. I have said the same thing in relation to the dairy industry. If Opposition members have any doubts about that, perhaps they should speak to some of their colleagues in the dairy industry to see how I have conducted myself in those negotiations. I hope that it will not be too long before we can announce an outcome in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>What I say in relation to sugar is this: whilst we will have regard to the Industry Commission report, we will not be driven by it. We will consult with industry about the appropriate form of assistance and the means by which we can expand what is already an efficient industry. We do not want to wipe the industry out; we want it to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate this consultation, I am also pleased to advise that I will be asking the honourable member for Hinkler, under his chairmanship, to convene a meeting involving all sections of the industry&mdash;not just the growers&mdash;to come back to the Government with their views on how the industry can be developed. As I said before, if honourable members have any doubts about my bona fides so far as talking to industry is concerned, let them talk to the dairy people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go further and advise the House as to where the coalition stands in relation to its position on sugar and tariff protection generally. We had a pathetic press release issued today by the National Party of Australia in which it is attempting to show that it has sorted out its difficulties. That is an understatement. The second paragraph of its media release states that the Party resolved to emphasise that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> provides for negligible&mdash;not zero only&mdash;tariff policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come to this in a minute, because last night's deal has not solved your problems. We have already seen the first of the lemmings go over the cliff; he is sitting up the back. You have misled and deliberately distorted the position so far as the constituency that you claim is concerned. I have posed this question in this House on a previous occasion. Where were you when industry policy was being talked on and when the honourable member for Barker was developing your position on industry policy? Table 4.1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, which you have reiterated your commitment to, talks about `rural and manufacturing assistance'. They are lumped in together; there is no distinction. It is not like us. We are prepared to take the view that we are disposed to the same direction, but we are prepared to look at the circumstances. You lump them all in together and in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> you say that you will eliminate tariffs. Elimination is not negligible; elimination is zero.</PARA>

What they are saying to manufacturers and trade unions in this country is, `You embrace efficiency and micro-economic reform'; but when it comes to their own pump priming position they are not prepared to assert the same rigour that is required. No wonder you are a laughing-stock in international circles. What you were saying effectively was, `Do as we say, but not as we do'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on this point. There is a question that the Nationals now have to answer. The Leader of the Liberal Party has said negligible is zero in terms of tariff, and we have seen his assertion of authority over the Opposition's front bench, including the resignation from it of the honourable member for Dawson. What you have to decide, having had a look at the report of the Industry Commission, is whether you are saying 5 per cent by the year 2000 or you are locked into zero. That is the question you have to address, because they are irreconcilable differences within your policy. I suggest to those opposite that the Liberal Party does not have a problem; it is the people in the bush who are concerned about a party that claims to represent their special interests, and does not. What they will find increasingly over the next 12 months, as we actually sit down and talk with these groups, is that they will get far more sense out of us than they have been able to get out of you.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It involves the destruction of the national award system, with awards and agreements being replaced, as they expire, by contracts of employment. New Zealand and Australia are two countries which historically have had this unique award system. Some of the elements of the New Zealand provisions of the contracts Act brought in by the Bolger Government speak for themselves. For instance, employees can nominate agents to bargain for them. While these agents can be unions, and the employers have to recognise them, the employers do not have to negotiate with them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Act establishes a minimum wage of only $NZ245 a week, or about $A175 a week. Limited conditions, such as annual leave, are also provided by legislation, but all other conditions must be negotiated. Workers under 20 years of age have no minimum wage protection at all. Changes to social security arrangements mean that if workers resign or refuse a job, they are excluded from receiving the unemployment benefit for six months. Young people with no minimum wage protection can be refused the unemployment benefit for failing to take a job for a few dollars a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, having perused the New Zealand legislation, is certainly of the view that it provides nothing which should be introduced in Australia. I can assure the honourable member for Grey of that fact. The reason for that is that it simply strips away what has been a key element of the social fabric of this nation for virtually all of this century: the provision of minimum wages and conditions of employment which have ensured that in this nation, and in New Zealand until now, there has not been the exploitation of people in poor bargaining positions that is the picture in many other countries which do not have these sorts of minimum protections. We have 80 per cent of wage and salary earners in Australia covered by award provisions. If provisions like the New Zealand provisions were introduced in this country, no such award provisions would apply and many wage and salary earners would clearly be open to exploitation by employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition, of course, has made clear its intention to introduce some such system, though precisely what that system is is far from clear. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he favours a three-stream approach: a centralised award system; a certified agreement system; and a voluntary agreement system. The Opposition spokesman in this area, the honourable member for Bennelong, says it is only a two-stream system: a centralised award system and a so-called voluntary agreements stream, under which conditions that are below the award could be negotiated. We have some conflict between those two views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On his recent trip to New Zealand, the Leader of the Opposition went further and expressed some real enthusiasm for the New Zealand approach of abolishing awards altogether. In that respect, he said quite clearly that the Opposition was considering implementing the New Zealand provisions to abolish awards entirely. In his press conference to New Zealand journalists he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You had a firm date in your policy where beyond a certain date all awards as they fell due, as I understand it, had to be negotiated at the workplace level rather than being a formal award. We are investigating that because I think that type of approach is worth considering.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a clear expression of intention from the Leader of the Opposition to say that those opposite are considering abolishing awards entirely and, therefore, forcing people to go into so-called voluntary agreements. Some voluntariness if there is no award to work under!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, the Leader of the Opposition quite clearly differs from the Opposition spokesman in the area, the honourable member for Bennelong, who subsequently denied that there was any such intention. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on 24 April, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current policy of the Opposition and as far as I'm concerned it will remain the policy of the Opposition, is to have a situation where people have a choice. If both the employer and employee want to continue to be covered by an award they can, if they both want to enter into contractual arrangements governing their conditions of employment etc. they can also.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. According to the Budget Papers, spending on social security and welfare will account for some 34 per cent of the Commonwealth Budget outlays in this financial year. That means about $34 billion out of $101 billion. I am sure that at least most members of this House will agree that that is money well spent on one of the best social welfare systems in the world which will benefit some seven million Australians this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That percentage has increased as a result of cyclical and demographic factors and, of course, it will fluctuate around that figure. But I can certainly say that the Government has no plans, or there is no likelihood, that that figure will more than double, as has been suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. If somebody came along and said that we were going to spend or, indeed, were spending double that amount on social welfare, one would usually dismiss it as a fantasy. But, of course, this Leader of the Opposition, who constantly criticises any comments made by Government Ministers overseas, seems to be quite unrestrained when he gets with his New Zealand mates. He delivered a speech in New Zealand on 22 April in what I can only describe as his high fanatic mood. One can pick up this mood by some of the phrases; for instance, in the paragraph I am about to refer to, he begins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government . . . has become increasingly socialist if you like in Australia,. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that that commendation from the Leader of the Opposition will warm the heart of all our Party members. But he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that came home to me visibly not only in the welfare area when you look at the extent of dependence by individuals on the welfare sector, over 80 cents . . .</PARA>
<PARA>in every tax dollar&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">goes to social security and welfare in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>He made it clear&mdash;it was not just a mistake:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is 80 cents of what you pay in tax goes to look after somebody else's family before you look after your own.</PARA>
<PARA>However you read that statement&mdash;backwards, frontwards or round about&mdash;it is a monumental financial blunder. That would mean we would be spending $80 billion on social welfare and social security in this country. If you take him to mean what he says&mdash;that 80c in the tax dollar is spent on the social welfare budget&mdash;then the social welfare budget would be between $80 billion and $81 billion. That is a mistake by this supposedly economically literate Leader of the Opposition of some $47 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us try to give him the benefit of the doubt and try to save him some of that massive error. Let us include health, about $14 billion; housing and community amenities, about $1 billion; and education, about $8 billion. If you add all of those to it you still manage to get only $58 billion&mdash;that is 57c in the dollar. He is still some $23 billion out. Even if we are generous to him and say that we will include all of those that does produce problems. I do not think anyone in his right mind could suggest that money spent on schools, universities, hospitals or life saving drugs could be classed as welfare or as going to look after somebody else's family before you look after your own. Indeed, I would like the Leader of the Opposition to tell us which Australian family does not benefit from money spent on hospitals, education and medicines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an effort to give him the benefit of the doubt, I have been as generous as I could with his calculations, but it still leaves him with a $23 billion mistake. I have to say that we are beginning to learn from this Opposition Leader that when he is in this hyperbolic mode&mdash;as he obviously was with his New Zealand friends&mdash;and when he gets carried away, any number he utters has to be taken as being wrong until proved right. I have to say that after this performance I am surprised that the GST package is only $4 billion out; I would have expected more.</PARA>

The industry should not be treated lightly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early last year the Australian project proponents visited me seeking support for a demonstration plant to prove the viability of the shale oil extraction technology, using leading edge technology in the attempt. As a consequence of those proposals, the Government accepted a submission from me to exempt shale oil from excise for the demonstration phase of the project. This decision was taken in light of the necessity for the pilot project to be given a chance to establish itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise this as a matter of public importance because we believe the flag is without doubt our most important national symbol. It has been subject to the cheapest type of politicking by this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his own short term politically expedient ends. He has shown in that process an amazing amount of ignorance of history, ignorance of our place in the world and ignorance of the nature and the history of the flag. During this MPI, I will move a motion that will offer this House the opportunity to express its firm and unswerving support for the current Australian national flag.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue today not because we believe that in any sustained sense we ought to be dragged off the main game, the main issue of today&mdash;which is unemployment and the damage that has been done to this nation and to the livelihood of nearly one million Australians by this Prime Minister&mdash;but because we feel it is essential that we focus today on the issue of the flag. This is particularly because it was this Prime Minister who, on a recent overseas trip, decided to do what he had not had the guts to do in Australia, which was to announce that he intended to change the flag. He did that on at least two occasions and perhaps three. There is a rumour to the effect that he actually mentioned it to the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Alatas. He certainly mentioned it during a lunch in Indonesia and he mentioned it to a small child in Papua New Guinea. This child had made the effort to make a copy of the Australian flag. The Prime Minister took it into his hands to tell that child and others that he would give them another flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is disgraceful and unforgivable behaviour by a man who has a total disregard for this country, its place in the world, its history, its heritage and its institutions. As we have said consistently over time, this man will say or do anything, distort anything, misrepresent anything and undermine any institution for short term political ends. Today, the focus of those activities is on the flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances I believe we need to ask two principal questions about the behaviour of our Prime Minister in relation to our flag. The first and most obvious question is: why is he pushing that issue at this time? There is no burning evidence anywhere that the Australian community is crying out for a change in the flag. Indeed, the most recent poll released today certainly confirms that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason why this Prime Minister is today trying to raise the issue of the flag and use it as a major political issue on a day-to-day basis is that he has lost the policy debate in this country. He was bowled over by the Fightback package, which demonstrated the need for a generational change of attitudes and values in this country, as well as policies. He has been unable to develop any effective response to that package. In fact, he brought down a small trimmed version of the package trying to make it look as though he could deliver some of the benefits of Fightback in his `One Nation, One Job' statement. How long did that last? It did not even last 24 hours before he knew he was in trouble. He knew that we were about to respond on that statement in the Parliament, so that afternoon he went out and belted our British heritage as a mechanism for diverting attention from the failure&mdash;his incapacity, if you like&mdash;to develop an effective response to Fightback. The attack on the flag is to be seen as nothing more than a deliberate distraction from the main game, trying to keep attention away from the fact that this man is the architect of the recession, that this man is the person who has inflicted more pain and hardship on average Australians than anybody else since the 1930s, and that this man has no policy solutions to those very difficult economic circumstances that confront this country today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So off he went in recent days. He had his Max Gillies script in one hand&mdash;he picked up Max Gillies' old speech and joke writer&mdash;and his twisted Jack Lang version of history in the other, and his basic personal deep contempt for Australian values and institutions. He armed himself with those three things before he went. He accuses the Opposition of looking to the past and living in the past. This man is a product of the Jack Lang of the 1930s. He knew nothing before be met Jack Lang&mdash;his formal education was particularly limited&mdash;and he learnt nothing after he left Jack Lang. We get Jack Lang every day in all forms. If honourable members want any evidence of that they should go back and look at some of the statements Lang made about grovelling to the British. We see the tugging of the forelock and the grovelling to the British&mdash;the same lines. This was pre the Max Gillies speech writer; he had Jack Lang. He learnt nothing before; he learnt nothing after. The man is in a total historical time warp when it comes to the nature of this country and the direction in which it should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look at the way the Prime Minister behaved overseas, at his misinterpretation, his misunderstanding of the significance of our history, average Australians are totally appalled, but they cannot help but wonder why this distraction. Average Australians get up every morning and they have a knot in their guts about whether they will keep their job, or, if they have lost their job, they have a knot in their guts about how they are going to get another one, how they will get trained, how their kids are going to get into universities or schools or TAFE colleges or whatever. They cannot understand why this guy just runs the distraction of the flag. All they hear, every time he opens his mouth, is about the flag and the monarchy, rather than what he is going to do to give them a job and their kids a future. That is the reason why this man has run the issue of the flag at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister sells himself around the world as an architect of change. He cannot grapple with the fact that only this side of the House stands for real change. All he stands as is a wrecker&mdash;in true Jack Lang style this man is a wrecker. He is prepared to tear down a fundamentally important institution and symbol like the Australian flag to satisfy his own short term political ends. Is that a sign of leadership? It is a sign of desperation. What we have is a desperate man, basically and personally insecure. He has shown that since he has been in the job. He does not know how to act; he does not know what to do next. He goes into Asia and convinces everybody of his insecurity and his personal weaknesses when it comes to dealing with the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I want to ask, having established why he is pushing that issue at this stage, is why he is wrong in attacking the flag at this particular time. There are a number of reasons why I believe he is wrong in the way he has done this and what he has done. Firstly, he did it overseas, as I mentioned before. In Australia he has been pressed on many occasions, particularly in television interviews, press conferences and on other occasions, to state his clear-cut position on the flag and whether he intended to change it, but he never said so. He waited till he was overseas. Somehow he thought it would impress the Indonesians when he admitted to them that he intended to change our flag. What a pile of nonsense. They would not be impressed. I did not see Suharto running around saying, `Mate, we are going to change our flags and carve our role in the world'. Could honourable members imagine Lee Kuan Yew coming out to Australia and sitting down and saying, `John, I have a real problem at home&mdash;that flag has just destroyed our chance of being an independent nation'. Of course the leaders of those countries would not do that. What on earth did the Prime Minister do it for? He made a mockery of himself, he made a mockery of the country and he demeaned our nation in the eyes of the Indonesians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesians do not think of us as a colony of the United Kingdom. For years they have known where we have been and where we have been coming from. They have a particular relationship with us because we stood up for their independence back in the late 1940s. They know where we are and where we are coming from. But they cannot understand why the Prime Minister cannot understand why Australia has fallen off the pace and why the nations of Asia look down on us. The reason is that our relative economic performance has collapsed. They cannot understand why, with all our national wealth and resources, we have fallen so far off the pace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Prime Minister was questioned about this in the Parliament, he knew that he had made a mistake in his answer. So he came back to it in a later answer. He quoted the text of his speech about Kokoda and he attacked us for suggesting that he had given that connotation. But he took only the first part of the speech. If we go to the middle of the speech, we read lines such as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australians who served here in Papua New Guinea fought and died, not in the defence of the old world, but the new world. Their world.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why it might be said that, for Australians, the battles in Papua New Guinea were the most important ever fought.</PARA>
<PARA>What is more important about giving one's life and fighting a battle on the Kokoda Trail? They were all important. They all believed in this nation. They all fought for its future. To hear the Prime Minister make that sort of argument in this House today is the most demeaning thing that I have seen in a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, he showed an appalling ignorance&mdash;another reason why he is wrong&mdash;of the history of our flag. He was asked a question about whether, having kissed the ground at the Kokoda Trail, he was prepared to kiss the flag under which they fought and under which they were buried. He said that they did not&mdash;and he sat down as if that had absolved him. That cannot absolve him from that blatant inconsistency, and his answer was wrong. Alf Garland, who is the head of the RSL, is in the gallery today. He is prepared to be quoted as saying that in World War they fought under the Blue Ensign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My point is very simple: the Prime Minister has deliberately and knowingly distorted both the history of the flag and our military history to his own particular political end. He is trying to build a case for something that he raised under the pressure of the debate in this country when he had no clear idea of where he was going. He had no specific plans as to what to do. In fact, the only hint of any plan that we have heard of in recent days is whether he has asked his mate John Singleton to see whether he could come up with a design for the flag. The Prime Minister might deny that in the course of this debate, but he had no clear cut idea of what he was doing. He still cannot answer specific questions as to how he will determine whether or not the flag ought to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to a third and an important reason why the Prime Minister is wrong in what he is doing. He is illegitimate as a Prime Minister in the sense that he is unelected as a Prime Minister. Yet he feels that he can come into this job and dispense with national symbols as important as our flag, again for his own particular short term political ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the Prime Minister: if he is going to put this as a policy, if he is going to advocate changing the flag, give the people of Australia the chance to change him, at the same time as they get a chance to express their view on the flag. Quite frankly, unless he is prepared to go to a vote of all of the people of Australia, he is obviously manipulating this issue for short term political gain. I want to see him test that at the next election by having a full-scale vote of the people of Australia so that they will have a chance to express their view not only about our flag but also about whether they want to change the Prime Minister as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make very briefly, as I am running out of time, is that this Prime Minister obviously does not understand the nature of our flag and the elements of our history and our institutions that are encapsulated in that flag. If we look at our flag, we see that it stands for our institutions and our values, it stands for our history, it stands for our language, it stands for our Federation and it stands for our independence under the Southern Cross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It picks up the Cross of St Andrew, the Scottish background; it picks up the Cross of St George, the English background; and it picks up the saltire of St Patrick, the Irish background. In attacking this flag, the Prime Minister disowns all that heritage; he disowns the institutions that are encapsulated in it; and he disowns the Federation that is depicted on it by the Federation star and the independence that is conveyed by the Southern Cross. He does not understand the significance of the flag, yet he is prepared to manipulate it for a short term political end.

The Leader of the Opposition says it is a distortion, a misrepresentation. One question he asked was this: why is the Prime Minister pushing this issue at this time? The answer is this: to make our way in the world, and particularly this part of the world, we have to be entirely certain of who we are, what we are, and what we wish to do. </PARA>

The fact of the matter is that it is entirely healthy to debate whether the Australian flag ambiguously or unambiguously represents an image of Australia. I have given my view. My view is that it does, and it is something that the Government will think about. While many of our institutions, our traditions and even our attitudes are British, we are not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the course of his remarks the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is entirely a healthy thing to debate the national flag.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is so, why has he gagged the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) today? He is not game enough to face a fair dinkum debate; he is not game enough to allow his colleagues to vote on this matter, because he knows the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) and maybe one or two other honourable members would cross the floor. We already know from the first division that occurred today that the Government's majority is now down to fewer than four. It is very much a wafer thin majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister had the hide to inject the name of one Black Jack McEwen into this debate. This gives me the opportunity to correctly lay before the House some history about the absolute commitment of the coalition to Asia, to developing the right way forward for this country more than four decades ago. Guess what happened! In 1940 Black Jack McEwen was Minister for External Affairs. At that time he became the first Minister in the history of Australia to approve the appointment of ambassadors outside the British Commonwealth. In other words, he took the development and evolution of Australia's independence forward in a very practical way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in 1957, as the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has reminded me, there was the development of the Australia-Japan trade treaty, which was ahead of its time. It was led by Black Jack McEwen as the then Minister for Trade. It had the full support of the coalition government and was opposed by the Labor Party, which at that time did not want to have a bar of it. So let us have a lot less nonsense from this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might have forgotten that it was this Prime Minister who, on 26 February, brought down a statement entitled One Nation, yet ever since he has done nothing but divide the nation on issue after issue. At every opportunity, if it is not the national flag, it is the constitution and the constitutional monarchy that he raises in an atrocious way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets even worse; he gets let off for some of these things. But honourable members will recall that in January the Prime Minister, against all odds and without any justification whatsoever, decided to inject a very divisive connotation of Asian immigration into the national debate by making some very deliberate remarks at that time. He should hang his head in shame. He has no right to reflect on the coalition, which has led Australia down the path of broadening its diplomatic relations beyond the Commonwealth and of opening up its trading relations with Asia. The Labor Party is a Johnny-come-lately in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How shamefaced the Prime Minister should have been when getting off the plane in Djakarta, that being his first ever working visit as a frontbencher to Indonesia in the nine years that Labor has been in government! Contrast that with the Leader of the Opposition, who time after time, both in private life and as Leader of the Opposition, has gone to Asia, particularly north-east Asia, on working visits. He knows Asia far better than the Prime Minister will ever understand or know Asia. Contrast that with a number of my colleagues on the front bench, notably the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who of course is often referred to as being almost resident in Asia.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> The Prime Minister has been to Europe, he has been to the United States, he has made a couple of visits to Japan and one visit to China for a World Bank conference. He overflew every ASEAN country year after year, and he made 14 trips to Europe. Yet he has the hide to claim that he has a knowledge of Asia, that he has a commitment to Asia over and above that of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I try to go to Asia every January&mdash;because of sun cancer I do not like lying on beaches&mdash;on a working visit. I have been to 18 countries in Asia since 1985. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) might laugh at that, but it is part of my commitment as a member of this Parliament to better understand the real links between Australia and Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing that Asians will not tolerate, the one thing that they will see through time and time again, is people coming to their region and visiting their countries in a way which is less than fair dinkum, in a way which is borne out by the fact that for years those people have had an opportunity to visit Asia and have not done so. The Asians will smell it, they will expose it and they will treat with contempt those who fly in and fly out hoping that somehow that will give them the commitment, the understanding and the obligation to Asia. Of course, Australia must proceed down that path. I warn the Prime Minister that he has got it wrong, and he is very wrong in opposing the coalition's commitment to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us get back to some of the history associated with our great national flag. Again the Prime Minister was wrong on that. It was flying in 1901. Then came World War I. By regulation, the Royal Navy adopted the Blue Ensign Australian national flag and it sailed forward into World War I. Indeed it has been carried on many occasions since. I read this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All fought under flags in which the Union Jack was incorporated. The Australian flag flew proudly over HMAS Sydney as she defeated the German ship Emden in the First World War. The first Allied flag raised in Singapore&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And note the pride in this. There have had members in this Parliament such as Senator Sir John Carrick and the former Labor Minister, Tom Uren, who were prisoners of war in Changi and on the Burma death railway. They have recounted to us the horrors that they faced. But there were a group of Australians in Singapore who risked their lives to make an Australian flag in secret. If they had been found with that Australian flag screwed up in bamboo under their bunks or whatever in Changi, it would have meant instant death. But they had sufficient commitment to the Australian flag in World War II, in the closing months of that war, to complete the construction of an Australian national flag with raw materials. So the Australian flag flew at the Japanese surrender in 1945, and it was that Australian flag made in secret in the Changi prisoner of war camp. That is the sort of commitment we want from this Prime Minister, not the notion that he can come in as an appointed, unelected Prime Minister, rip the flag off the official prime ministerial car and then proceed to dump on the Australian flag whilst he is on foreign soil and everywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time to get back to tintacks in this debate. I want to make the point that the definition of `sovereignty' and the independence of Australia are relevant. At the base of the Prime Minister's attitude and campaign is a fundamental flaw, namely, that Australia is somehow not independent and not a sovereign nation whilst we are under this current and wonderful national flag. Wrong! He should accept the definition of `sovereignty' from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encyclopaedia of Public International Law,</EMPHASIS> which is relevant to this debate and is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sovereignty in the sense of contemporary public international law denotes the basic international legal status of a State that is not subject, within its territorial jurisdiction, to the governmental, executive or judicial jurisdiction of a foreign State or to foreign law other than public international law.</PARA>
<PARA>In case the Minister is unaware, this country is a sovereign country and has been for many years. This country is an independent nation and has been recognised as such for many years. This country has operated under this wonderful national symbol&mdash;our current national flag&mdash;and in no way does that national flag traduce that sovereignty or that independence. Shame on the Prime Minister and shame on the Government for suggesting otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Prime Minister has failed in his first obligation of office. We are in an horrific recession. Four community soup kitchens are operating in Albury-Wodonga 60 years after the Great Depression. We have more than one million people unemployed right around Australia in every one of the 148 electorates in this country. There are almost record levels of unemployment in some and more than record levels of unemployment in others. That, more than ever, would surely bring forth from a Prime Minister a desire to provide some empathy, cohesion and leadership in order to avoid unnecessary division as we, as a nation, need to work through this horrific great recession of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have instead? We have one of the most divisive persons ever to occupy the office of Prime Minister. This person has gone out of his way to add to the anger and angst which so many Australians feel in this great recession. For that, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister stands condemned by the House. At the same time, it gives me the opportunity to declare again on behalf of the Liberal and National parties that there is nothing wrong with the current national flag. It should never be changed other than by a vote of the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give these fellows a history lesson. This matter of public importance trails a coat of hypocrisy and ignorance. The very first point made by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who has just sat down&mdash;and it was his point of pride&mdash;was that the Royal Australian Navy picked up its own flag in 1911. I have bad news for him. For a variety of other purposes, I happen to have the memorandum of the Chief of the Naval Staff to the Commonwealth Government dated 8 December 1965 which asks for an Australian Navy flag. He actually gives reasons for doing that and he points to some of the history. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formation of the RAN was discussed at various imperial conferences between 1909 and 1911 and the Ensign to be worn by Australian and other dominion ships was raised at this time. Australian and Canadian representatives and Federal Ministers made several attempts to obtain agreement to the wearing of the White Ensign defaced in the fly by the Commonwealth emblem or to the wearing of the Australian flag. The Admiralty adhered to its view that the undefaced White Ensign should be worn with a dominion flag as a Jack.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on. He has done a bit of a study of the naval establishments <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>in 1965. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have accordingly sought the views of a large number of senior officers at both Navy Office and in ships and establishments. The survey shows&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a small majority favours a change now to an Australian White Ensign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a large majority is in favour of the Navy making a change itself rather than permitting external pressure to force a change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a majority believe that a change would be welcomed by most of the RAN.</PARA>
<PARA>This was in 1965; in fact in 1967 the government of the day did it. The Opposition's position on this issue, as on so many others, is conceived in total ignorance. One of the reasons why the Government did it was that there had been some rumblings amongst members of the British Government at the time that Royal Australian Navy ships serving off Vietnam would be mistaken, by virtue of that flag, for Royal Navy ships. It was not in the interests of the British Government to find itself in any way, shape or form connected with the policies being pursued by the Liberal Government of Australia in Vietnam. I do not blame it one bit for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was a struggle to get that identity for Australian ships and it was not obtained until 1967. So this nonsense that the honourable member went on with that we had a flag for our Navy in 1911 is just that&mdash;nonsense. It is nonsense because the British Admiralty said, `You are a dominion ship and you will wear a White Ensign'. So we did until it ceased to be the convenience of the British Admiralty or anyone else as far as that situation was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point concerns the flags with which we went to war; in fact, we went to war with three. At various stages both in the First and Second World Wars, our troops fought under the Union Jack, the Red Ensign and the Blue Ensign. There was no clear-cut position as to what would be the Australian flag under which we fought. Indeed, the only time a clear-cut position was established in that regard was in 1953. So if we are going to have a debate about this flag, let us have a discussion of it on a factual basis as to how it has been transformed through time. There has not been a consistent policy about the Australian flag since Federation: about the form of its basic structure, the form of the various ensigns attached to it, or about the etiquette that applies as to when it ought to be flown. There has never been a single position on any of those things since 1901. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there has been a steady progression through that period toward bringing the flag closer and closer to an individual Australian national identity which had been cut off from its roots in the past. The Royal Australian Navy had to conduct an argument with the Royal Navy in 1901&mdash;which it lost&mdash;on the grounds that the Royal Navy establishment at that time did not believe there was a separate dominion navy. That was all there was to it&mdash;even though we had passed legislation in our chamber to establish a separate Royal Australian Navy. Finally, when we moved on it there was some dissent in Britain as to whether we ought to carry it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, if there is going to be any change to the flag it cannot be done on the basis of a simple fiat. There has to be some form of consensus obtained for it. We have at least this: there is a steady growth of desire on the part of the Australian people to express themselves and their individuality with their own national symbols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to Federation with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> as our national anthem. It remained our national anthem until this Government came to office; although in 1977, as was said during Question Time, it was decided that there should be some transformation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advance Australia Fair </EMPHASIS>to a higher status as a national song. Again, none of these things are immutable. We fought in World War II with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> as our national anthem. It has not been considered as absolutely critical that because we fought World War II with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">God Save the Queen</EMPHASIS> as our national anthem that is what ought to obtain from this time on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if there is going to be any change to the national flag&mdash;as in many ways there were changes as far as those other things were concerned&mdash;we will have to go through a process of building consensus within the Australian community for such a change. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has never resiled from that. I have said that this matter of public importance was conceived in hypocrisy&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now turn to the point about hypocrisy in respect of the presentation of this matter of public importance. The Prime Minister was quite right to regard this as a suitable diversion by the Opposition from a discussion of internal matters concerning sugar or a discussion of internal matters on the position of the New South Wales Opposition. We now have the hypocrisy of a complaint that an Australian domestic issue was discussed overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has retreated from that. Honourable members will recollect that a couple of days ago the Opposition was saying that the Prime Minister first raised the matter when he happened to be overseas in Indonesia. It has at least had the vague honesty to try to obfuscate and walk away from that because, firstly, it understands that he did in fact raise this matter before he went to Indonesia. Secondly, it was raised in the context of an answer to a question as to his particular views in that regard. In regard to expressing views overseas, the answer to one particular question can be contrasted with the endless speechifying by the Leader of the Opposition when he is overseas: bagging this country, bagging the work habits of this country and bagging the attitudes of this country to overseas audiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cant and hypocrisy which have accompanied the Opposition's position on this are matched only by the Opposition's appalling ignorance of the history of the way in which the Australian flag and its associated ensigns have been developed, as I have had occasion to point out by directing Opposition members' attention to a useful piece of history in the Chief of Naval Staff's memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That hypocrisy extends further, to the criticism of the Prime Minister's position on Asia. Every editorial in this country which has considered the worth of the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia, and every reasonable journalist who has written articles in assessing the value of it, has pointed to its success and to the fact that it has established the framework for a better relationship with Australia's most important neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former Defence Minister, I personally was grateful that the Prime Minister pointed out one of the strategic salient facts of our region which our country needs to consider continually&mdash;that is, if the new order government had not been what emerged from that imbroglio in Asia in the mid-1960s, we would not be talking about 2 to 3 per cent of GDP being spent on defence in this country; we would be talking about 5 to 10 per cent of GDP being spent on defence in this country. That was a very important salient fact. We do not have acknowledgment of that from the Opposition, as we do not have a defence policy from the Opposition&mdash;although we were promised one 18 months ago, after the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this is a motion conceived in hypocrisy. It has trailed a coat of ignorance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the second reading of the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill, which was introduced into the Parliament recently by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). The purpose of the Bill is said to be to give effect to the 1990 amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Australia would then be able to ratify the amendments to the protocol. The legislation will also strengthen the existing provisions of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 so that the manufacture and import of substances that destroy the protective shield of ozone in the stratosphere can be phased out in accordance with Australia's national strategy for ozone protection, a strategy which is three years ahead of the protocol in its current form. The only other part of the second reading speech to which I wish to refer is this statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians will be aware that we rely on a small layer of ozone in the stratosphere to filter out harmful ultraviolet radiation. Excessive ultraviolet radiation has the potential to cause major health problems to humans and animals and severely damage crops and natural ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition supports this Bill. We have consistently advocated an accelerated commitment to the phasing out of these substances. The policy which was adopted by the Opposition early in 1990 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to CFCs, we commend the positive steps taken by industry to move to eliminate the use of CFCs in Australia and we will act to ensure their complete elimination (excluding medical and pharmacological uses) by a target date of 1995. The export of CFCs and halons will be banned. We will work for further revisions of the provisions of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention on the protection of the earth's ozone layer to facilitate international co-operation in these endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA>I place some emphasis on that, because I think there is a lack of public understanding of the extent to which on major environmental issues there is bipartisan support for the action which has to be taken by government. In this case we adopted a target which was some five years in advance of the international protocol. So it is not surprising that now that the Government is legislating to bring the Australian legislative framework into line with the accelerating international framework&mdash;in other words, to bring the target back to 1997&mdash;it has our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the legislation to protect the ozone layer was originally introduced into this Parliament, our then environment spokesman, Senator Puplick, moved an amendment which, as I recall, was adopted by the Government. Without setting a specific target, it urged the Government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to use the best endeavours to encourage Australian industry to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)replace ozone depleting substances; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)achieve a faster and greater reduction in the levels of production and use of ozone depleting substances than are provided for in the Convention and the Protocol&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>with qualifications in these terms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the extent that such replacements and achievements are reasonably possible within the limits imposed by the availability of suitable alternate substances, and appropriate technology and devices.</PARA>
<PARA>That qualification is necessary because there are technical difficulties&mdash;I will refer to them later&mdash;which we must deal with in a practical and timely way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also reference to pharmacological uses. That highlights the uncertainty of science, in a sense, because the widespread use of these CFCs occurred because they seemed to have such benign properties. An important ongoing use of these substances at the moment is in the puffer sprays which asthmatics blow into their lungs. They are suitable for that purpose because they do not harm human beings. They are inert gases. That is why, for example, halons have been used in fire extinguishers. For many decades we have used these substances believing they were benign. Only recently we have found that they appear to have quite a dramatic impact on the ozone layer, which in turn has a very significant role in filtering ultraviolet radiation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the livability of the globe and on the capacity of the globe to continue to reproduce the life that we rely upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An excess of ultraviolet radiation can have an inhibiting effect on both sea life and on the development of plant life. Therefore, we are looking at changes which are potentially of enormous significance to human life on the planet. Because this is not a divisive issue, and because it is an issue on which the politicians of Australia in 1992 are scarcely if ever credited with doing anything worth while, it is worth stopping to note that over a period of years the political parties in this country have been prepared to acknowledge the significant dangers which exist in this area and to take legislative action to reduce those dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pausing to contemplate another great positive which is that in this field we have seen unexceptionable cooperation between government and industry, between government and industry and consumers and between governments around the world. Attention tends to be focused in the news and in political and public debate on areas of policy failure. But in this case virtually all of the players have moved to accept that there is a significant problem which needs remedial action, and each has chosen to play its part in a most constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, for example, that action by consumers in this country has been in advance of the legislative requirements. To some extent there was not a consumer led recovery, which we often hear about in economic debate, but a consumer led movement away from products using CFCs, to the point where it became commercially necessary for manufacturers to respond. They did this by having emblazoned on their products that they were non-CFC users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look ahead to the next 50 years&mdash;a period in which the population of the globe will double and in which of necessity we are going to have to carry out our activities in a more clever fashion using fewer resources more effectively and more efficiently&mdash;we can look at this area as one from which we can take some satisfaction and indeed get some hope. We have seen an acknowledgment of the problem; we have seen action on the problem from all of those levels; and, where that action has appeared to be inadequate, we have seen a preparedness to accelerate the actions which are being taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ozone Diplomacy </EMPHASIS>by Richard Benedick sums up the problems which I as a would-be policy maker find, and which I am sure are problems which afflict the Minister and anyone else in this field, in terms of making decisions about what action is appropriate, often in circumstances of some scientific uncertainty. I will quote a few paragraphs from this publication:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiators of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol faced issues similar to those raised by potential climate change.

Technological solutions were either nonexistent or were considered unacceptable by most major participating governments.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later Mr Benedick writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policymakers face a dilemma in attempting to deal with these new environmental challenges. Premature actions or regulations based on imprecise and possibly incorrect theories and data can incur costs that later turn out to be unnecessary. But postponing a decision also might not be cost free. Waiting for more complete evidence can run the risk of acting too late to prevent major and possibly irreversible damage. In this eventuality, the future economic and social costs could be much higher, perhaps even catastrophic.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same publication he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the efforts to protect the ozone layer clearly demonstrates the crucial role played by industry in developing and implementing international environmental policy. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A little later he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noteworthy that on the three occasions since 1985, pragmatically oriented American industry forces intervened in favor of the international regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to put those quotes on the record because, in the immediate context, the Government, and indeed the Opposition, face what is, with respect to the greenhouse impact and the question of climate change and what action should currently be taken by government, by industry and by individuals, an area of very great scientific uncertainty. This separate issue of dealing with the ozone layer is demonstrative of the way that all sections&mdash;government, industry, individuals and the international community&mdash;have to try to come to grips with quite difficult scientific uncertainty and to set courses which in the long term will be in the personal, business, national and international interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point worth noting in this debate, on a Bill which has the broad approval of the Parliament and therefore does not need to be debated in a contentious way, is that the ozone issue gives us an example of an area where international action is clearly required. I want to dwell on that for a moment because in my own State of Western Australia, and I do not think this is peculiar to that State, one increasingly comes across a quite hysterical response to any prospect of international involvement on environmental or indeed other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This response is often sparked by bodies such as the League of Rights whose propaganda tends to be more effective in times of great economic hardship. There are so many people in rural Australia in particular, and indeed throughout the country, who are suffering very deeply at the moment, who cannot understand why our country is in such difficulties, who are desperate to find answers which will make sense to them and who are therefore very open to arguments about everything being caused by international conspiracies by little groups of people, whether Jewish bankers, masons or Catholics&mdash;you name it. It is pretty hard to escape being involved in one of the groups that might be subjected to these conspiracy theories. It is my unhappy experience that when one expresses some scepticism about these theories one is immediately seen to be part of the plot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International action on the environment does tend to invite that sort of response from some people, who I think play upon the fears of those who are under great hardship and who have difficulty in understanding present circumstances in Australia, in a way which is very unfortunate and does nothing to add to our capacity as a community to deal with real problems. When one looks at the problem of the ozone layer it becomes readily apparent that international action is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, whilst a highly sophisticated economy and a very wealthy country in an international sense, is a country which, on a per capita basis, with its widespread use of refrigeration, air-conditioning and manufacturing processes which use CFCs, is a large user of these chemicals. It is therefore utterly appropriate that Australia as a country should take action. But we represent, of course, only a tiny fraction of the world use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look ahead optimistically to a period of increased living standards in large population countries such as India and Japan, it is not hard to see that it is likely that the technologies which use CFCs are going to be much more widely used. Refrigeration is not something which Australians can regard as only their right; air-conditioning is not something which they can regard as only their right, any more than it could be only the right of the United States or the rich countries of Europe. So we face a situation where, if we are to solve the immediate difficulties of removing these harmful substances from massive use in the developed world, we have to face up to the reality that we have to try to ensure that large population and relatively poor countries develop in a way that will avoid their repeating the mistakes that we have made and avoid their simply moving into the old technology and using these substances in a way which negates the value of our stepping back from their use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the most conspiracy-minded person can see that we need to work in concert with North America, Europe and all the countries in the world to tackle this problem. This is not a matter for political division within this country, except in what I would call the lunatic fringes. Labor, Liberal and National are all united in accepting that there is a need for some form of common international action. As I say, the beauty of this area is that the individuals in Australia have led the way with their behaviour. The Government, at a national and international level, is simply following their good example. This is a classic area where unilateral action is relatively pointless and we need action on all fronts. It demonstrates that international action is not some illegitimate thing which is aimed at undermining our rights and freedoms in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important point. It may be irrelevant to many of those in this chamber, but I see enough of this sort of campaigning in my home State of Western Australia to think it is a matter of policy concern. I remind the House that quite recently we in this chamber were looking at amendments to the wildlife protection legislation where we also dealt with agreements relating to the protection of the habitats of migratory birds. There again is a clear area where, unless there is international action, we will not do the task which we would want for Australia, any more than the task which could be done for the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have one concern about this Bill. I have not spent much time explaining what it does, but essentially it accelerates the phase-out. It also gives the Government a great deal of flexibility in terms of future changes. I suppose if I were in a more rambunctious and critical mood I might be chiding the Government for the fact that it is nearly two years since the changes were made to the protocol and it has taken a bit of time for the amendment to get into this House&mdash;certainly something in excess of a year&mdash;and the Government is desperately anxious for the amendment to be put through before the next round of international negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has our support in achieving that objective. But in all of the consultation in relation to this Bill&mdash;I acknowledge the excellent advice which we have been given by the Department and, I believe, the Minister on this Bill&mdash;a query has been raised with respect to clause 44 of the Bill. There is some concern that what is provided for in clause 44 ought perhaps be changed. I raise that matter because I would like some assurance from the Minister when she responds on the second reading, if she graces us with that response, or if her junior Minister does so&mdash;I am sorry, I am not sure who is dealing with the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) is to stand in on the matter. I would seek some assurance from her. Class 44 gives the Government discretion with respect to establishing products which are scheduled substances. I simply want to have the assurance of the Minister that action taken under clause 44 is subject to parliamentary disallowance. It is my understanding that that is so, but I would like it to be clarified by the Minister so that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> can be used if necessary at some later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We considered whether or not we should move an amendment to require further legislative action, but in light of our general policy seeking a reasonable approach in this matter, where we ask the Government to work with industry to accelerate these things as far as possible, it seemed to us that, provided parliamentary control was retained through the disallowance mechanism, we should not be seeking any amendment to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other concerns of an economic nature have been raised with respect to the Bill. I simply draw that matter to the Government's attention, although I know that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories is certainly aware of it because she has made some critical comments about the estimates which were produced by the Australian Supermarket Institute as to the cost and logistic problems involved in the phase-out. Honourable members would understand that the supermarket industry is a major user of refrigerants and it faces a Bill which it has assessed as running into some billions of dollars. That assessment is certainly much higher than any other assessment which has been drawn to my attention. I know the Institute is not seeking to have the Bill opposed; it is simply concerned about that aspect of it. I say to the Government that there is a strong responsibility on the Government to work very closely with industry to make sure that what has been required is practical and that the materials are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the speeding up of the world's phase-out, it is likely that the substitute chemicals will be in high demand. Active government monitoring will be necessary to make sure that what is required by industry is available and, if it is found that the Parliament has imposed any impractical requirements on industry, to look at what action can and should be taken by government in that regard. I simply say to the Government that I think there is a very strong ongoing monitoring role. It may well be that the Government also has an expediting role in terms of making sure that the challenge to meet our accelerated targets can be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that some sections of industry are very enthusiastic about meeting this challenge. Du Pont, for example, has called on industry and government leaders to accelerate the shift from CFC dependency. I have known people to be quite cynical about this and to say that, as a marketer of substitutes, Du Pont perhaps speaks from its pocket as well as from its ideals, but I think that is probably a rather churlish approach to adopt. In noting the enthusiasm of some sectors of industry for an accelerated response, including that great world chemical company, Du Pont, I simply draw attention to the responsibility that lies upon companies like that and on the Government to make sure that the other industries which are involved are given practical and economically reasonable ways of meeting those targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I want to deal with is a point of complaint. There is little argument that the environment has been something of a political football in this country. It has been a source of some complaint from me that much of it has been played for the likely preference response as for the substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback package announced by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) last year on behalf of the Opposition, in what I have described as the more difficult area of climate control and of looking at the question of greenhouse gas emissions, we made the simple point that there is a responsibility on government not merely to lecture other people on what to do; there is a responsibility on government as a major player in the Australian economy to lead by example. We state as an objective in the Fightback program: tackle the greenhouse issue on the basis not of do as I say but do as I do. Before the last election the Opposition, in the millennium milestone speech put forward by the then Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, in conjunction with the then environment spokesman, Senator Chris Puplick, made clear commitments for the Government's own response to the greenhouse phase-out. We think that is a matter which ought to be taken up by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from anything else, I think it would be enormously educational for the Commonwealth bureaucracy to adopt a hands-on role with respect to Commonwealth Government activities. During the past year in this chamber we have seen a refusal on the part of the Government to accept the responsibility of meeting State pollution requirements. I remind the House that the Minister has said that this Government wishes to have the strictest pollution standards in the world, yet this Government refuses to change the laws so that the Government itself will meet the pollution requirements which are imposed upon private citizens and private business. In this field of the phasing out of CFCs, there is a pretty clear picture, namely, that the Government itself, as a major user of CFCs, does not have an orderly or, in any sense, a complete program for meeting the challenge which it is so vigorously, and in my view properly, thrusting upon industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the information that we have been able to obtain from the briefings which have been made possible through the Minister's office, it appears that some effective action has been taken with respect to halons. But it appears also that there is no concerted planning within the Commonwealth itself. I repeat that the Commonwealth is a major operator within the Australian economy; it is a major user of air-conditioned premises, for example; it is a major influence in many areas of industry. Its corporations are major operators in the economy. Yet it does not seem to be meeting the standards which are being put upon private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances I think there is a real need for the Government to adopt a similar approach&mdash;that which is advocated in Fightback&mdash;namely, an approach which is based on leading by example. I say that because I think it is important to demonstrate bona fides and to demonstrate that the targets can be achieved by the actions of government. But I think it is also very important from the point of view of that army of public servants who are concerned with the administration of these laws and the proposing of new laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot criticism around Australia about the remoteness of Canberra. As someone who has worked closely with the Commonwealth bureaucracy as a Minister over a period of some years, I formed an enormous affection and respect for the bureaucracy and its capacity to respond to political leadership and meet the demands of the Government of the day. In my maiden speech nearly 20 years ago, I expressed a view about the remoteness of this capital from the reality of Australian life. Coming to the Senate as a Western Australian, as I did then, I based those comments on my experience in Western Australia, the contact that I had with Commonwealth public servants and the statements made to me by Commonwealth public servants about the difference that they felt when they worked in a State capital or a place such as Norfolk Island and faced the people who are affected by the decisions as against working through Canberra. I think there is too much of a contempt in this town for actually doing the job as against working out the policy. I think it would be extraordinarily useful for the bureaucracy as a whole if, when it set about laying down what should be done by people in the rest of Australia, it made sure that it was a priority part of the program that those standards were met by the bureaucracy's own operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are all entitled to have a sense of great satisfaction about the bipartisan good sense which has been shown over a period of years with respect to this issue. I wish that there were a broader understanding in the Australian community that, on so many issues which are important to Australia, there is this sort of commonsense and often commonly supported action by the Parliament. I think we would all&mdash;public servants, government members and opposition members alike&mdash;enjoy slightly better reputations in the community if that were more broadly understood. My fundamental complaint about this legislation is that, in laying down even stricter requirements on Australian industry, we run the risk that those who make the rules are the last to play by them. I hope that at some future time the Minister will be able to give me an assurance that that is not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We might debate the actual manufacture of some of these things. Of course we are users of cars and refrigerants. Anyway, that would be a very useful part of the debate. Where there might be some debate and scepticism about the timing and impact of greenhouse gases on the world climate, there really is no scepticism or disbelief about the impact of substances that deplete the ozone layer. That is why the international community and, indeed, this Government have moved swiftly to see whether we can ensure that ozone depleting substances are withdrawn from use as quickly as feasible. I think we have been good at setting a decent pace in making sure that ozone harmful substances are reduced in this country as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill, of course, is to give effect to the 1990 amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. Australia will then be able to ratify the amendments to the protocol. This legislation will also strengthen the existing provisions of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 so that the manufacture and import of substances that destroy the protective shield of ozone in the stratosphere can be phased down in accordance with Australia's national strategy for ozone protection, a strategy which is some three years ahead of the protocol in its current form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global framework for the debate about reduction in these damaging substances is set by the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. It sets out international actions to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, by controlling the production and trade in CFCs. These actions will be reviewed periodically. They are to be reviewed in November this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 protocol set the following targets: based on 1986 levels of usage, CFCs will be phased out to 50 per cent levels by 1995; 85 per cent by 1997; and completely, that is 100 per cent, by the year 2000. There should be a 50 per cent phase-out of halons based on 1986 levels by 1995, and a total phase-out by the year 2000. There will be a 30 per cent phase-out of methyl chloroform by 1995 based on 1989 levels, a 70 per cent phase-out by the year 2000, and a total phase-out by the year 2005. There will be an 85 per cent phase-out for carbon tetrachloride by 1995 based on 1989 levels, and a 100 per cent phase out by the year 2000. Of course, we are expecting later this year in the 1992 protocol to bring forward the phase-out target dates from 2000 to perhaps 1997 or 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian equivalent, or our framework for ozone protection, is the Commonwealth's Ozone Protection Act 1989 and our strategy for ozone protection. Initially, the Commonwealth's focus in Australia was on aerosols; dry-cleaning; fire protection, that is, halons; solvents; and plastic foams. But there is now a greater focus on air-conditioning and refrigeration, especially industrial and commercial. Our strategy for ozone protection provides a basis for phasing out production and import of CFCs by the end of 1997. By 1991 Australia had already reduced CFC consumption to less than 50 per cent of 1986 levels, which of course is four years ahead of the 1990 protocol target. We are now well placed to reduce CFC consumption to about 10 per cent of 1986 levels by 1995&mdash;that is a 90 per cent phase-out&mdash;reserving consumption for essential uses and servicing of existing equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Pearce mentioned that there was some resistance or nervousness about the phase-out levels from Australian Supermarket Institute Ltd, which indicated that it felt the Government's levels of phase-out were somewhat unrealistic, and it detailed what it called a realistic approach to the problems. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is only one solution&mdash;governments, both national and state, must ensure that perfectly sound refrigeration equipment that cannot be converted in the unrealistic time frame being set by other nations is allowed to be maintained in good order and is supplied with the necessary gases (albeit CFC and HCFC) until alternate gases and equipment are available at a realistic cost with adequate technical support.</PARA>
<PARA>The ASI is wrong to suggest that we are forcing it to change its equipment. In fact, what the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has said is that CFC equipment will be able to continue in operation for as long as recycled product can be obtained to operate it, or with the use of drop-in replacements. That is most important. We certainly want to push the users of these elements as hard as we can. The point is to ensure that these damaging chemicals do not reach the ozone layer and continue to eat away at it. But we are not suggesting wholesale replacement of equipment. We are suggesting that it is possible to use replacements fed into the machinery to allow refrigeration and so on to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was reading an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today by Julian Cribb, who wrote about experiments undertaken by the International Rice Research Institute. It was experimenting with the impact of ultraviolet B radiation on the production of rice. We know that there will be a great deal more ultraviolet B radiation hitting the earth's surface as a result of the impact of CFCs and other harmful substances on the ozone layer. An experiment is being undertaken in the Philippines with a battery of ultraviolet lamps, which is duplicating the radiation levels that it is  believed will bombard the earth in less than 20 years. This experiment is destroying rice crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fairly chilling message about the impact that the depletion of the ozone layer will have on perhaps the major food source and the major grain crop grown in the world. As ever, science is coming up with some responses to this future environmental problem of further degradation of the ability to grow these crops. The research undertaken by the International Rice Research Institute shows that of the 120 kinds of rice tested under high ultraviolet B, only a handful have been found to be tolerant of high UVB. In that handful lies the possibility of breeding strains that may be naturally resistant to higher levels of UVB. So although science has helped to destroy, at least as an interim measure it might help to hold the line in the production of rice crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say `interim measure' because, although this Government has done good work in ensuring a fairly swift phase-out of these damaging substances, in the interim period of 30, 40 or 50 years we cannot do much to undo the destruction done to the ozone layer. What we can do is ensure that there is no further destruction of that layer. It is a layer that is replaced slowly by natural processes, but there will be an interim period in which there will be significant and higher levels of ultraviolet radiation. Until such time as all, or almost all, of these substances are no longer used, there will be a period of literally a window onto the earth's surface when we will have to suffer the damaging consequences of these rays. </PARA>

I am disappointed to see that only a relatively few members of the House have taken the opportunity to have a look at the subject. As someone who comes from the land, I believe that the depletion of the ozone layer is an indication of a great gap in our knowledge. We know something is going on up there, and we are not quite sure what it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is sufficient evidence around the countryside now to suggest that this may be the holocaust, or potentially the holocaust, that the world will have to come to grips with. If we keep on depleting the ozone layer, the effect on crops, cattle production and the world's food bowls could be absolutely dramatic and devastating. Those poor nations in the Third World who are struggling to feed themselves might find that they are in a much worse situation five or 10 years down the track. Whilst saying that that is the potential, I go on to look at some of the reports. I am disturbed by the gap in our knowledge about the ozone layer and the way we are going about the scientific research into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all I go back to the USCPA report of 1986 which was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The effects of the change of stratosphere ozone in global climate</EMPHASIS>. In that report it gives some idea of how fragile the ozone layer is. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the ozone in the earth's atmosphere resides in a region of the atmosphere known as the stratosphere. The stratosphere extends from about eight kilometres at the poles and 17 kilometres at the equator, to about 50 kilometres above the earth's surface. Ozone is the only gas in the atmosphere that prevents harmful solar ultraviolet radiation from reaching the surface of the earth. The total amount of ozone in the atmosphere would, if compressed to the pressure at the earth's surface, be a layer about one-eighth of an inch thick.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a tiny amount of gas which is the only gas that is protecting us from the harmful UV radiation. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given what we know about the ozone and trace gas/chemistry/climate problem, we should recognize that we are conducting a global-scale experiment on the earth's atmosphere without fully understanding the consequences. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the physical and chemical processes that control the distribution of atmospheric ozone. However, we must recognize that significant uncertainties in our knowledge remain, and that these can only be resolved through a vigorous program of research.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving our Planet</EMPHASIS>, presented to a United Nations Environment Program conference in Nairobi in 1992, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Observing changes in the chemistry of the stratosphere caused by the release of trace gases is difficult. Therefore, theoretical models have been developed to estimate such changes. The models developed in the 1970s estimated that continued release of chlorofluorocarbons at late 1970s rates, if continued indefinitely, would deplete stratospheric ozone by about 15 per cent, with an uncertainty range of 6 to 22 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the figures are very sloppy; they are all over the place. We are going on a 1970s model. The paper also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are several limitations to these theoretical models and it has been pointed out that such models might be underestimating the adverse impact of CFCs on ozone, especially at high latitudes in winter.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World-wide ozone monitoring (ground-based total ozone monitoring) began during the International Geophysical Year in 1957, but only a very few stations have continuous records from 1957 to the present day. One of these stations is Halley Bay, Antarctica. Records from Halley Bay show that the total ozone levels above the station in 1984 were only about 60 per cent as large as those obtained in the late 1950s and early 1960s . . . The changes were most pronounced in October. Recent studies . . . have indicated an average decrease of 30-40 per cent in the total column of ozone in the lower stratosphere between 15 and 20 km. above Antarctica (referred to as the ozone hole) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So once again we have the problem that we have one base station which has been measuring ozone since 1957 and our knowledge of the ozone layer is very thin at least. Yet there is evidence coming to hand that this is a serious problem. In December 1991 it was reported by Reuters in Chile:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Blinded sheep and sunburned schoolchildren in southern Chile are signs that ozone depletion over the Antarctic is endangering populated areas of the planet.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say that it was a pear-shaped hole in the ozone layer which affected that continent perhaps more than Australia. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chilean scientists, citing US satellite data, say depletion was worse this year than ever and reduced the ozone layer by two-thirds over the South Pole in October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The ozone hole was far deeper and covered a much larger area than in previous years' . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So once again we have mounting evidence, and yet in some ways it is not good enough. The scientific effort that is going into it is too shallow. The article goes on&mdash;and we get into the unscientific part of it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experts fear UV radiation may also cause ecological damage by stunting plant growth and disrupting the balance of the ocean ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again we have the idea that something is happening but we are not sure about it. Then there are the newspaper reports which seem to jump all over the place but once again tend to run down the risk that we face, particularly in Australia. One March 1992 article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But melanoma experts warned yesterday that increased ultraviolet radiation, resulting from a reduced ozone layer, would add to what has become a health crisis. For the first time last year, melanoma in Queensland was the commonest-recorded cancer, pushing cancer of the large bowel into second place.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> said in June 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A discovery that the ability of plants to help counter the greenhouse effect may be undermined by man-made damage to the ozone layer . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is once again speculation. To show how the statistics jump around the place, it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> back in March of 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrival of the ozone-depleted air over Melbourne was difficult to discern against a background of natural, weather-induced variations of up to 10 or 15 per cent in daily ozone levels.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a fluctuation is going on out there that we do not fully understand. It seems to me that there is an urgent need for the scientific world to look at this in greater depth, and more money should be made available for that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> ran an article in February 1992 entitled `More Bad News in the Air: An ozone "hole" over America and Europe?' In other words, it is now no longer restricted to the Southern Hemisphere; it has moved into the Northern Hemisphere. Suddenly in February of 1992 there was the headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, `Good news at last on CFCing of the ozone layer'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists on both sides of the equator have detected the first signs of success in efforts to save the ozone layer, with marked falls in the rate at which ozone-depleting chemicals are building up in the atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, Australian scientists are confident that the rapid increase in chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, emissions in the southern hemisphere has slowed significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), pointed out to us that industry has been very responsible in this area, and worldwide it has taken action that is far in advance of what has been recommended by government. But once again I believe that headline is misleading. It is misleading because it really does not show, based on a scientific background, where we are heading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a look at what has been happening in Australia and what the Australian Government has been doing, and I draw the House's attention to the Australian Environment Council's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy for Ozone Protection</EMPHASIS>. There are 106 recommendations in this particular booklet. Let me just read parts of them to give honourable members an idea of their flavour: recommendation No. 6, `Ban the manufacture and import of'; No. 9, `Ban the manufacture and import'; No.10, `Ban the manufacture and import of extruded'; No. 13, `Ban the manufacture of moulded polyurethane foams'; and over the page, No. 39, `Adopt a government approved industry code of practice'. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of the 106 recommendations in here, there is one vital link missing. It is a matter that the Government ought to take up. I thought I would go and have a look at what the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) had to say when she introduced this Bill. The very last lines of her speech say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this Government considers protection of the ozone layer to be of the very highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA>That is nonsense. It is sheer rhetoric. Why do I say that? I have gone back further in the Minister's speech looking for the missing link. The missing link is quite simply about funding scientific endeavour. This is what the Minister had to say during her speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department has recently commissioned a joint study by the University of Wollongong and the CSIRO to estimate the likely impacts of these health costs to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department has been researching the impact of health costs on the Australian economy, not the ozone layer. The speech also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some industries, such as the aerosol industry, have taken a very responsible attitude and have almost completely eliminated the use of CFCs.</PARA>
<PARA>So industry has taken up the cudgels and done very well in this area, but the Government has not. I went through the Minister's press releases to see whether somewhere there was a glimmer of an indication that she is serious about attacking this problem with scientific endeavour.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her news release headed `$80 million Overseas Environment Program', the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An $80 million four year program to provide environment assistance overseas was announced today by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to ozone depletion, Australia would make a further contribution of $2.5 million in 1991/1992 to the fund set up under the Montreal Protocol to facilitate the transfer of ozone friendly technology to developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an amount of $2.5m out of $80m. The Minister  is not serious. She is not serious in funding the fight against what could be one of the most dangerous problems that is facing this nation today. I urge the Government to look at the funding that it is putting into this area and to look at its priorities again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, until we get good scientific evidence and know where we are going with the hole in the ozone layer, reports such as I have read out show that there is a great misunderstanding and a great depth of opinion which is not consistent. We are still using computer models from the 1970s. We still have not got enough research stations, and we are still not using enough satellite data to show how serious the problem is and whether we really are coming to grips with it. I urge the Government to look again at its priorities, to cut out the rhetoric, and to put some real funding into combating this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in entering this debate on the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill. I made some notes when listening to the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) as he led for the coalition, and I acknowledge that he emphasised the bipartisan agreement about this legislation. I reflected upon the debate back in late 1988 when the original ozone protection legislation was discussed. In my opening remarks then I took to task the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)&mdash;who in this place led for the coalition&mdash;for the fact that he had made some very partisan comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken on board the comments that the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Riggall) has made. I make the observation that it would be of great concern to people, when considering the total effect of the perceived Opposition policies in public expenditure, whether what is called for by the honourable member&mdash;which I think would have some agreement on both sides of the House&mdash;would be able to be put in place, given the types of cutback to the public sector that would be envisaged under any proposals that might be put in place by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the contribution of the honourable member for Pearce he quoted from some documents that quite rightly indicated that there was continuing debate about the question of ozone depletion and the actual causes. This was a theme that the honourable member for McMillan took up in his contribution. The honourable member for Pearce, by illustration, quite rightly quoted that we cannot really wait to get definitive answers on a lot of the unanswered questions; we must most definitely act. That is not to say that this continuing exploration of what is involved with the phenomenon of ozone depletion is not required; it is to say that if we do not act now and if we find in general that the hypotheses put forward about this phenomenon are correct, we will have lost valuable time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the observation back in 1988 that, even with the action we take now, because of the time that gases such as chlorofluorocarbons take to get into the stratosphere where they have an impact, we will not see any immediate action. There are some estimates that, even if we meet the targets that have been set down by the Montreal protocol, if we do not use some of the other gases on which there is still debate about their appropriateness, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, it will still be towards the middle and perhaps late in the next century before ozone levels will get back to their normal levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already it is interesting to see how in this period since the first Montreal protocol in 1987 different countries view ozone layer depletion. I quote <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>from the statement of the conference on the changing atmosphere implications for global security held in June 1988 in Toronto, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the last decade, a decline of 3% in the ozone layer has occurred at mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere, possibly accompanying the appearance of the Antarctic ozone hole; although there is more meteorological variability, there are indications that a smaller decline has occurred in the Northern Hemisphere.</PARA>
<PARA>At that time it was thought that the major and most significant depletion occurred in the Southern Hemisphere and, for a variety of reasons that had been put forward in explanation, actually occurred over Antarctica. Of recent times, it has been clearly indicated by some of the studies that NASA has conducted that there is a myriad of areas of significant ozone depletion in the Northern Hemisphere and that, in fact, they are not centred on the Arctic Pole but clearly are in various locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of interest is the fact that part of the work that NASA is doing at the moment indicated that, even more than in the case of the so-called Antarctic holes, one of the greatest areas of depletion was actually over the State of Maine in the United States. The Minister, in talking to the recent conference about ozone, illustrated that this was a cause for perhaps the United States taking a bit more action. There was an observation that the holiday residence of the President of the United States, recently washed away by tidal action, was a place that now could be most likely affected by ozone depletion. Some of President Bush's political foes in the United States have, perhaps rather cruelly, suggested that the focus put on it by the present US Administration is as a result of that evidence coming to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that if we look at the history of action against ozone depletion in the global sense, we see that it has been one very much of global international cooperation. It is one of those environmental questions where we have seen great action and cooperation at inter-governmental levels. Perhaps that does not need to be stated on something of which people appear to have, in the general sense, a great knowledge through the popular media, both through newspapers and magazine articles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequences of the depletion of ozone are great. One direct consequence of ozone depletion is greater ultraviolet radiation penetration. With respect to the health of humans, this causes acute and long term changes to the skin. Acute changes include sunburn, enhanced skin pigmentation and skin thickening. Chronic changes include acceleration of the ageing process and skin cancers. There is also evidence that the action of ultraviolet radiation, UVR, can affect the immune system in the skin. Therefore, it can increase susceptibility to diseases such as herpes and some of the protozoal infections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we attempt to put a cost on some of these things, we will find that the cost can be great. For instance, the primary treatment for the removal of a simple cutaneous malignant melanoma might cost, in 1990 Australian dollar terms, about $3,500. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the treatment would cost a further $10,000. For those who are terminally ill, it would cost a further $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average cost of treating a monocular senile cataract is about $2,500. If we consider that in Australia a one per cent increase in ultraviolet radiation would increase the incidence of senile cataracts by eight cases per 10,000 people, we can see the multiple effect of this significant environmental phenomenon. Currently an estimated 140,000 Australians are treated for non-melanoma skin cancers every year. For every one per cent increase in UVR, a corresponding increase of about 2,500 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers is expected. This could lead to an additional four to six deaths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations body, UNEP, has estimated that a sustained 10 per cent reduction in ozone would result overall in a 26 per cent increase in non-melanoma skin cancers world wide. That would be equivalent to more than 300,000 additional cases. This is not a situation that we can treat lightly. It is a situation that requires concerted effort, not only by government, but also by industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate a lot has been said about the efforts of a number of the players who were involved&mdash;and congratulations, quite rightly, have been given to them. For instance, in the 1988 debate I made reference to how some of the actions that were being considered by different governments were being distorted by consideration of whether manufacturers of chlorofluorocarbons were under their jurisdiction. Now we see the movement to where those manufacturers&mdash;the honourable member for Pearce used the Du Pont organisation as an example&mdash;have moved to ensure that they are able to protect their market share with products that could replace those which use CFCs, by exploring and working on safer alternatives that can be developed for the use of all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Toward the end of his contribution, the honourable member for McMillan made comments developing his theme that perhaps what the Minister has said was only rhetoric and that it was not being backed up by action. The only thing he could find that the Government said it would do was to put money forward to assist some of our developing neighbouring countries in tackling this problem. I think that effort is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what is going on in current political debate is about how Australia relates to its most immediate neighbours, how it acts in relation to some of its previously important ties with other countries. Significantly, if we look at this phenomenon and we understand that Australia as a nation, whilst having high per capita use of the types of gases that lead to ozone depletion, in total, in the global sense, we will see that it uses less than 2 per cent of those gases. The reduction of that use, meeting the targets that we have set, meeting any future targets that might be set by amendments to the Montreal protocol, overall will have an effect only at the margins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, as a developed country, has an obligation to be involved in setting examples for its neighbours, for other countries that, because of their economic situation, require that type of assistance. If we make an analysis of the worldwide use of CFCs, halons and so on, those gases which are listed in the legislation, we will find that many countries will have great difficulty in making the movements that are required. The body speaking on behalf of the supermarket industry spoke of the difficulties it might have in moving towards the changeover of gases. That gives us an example in the Australian economic context. It is valid to compare us with countries with weaker economies&mdash;they will have much more difficulty in meeting the targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that Australia gives the lead, that Australia is involved in what is going on in the region, in what is going on in other countries. That involvement can occur in many ways, whether by conducting trials of new products or developing new techniques that might lead to the proper transfer of these gases from obsolete equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that has always been foreseen is that a lot of the worldwide stock of these gases is contained in older refrigeration units. As these refrigeration units end their lives, they are often disposed of in inappropriate ways. One has only to visit a local municipal tip to see what the ironmongers can get from snaffling up a few obsolete refrigerators. The coils at the back of the refrigerators contain the types of gases, the manufacture and import of which will be minimised by legislation such as this. We really have to come to grips with the way in which we handle those stockpiles, so that the gases do not escape and make their tortuous journey finally into the stratosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a problem that, as I said from the outset, has been characterised by two things. First, in the Australian context, it has been characterised by an overwhelming bipartisan view on the way in which we work together to achieve something in the Federal sense and through the required State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the questions that have been posed by the honourable member for Pearce about the Government having the potential to give a lead with its activities through departments and statutory authorities. I suppose that is always something that arises in the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I note that the Chair of that Committee, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh), and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) are in the chamber. Even you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a previous member of the Committee, would know that one of the recurring themes as we go around Australia is that the activities of Australian government departments are questioned. I can remember in our coastal inquiry that questions were often asked about whether government establishments were actually doing the right thing in the way that they disposed of their wastes. I think that is something we can take on board to perhaps ensure that government departments are doing the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that is of importance in this overall debate is global cooperation, international cooperation. In no other phenomena, besides perhaps greenhouse, can the axiom of thinking globally and acting locally be more important. It is to be hoped that this continuing cooperation will be carried out and that we will be able to tackle this and other problems that cross boundaries in the same friendly and cooperative manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the interesting things about this small debate, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has just stated, is that all of us taking part in the debate in one way or another have an abiding concern for the environment and ecological management. We may differ on certain points, but I think it is fair to say that all of us are in agreement on most issues that come before the House. All of us in this debate have the job of impressing our colleagues in our respective parties with our views so that, hopefully, they will become their views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ozone Protection Amendment Bill before us today is an extension of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 and will enable the strengthening of domestic legislation with a view to our continuing to honour international commitments in the protection of the global environment. I am referring here specifically to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which was ratified by Australia in 1987 with bipartisan support. This should be a clear indication that we still have bipartisan support on this very vital&mdash;not just national but international&mdash;issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted that Australia's role in ozone protection has been exemplary. In this regard we have successfully led the way in bringing about a reduction in our use of ozone depleting substances. Industry in Australia has led the way, and this should be remembered when we point out that Australia has already accepted the target date of 1997, three years ahead of the protocol deadline. Our consumption of CFCs last year was half that of 1986, which puts Australia four years ahead of the protocol timetable. Full marks, therefore, must go to Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australia consumes less than 2 per cent of the world's CFCs and is therefore a small player, as the previous speaker also mentioned, as one of the few developed nations in the Southern Hemisphere where the problem of the ozone hole was first discovered the onus is still upon us as a developed nation to continue to lead the way. It is our responsibility to continue to encourage smaller and less developed nations by example to achieve the targets set by international agreements. Evidently the cost to these communities would be far more significant in relative terms than the cost to our own community priorities, but it is our job to convince them, these smaller countries, of the urgency of this matter and to continue to encourage their compliance in achieving these international targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that in June 1990 the parties to the Montreal protocol met in London where 11 new substances, the most important of which was methyl chloroform&mdash;which is also one of the few I can pronounce&mdash;were brought in under the provisions of the protocol. The Bill we have before us today extends the controls set by the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to encompass these additional substances and will enable Australia to give effect to these 1990 amendments. It does also permit future revisions of the protocol to be implemented by regulation rather than requiring amendment to the original Act. I personally have some concerns about this and would say that the Opposition supports the proposals put forward, although we will be wary of the exercise of these new regulatory powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should remind the House that the coalition has in fact been ahead of the Government in this regard, as the records show. We moved amendments in the debate on the Ozone Protection Bill 1989, urging industry to achieve faster and greater reductions in the production and use of ozone depleting substances than was provided for in the protocol. Let me repeat that the Ozone Protection Act was passed with coalition support in May 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has a formal policy commitment to phase out the use of CFCs by 1995, five years ahead of the Montreal protocol and two years ahead of the Government's present position. We believe that by and large industry has taken steps to deal with the problem, and there is no doubt that Government-industry cooperation in this field has been extremely good in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would, however, like to support the remarks made by my colleague the honourable member for Pearce in calling for greater action on the part of the Commonwealth Government to present the public with a detailed and fully costed strategy for the phase-out of its own use of CFCs. I understand that plans are well advanced for handling the phase-out of halons as are proposals for a national storage facility and discussions about destruction technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, though, no such stage has been reached with respect to CFCs. The Commonwealth Government is the biggest single user of CFCs in the country, with its transport fleets, property holdings and the daily activities of it and its agencies. It is imperative that, in exhorting industry and the private sector to take action in finding substitutes for ozone depleting substances, the Commonwealth at the very least should set the example with some action to match its own rhetoric. As far as we know, no such master plan for a costed phase-out strategy of CFC use exists. If it does, it should be made publicly available immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that Commonwealth holdings of CFCs may total as much as 10,000 tonnes. The cost of destruction and replacement of this material would be enormous. We understand the problem. One of the first logical steps, therefore, it would seem to me, is to get a thorough inventory made up of the Commonwealth's use of CFCs and as detailed an estimate as possible of the cost of their replacement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a company such as Du Pont can make an investment in the order of $US1 billion in CFC alternatives it demonstrates that it already has accepted a high degree of responsibility in tackling the problem. Du Pont has set for the world, not just for Australia, the example of the way we should all go. If I may digress for a moment, I would say that the role of Du Pont in Australia should be a standard for all industry. I have attended these Asia-Pacific forums for the last two years, and the degree to which large industry in Australia has met this Montreal protocol program has become increasingly evident to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent scientific evidence has shown that ozone losses are now occurring in all areas of the globe, and a renewed sense of urgency has been brought about by the possibility of an ozone hole appearing in the Northern Hemisphere this year. Following NASA's assessment of ozone loss and the possibility of a deep ozone hole appearing over the north-eastern part of the United States this northern spring, President Bush has announced an accelerated phase-out for CFCs. We are told that the United States is now committed to ending all CFC production by 1995. The European Community had already brought the date of its phase-out forward to 1997, and there is a strong possibility that it, too, will now bring its date forward to 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the recent positions taken by the USA and the Europeans correspond with decisions already taken here, and especially with the Opposition's long-established policies. It is unfortunate, but totally consistent with human nature, that it takes a crisis to reach a certain level of urgency and immediate relevance before any action is taken. It is interesting that the United States procrastinated so long on the matter until the prospects of a hole directly over the United States saw President Bush and the United States Congress move with amazing rapidity to comply with international moves and trends. By the same token, it is my hope that President Bush might see fit to attend the forthcoming Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit and sign a treaty to fight global warming in spite of election pressures back home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 18 months before the Government settled on its emission reduction target in late 1990, the coalition had adopted a position that there would be a 20 per cent reduction by the year 2000. Our target is tougher than the Government's aims to stabilise emissions by the end of the century and reduce them by 20 per cent by the year 2005. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When mentioning these figures, it should be borne in mind that they have the total support of Australian industry. There is no conflict between industry and Government proposals in this regard. When we are talking about this matter, we should bear in mind the great steps that industry has taken. Admittedly, there has been some level of forcing, but the effort of industry is something that we should be very proud of and happy with because so often there is so much misinformation spread with regard to greenhouse effects, the ozone effect and the realisation of industry to follow it. Industry in Australia has taken this lead and has not had to be coerced very heavily by the Government. It makes me proud to be an Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my remarks in the limited time available by affirming the Opposition's support for this legislation. It does involve some new regulatory powers which the coalition will be watching carefully. We do believe that this legislation is in keeping with international trends and is consistent with maintaining Australia's lead and example in this field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to support the Ozone Protection Amendment Bill, which is before the House, and to concentrate on two broad themes about the continued depletion of our ozone layer. The first theme is the need for Australia to recognise properly that the continued depletion of the ozone layer is a critical issue which remains potentially catastrophic and which demands positive government intervention and strict regulation if we are to see an end to depletion and protection of our atmosphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second theme is the need for Australia to recognise its international obligations in the area of ozone depletion, to set an example for the rest of the world and, perhaps more importantly, to assist those developing countries where compliance with international protocols would harm their domestic economies to a far greater extent than could ever occur in a developed nation such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point concerns the continuation of the problem: that is, the layer of ozone in our stratosphere which protects life on earth from potentially fatal levels of ultraviolet radiation is still being depleted at an unacceptable rate. So many of my colleagues who have spoken today have expressed pleasure and pride that we are doing what we are doing. I, too, join them in that. It is very important, though, to recognise that the problem is continuing and that the depletion is still occurring at an unacceptable rate. I share very much the sentiments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), in our delight that, for once, we are tackling the problem; but, of course, it still exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 14 March this year by science and technology reporter, Graeme O'Neill, graphically illustrated the seriousness with which we should continue to view this problem. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In just one decade, rising ultraviolet-B-radiation caused by ozone depletion over temperate Australia has put people in Melbourne at the same potential risk of severe summer sunburn and skin cancer as people in subtropical Brisbane. Melbourne's average summer levels of UV-B radiation have risen by 8 per cent since 1980, while Hobart's have risen by 11 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>We always think of those down in Melbourne not ever having to wear shorts, not having to worry about the sun as the rest of us do&mdash;indeed, not even being able to go to the beach as the rest of us do&mdash;but they are suffering as we do in Brisbane and Sydney. I would assume that there are increases of similar magnitude around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such increases in UV radiation around the country will inevitably impact on the health of the Australian people. Recent alarming statistics regarding skin cancer rates illustrate that such impacts are occurring already. In New South Wales in 1974, the rate of so-called invasive melanomas was 15.6 per 100,000 people. By 1982, that figure had risen to 17.6 and, in 1989, it was 28.1&mdash;that is, the number of skin cancers had almost doubled in only 15 years. Yes, the honourable member for Cook and I in our more mature years are discovering that even we, who lived in the sun without worrying, are developing these skin cancers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures from Queensland and Victoria show similar trends. Melanoma experts are continuing to warn that continued ozone depletion will exacerbate the problem. To put it very bluntly: more and more Australians will die from skin cancers. While talking of the effects of this ozone depletion on us as humans, it might be important to mention that higher levels of UVB due to depletion of the ozone layer also cause a reduction in the ability of plants to photosynthesise. This could, in fact, lead to lower crop yields which could have an enormous economic impact in Australia. Unlike humans, of course, the plants cannot put on a hat or a sunscreen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those preventative and educational campaigns about hats and sunscreens in relation to people have been extensive and will, I am sure, help to reduce, or at least slow, the rate of increase in skin cancers and, indeed, melanomas. But they are only preventative. Wearing hats and good sunscreens, while excellent protection in themselves, simply will not solve the underlying problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the ozone protection policies of the world come in. In 1988, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was signed and came into effect. Australia ratified that protocol and enacted the Ozone Protection Act 1989 to ensure it had effect in Australia. I need not go into the detail about the phase-out timetable which was adopted in that legislation as other colleagues have done that, except to say that it created the necessary framework to achieve a quick and orderly ban on the manufacture, sale and import of these ozone depleting substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the protocol was amended and strengthened in view of the most recent scientific evidence. This new protocol sets the year 2000 as the 100 per cent phase-out target for CFCs, halons and carbon tetrachloride, and the year 2005 for the 100 per cent phrase-out of methyl chloroform. We ought to note that the protocol will most likely be amended and strengthened again after a further review due in November 1992. This may bring forward the phase-out date either to 1997 or 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill currently before the House seeks to amend our domestic laws to take account of the changes to the international protocol and to introduce flexibility to enable new and faster phase-out dates to be adopted quickly. Since enactment of the 1988 legislation, Australia has achieved a great deal in this area, of which we are justly proud. We are well placed to reduce CFC consumption to about only 10 per cent of the 1986 levels by 1995. As of this year, and other colleagues have mentioned this too, we have reduced the 1986 levels by some 50 per cent&mdash;four years ahead of the 1990 amended protocol target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable members have mentioned a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> under the headline `Good news at last on CFCing of the ozone layer'. In that article, Bob Beale said that scientists in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres had detected a slowdown in the accumulation of ozone depleters in the atmosphere. He said that the NASA working group on CFCs and halons has indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . concentrations of CFCs at middle and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere have started to level off, presumably in response to reduced emissions.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that the Northern Hemisphere is responsible for some 95 per cent of the total global emissions, this is good news. It is extremely encouraging to those who want to increase our work in Australia. The point to stress is that this evidence should not in any way make us complacent about the task which still confronts us. The previously steep rate of increase has started to level off&mdash;not fall, but level off. We have to keep remembering that that is all that has happened. In other words, the amount of ozone depleting substances accumulating in our atmosphere is still increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill should be supported by Parliament&mdash;and I am glad that it is&mdash;because it imposes a very necessary and perfectly achievable set of regulations to achieve an eventual ban on these harmful substances. The obligations imposed on us by the international community are quite clear and we should take them very seriously. If we can go further in the way we have to date, we should accelerate our phase-out program. This new legislation will facilitate this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned that another crucial point which must be made is that it is largely the developed world which has caused this threat to our atmosphere, as is the case with global warming causing the greenhouse effect. Other colleagues have also stressed that. Australia is part of that developed world and, as such, has an important international role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The developing nations also are obviously very much aware of the global issues involved in the destruction of the ozone layer. I am firmly of the view that they do have a right, however, to expect the industrialised world to assist them in meeting the timetable imposed by the Montreal protocol. Such assistance may mean financial and/or technological assistance of some kind. Developed nations have an obvious enormous financial and technological advantage over the developing nations, in terms of already having the capacity to absorb any change in manufacturing practices which would be necessary to meet phase-out targets. That advantage should be shared across the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example is China. Apparently, that country makes refrigerators, used domestically, which use ozone depleting substances as refrigerants. Under the Montreal protocol, China would be required to phase out the use of such substances over the next decade. However, in the absence of replacement refrigerants, its ability to make refrigerators would also come to an end. In short, what right does the developed world have to promote a regulatory regime which would deny the Chinese population access to refrigeration? It has no moral right unless it assists the Chinese, financially if necessary, to develop and manufacture suitable alternatives. The developed world must also accept its current failure to adequately fund research and development of alternative refrigerant technologies which would be used in both the developed and the developing worlds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal has been made of the work of Du Pont, amongst others, in that area. I will say a few words on research and development of new technologies. At present, corporations such as ICI and Du Pont, already referred to by the honourable member for Cook, are directing funding towards chemical substitutes for CFCs. As the honourable member said, they should be congratulated on doing that. He also said that it should perhaps set the model. I think we could go a little further than that, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Du Pont has developed new fluorocarbons&mdash;HCFCs and CFCs&mdash;which it says are ozone friendly. That is not quite so. It is true that HCFCs cause only one-twentieth the damage to the ozone layer that CFCs do. Initially, that seems to be a very reassuring figure, but when we consider that the Chinese are beginning to introduce refrigeration to one-quarter of the world's population, it is obvious that even that level of one-twentieth is too high. We must be able to go better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for non-chemical-based refrigerants is almost non-existent. Technologies, such as ammonia based refrigerants, which were used before the introduction of CFCs are given little development funding. ICI was one of the biggest manufacturers in that area using ammonia based refrigerants. Surely, that is where the research should be going now. Even though it is claimed that there are problems with toxicity&mdash;and I am sure there are problems&mdash;surely research should be conducted to try to solve that problem. We must encourage industry to break the chemical habit once and for all and to direct funding towards non-chemical refrigerants and cooling systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, I am very much aware of the tensions which these sorts of issues can generate in international forums. The regulatory demands of the developed world&mdash;more often than not, those countries are the very nations whose behaviour necessitates the regulations in the first place&mdash;can be seen as imposing what are extremely harmful short term obligations on developing nations. This can be a gross form of global inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember attending a conference a couple of years ago on global warming, as a member of Parliamentarians for Global Action, at which the issue of ozone depletion was also raised. A woman from a developing country said to all of us at this conference, `How can you impose your regulations on us when a whole village in my country does not produce as many gasses and emissions as one person in your country with his car, his refrigerator and his air-conditioning'&mdash;for once I will use the male term. The problem was set out so starkly when she said that a whole village in her country&mdash;dozens and dozens of people&mdash;would not cause the same problems and have the same effect on global warming and the ozone layer as one person in our country with all our modern appliances. So we can see the gross form of global inequity that can be caused by our imposing regulations without offering the technological and financial assistance that we owe those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not wish to underestimate the concerns expressed by, for example, the Australian Supermarket Institute, which has been referred to before and which is concerned about the availability of alternative refrigerants for commercial freezers, I believe we should see them in the proper context&mdash;that is, Australia's global responsibility. While the Government is committed to consulting affected industries about the implementation of the phase-out timetable, just as the Minister assured them in her second reading speech and as we will all agree and understand, our first commitment must remain that of protecting the ozone layer, which is about the protection of the world as well as of ourselves and working within international forums to assist other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time that we have said, in this House and elsewhere, that issues affecting the environment are global issues. It is these issues which, perhaps for the first time, can unite countries throughout the world to work together, assisting each other, because the problems eventually affect us all. In areas such as this, we cannot put up our sovereign boundaries and say that we can stay within them and remain unaffected or that what we do will not affect others. These are global issues. I am very proud, as other honourable members have been, of our efforts to date in this area. I am confident that we will proceed along those lines, but we must also remember our global responsibilities. </PARA>

The implementation of an ozone protection strategy in Australia, of which this Bill is an integral part has, indeed, been an example of what can be achieved when governments, the community and industry work together.

The regulations will not come into force for Australia until they are adopted internationally and they will be subject to the normal parliamentary disallowance procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that I noted the comments about Commonwealth activities. I assure honourable members that our intention is for the Commonwealth to play its part in the  implementation of the ozone protection strategy. There is a recognition among government users of the need to develop strategies appropriate to their own operations. This is taking place in the Department of Defence, for instance. I remind honourable members that Commonwealth agencies are bound by the Montreal protocol and by Commonwealth legislation. We cannot pretend that Commonwealth agencies are without fault, and I assure the House that the Commonwealth is fully aware of not only its responsibilities but also of the community and industry's quite justified expectation that we should show leadership in this endeavour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point the honourable member raised was whether the Commonwealth would continue to work closely with industry and make sure that alternatives were practical and available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I would like to put in perspective the size of the freight task because the National Rail Corporation will be handling freight. Let us look at the two tables. In the first table we see that government rail accounts for less than 20 per cent of the tonne kilometres of freight carted in this nation. In tonnage terms, government rail is taking less than 11 per cent; in other words, a relatively small amount. We should not allow this to be put out of perspective. If we look at the total government rail freight services that are provided, we find that the National Rail Corporation will only be accounting for about 12 per cent of the total rail freight currently being carried in this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the inefficiencies that are currently being faced were put very succinctly by the former Prime Minister in an example he gave of taking cargo from Sydney to Perth by rail. Those inefficiencies are due to the fact that it goes through three non-integrated rail systems, which is one reason this matter needs to be addressed urgently by the National Rail Corporation. Those inefficiencies included: four locomotive changes, five safe working zones, six different sized loading gauges, 10 different engineering standards of the basic standard gauge rail track and 12 or more hours being spent at sidings for crew changes, refuelling or inspections. Clearly, we have some major problems in trying to get an efficient service running across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at our passenger services&mdash;at this stage they are not part of the National Rail Corporation, although they may be in the future&mdash;we find that the cost recovery on our passenger services is alarmingly low. It varies from 16 to 36 per cent; in other words, for every $1 spent in providing that service only between 16c and 36c is recovered from those using the service. It is a standing joke that it costs more for Australian National to send a person from Sydney to Perth on the Indian Pacific than to give him a first-class air ticket. That was, of course, before deregulation came. Since then, as everyone is well aware, it has become increasingly difficult to attract passengers to use that train at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the size of this loss, it is worth asking the Government why, after nine years, it continues to tolerate losses of over $4 billion a year. Put in another perspective, the loss is $11m per day, $450,000 per hour or at least three times a backbencher's annual salary just while I am speaking in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems go on and on. I will just give a couple of anecdotal examples. The Indian Pacific is known to be losing over $1m just in theft from the train. In Melbourne there are still over 40 hand operated road crossings; someone has to physically close the gates every time the train comes through. In Victoria we have an even more ludicrous situation: union rules have dictated that, when an electric light globe blows at the station of Dimboola, which is west of Horsham, the station of Ararat, which is nearly two hours drive away, is rung up and an electrician drives up by car to change it. This is the sort of nonsense that is going on in our railways, which is adding to the costs. In Victoria, we have recently seen that ticketing machines are being installed, but they are only being installed in booking offices where they are manually operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some complaints about whether or not rail has had sufficient expenditure. The States have put some money into rail. The Industry Commission has estimated that rail had its fair share of capital expenditure in the 1980s. In total terms, when we look at all the contributions&mdash;not so much from the Commonwealth&mdash;28.2 per cent of the combined road and rail funding has gone into rail. The problem, of course, is that so much of that has been squandered, because of the losses that have soaked up any spare funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interstate freight system loses over $350m per year&mdash;about $1m every day. That is some achievement for freight, where clearly the competitor&mdash;road transport&mdash;has to meet cost recovery, otherwise it does not survive. As I said earlier, we are talking about the National Rail Corporation achieving 12 per cent&mdash;and that is all&mdash;of the total rail freight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put this into a national perspective and talk about the importance of achieving reform in our transport systems. A joint study in March 1989 by the Industries Assistance Commission, as it was then, and the Business Council of Australia showed that reform in transport could lead to national savings of $3.2 billion, and it could lift national output by $6 billion, or 2.3 per cent, in the long run. This in itself could lead to an increase in real wages of about 3 per cent; we could see the Government surplus increase by about $1 billion; real consumption could increase by $720 per household; and the benefits of this would be three times as great as the abolition of all tariffs. Obviously, that is a very important reform if we can achieve it. In other words, transport reform in itself can do more to assist this nation than the whole tariff debate. Of those $3.2 billion worth of savings that were identified by the IAC and the BCA, 40 per cent would come from efficiency improvements in our railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in February 1990 the Business Council published further work of the IAC on the benefits of micro-economic reform and concluded that reform in transport, communications and electricity generation, collectively, could increase our GDP by a staggering $16 billion, or 5 per cent, over 10 years. This could lead to an increase of about $1,600 in the average household income, and 60 per cent of these gains would come from transport reform. It is also noted that inflation would fall by 2.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a report on competitiveness released last year the Business Council credits Australia's transport costs as one of the major impediments to our export performance. I say again to the Government: what an indictment on nine years of government, and we are still only just starting to look at it. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through regulation of the domestic transport industry (outside road) we have missed opportunities to cash in on our comparative advantage in long distance transport.</PARA>
<PARA>In the largely deregulated road transport industry, the opposite has occurred, and we are acknowledged as world leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the legislation itself. The National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1992 will allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement signed on 30 July last year by the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The agreement itself is set out in schedule 1 of the Bill. I hasten to add that Western Australia has yet to pass the legislation but supports that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties to that agreement said that the company would be established for the purpose of conducting interstate rail freight operations in Australia on a commercial basis in accordance with the principles compatible with those set out in the heads of agreement on the National Rail Freight Corporation of 31 October 1990. The principles are: that the company will operate on a strictly commercial basis, which is very important; have access to the requisite assets; operate under labour agreements that reflect best practice in productivity standards&mdash;and I will come back to that very important point; be able to contract activities where appropriate; and provide access to its network and facilities to public and private sector operators, which I am sure my colleague the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) is very pleased to hear about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Good. It will be able to provide service to governments on a strictly commercial basis; and not be in any way responsible for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities resulting from its formation and operation&mdash;again a very important point in light of some of the discussions that have been going on in recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that, while these may sound admirable goals, they are essential if the Corporation is to be commercially successful. That is a very important and fundamental point about the whole operations of the National Rail Corporation. Part B of the principles states that during the establishment period of five years the current financial position of the Commonwealth and the State rail authorities interstate rail freight operations will not deteriorate as a result of the Commonwealth and the States participating in the formation and operation of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Bill establishes the operating framework for the National Rail Corporation in so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The Bill goes on to say that the National Rail Corporation will be subject to all rates, taxes and charges, will not have the shield of the Crown and will be treated as an ordinary incorporated company, including being subject to the Trade Practices Act. Again, all of them are admirable goals, but they are imperative if the Corporation is to be truly commercial and to promote fair competition between transport modes. The Bill goes on to provide for the transfer to the National Rail Corporation of assets owned or leased by the Commonwealth or Australian National Railways&mdash;provided the South Australian Government allows it&mdash;and it also provides for substituting the National Rail Corporation for the Commonwealth or AN in cases where legislative transfer of assets or contracts have been agreed in accordance with the shareholders' agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill represents the first step&mdash;a small step&mdash;towards achieving efficiency gains in rail that may ensure the survival of rail itself. But, as I said earlier, it only accounts for 12 per cent of rail freight. Clearly, reform of land transport in Australia is a key priority in the micro-economic rehabilitation of this country. It has been estimated that if we could get a world-class transport system GDP would be increased by over 2 per cent, and $4.4 billion of this potential gain would come from rail itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Industry Commission in its 1991 report estimated that moving to international best practice in management and work practices, and basing rail investment decisions on commercial objectives rather than political objectives&mdash;and it is worth noting that in light of the February statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;would increase the GDP by a massive $5 billion a year. That is around $300 for every man, woman and child in Australia every year. Clearly, with those sorts of losses it is obvious that rail reform is in dire need. If rail hopes to survive into the next century Australia cannot continue to fund these rail deficits. To their credit, rail employees, unions and management are coming to realise this. But, unfortunately, as I alluded to a minute ago, the Government has not learned to keep its nose out of rail decisions. This was supposed to be a first step towards moving away from political interference in too many of our rail decisions. In February the Prime Minister came along with his funding statement but, instead of asking the National Rail Corporation to make a commercial decision, he directed where those funds would be spent. Just by coincidence, much of what was spent was being spent in Victoria and South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the projects that attracted funds in that February statement were initially not deemed to be commercially practical by the National Rail Corporation. The coalition would like to know how the National Rail Corporation is supposed to account for the February statement funding in the context of a commercial operation to achieve some rate of return. That is a very important point that the Minister ought to address in his summing up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to move very quickly to the financial impact of the legislation. Those who have followed it closely will realise that the Commonwealth has made a commitment of $295.8m up to the year 1995-96; that is nearly $300m. The Commonwealth's commitment, which is not insignificant, to make such equity contributions is in fact dependent on the National Rail Corporation meeting the agreed principles set out, particularly the labour arrangements. As I said earlier, I think this is a critical part of the whole Bill. More importantly, it is a critical part of the success of the National Rail Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now to touch on a few problems that we foresee could occur with the legislation and with the setting up of the National Rail Corporation. I will quickly run through these. Rail industry sources admit that it is going to be extremely difficult to get the cost down to the levels envisaged by the Corporation unless the governments are prepared to cooperate with the Corporation to get the changes in place quickly. This is a very important point. The agreement specifies that labour arrangements incorporated in an enterprise award, which reflects best practice in productivity standards, must be in place before&mdash;I emphasise before&mdash;any capital is committed. This is also supposed to be the commitment in relation to the February economic statement and the funding that is coming from there, although one wonders sometimes with the lack of commercial expertise that has been shown in directing some of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear to all honourable members that the coalition insists that this be enforced. We also want those productivity standards to reflect the best in the world. We see no reason why they should not. There is some concern that the Government is sliding away from world best practice of standards to something more nebulous called `best practice'. What do we mean by that? The old National Rail Freight Corporation Task Force made some fairly important observations on this. I will quickly look at a couple. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without the achievement of substantial recurrent savings, the capital investment program is unsustainable and the operating benchmarks for a profitable interstate freight network unattainable.</PARA>
<PARA>This is very clear; there is no ambiguity there. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . without work practice changes accompanying many investments, the return required of the investment is undeliverable.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to list some targets. For example, locomotive maintenance has a cost efficiency saving of at least 30 per cent; wagon maintenance has a saving of 46 per cent; fuel has a saving of 20 per cent; signalling and communications have a massive saving of 50 per cent; terminal costs have a saving of 33 per cent; track maintenance has a saving of 20 per cent; and trained crewing has a cost efficiency saving of 40 per cent. These are the sorts of savings that are achievable and these are the sorts of savings that will be needed in order to make the National Rail Corporation a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of this, equally of concern is a report from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> of 27 March which outlines the difficulties that the Corporation and the rail unions are having in coming to any agreement, let alone one that reflects world best practice. I quote briefly from that article, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Federal Secretary of the Australian Railways Union&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">said management optimism for implementation of the new award by the third quarter this year could be misplaced.</PARA>
<PARA>These are fairly strong words from the Secretary of the ARU. He also went on to ask for something that I am sure all workers would love but really I think is a little unreasonable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The union also wants rail workers coming from state rail systems into the new corporation to enjoy a 12-month `transitionary period', after which they can elect to stay with the corporation or return to their original state rail employer.</PARA>
<PARA>It sounds terrific if one could get it, but it is something that most workers can only dream about. We talk about the importance of getting an agreement in place for world best practice and say that it is critical to the success of the National Rail Corporation. We in this House seek an assurance from the Minister&mdash;and I believe it is quite reasonable and it is something that we should expect&mdash;that no Federal money is going to be committed to the National Rail Corporation, or indeed to any rail system, unless and until the industrial agreements are in place which reflect these world best standards. I hesitate to point out though that the Government's caving in on some of the difficulties facing AN on redundancies does not give us much optimism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out some of the problems. It is not clear what the shareholdings will be at the end of the five-year establishment period. But it seems that no shareholder will be able to hold more than 49 per cent of the shares. This is a most unusual agreement, particularly if the capital contributions to the Corporation do not reflect the final shareholding. Any attempt to twist or constrain the valuation of assets to ensure that no shareholder gets greater than 49 per cent of the shares will, in fact, make a farce of commercial reality. It would show only that governments are incapable of moving away from rail reform and making it commercial. One would then have to say, as my colleague the honourable member for Bruce will be pointing out, that privatisation may be the only option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions must also be asked about what happens to the leftovers of Australian National and V/Line, or VicRail, once the National Rail Corporation is operational. If any lines are commercial, or capable of being made commercial, will the National Rail Corporation be encouraged to take them over on commercial grounds? This may be impeded by a clause in the agreement which gives the States the power to decide what happens to intrastate lines. Any unprofitable or non-viable services left over which can be deemed as community services&mdash;and this should be done in consultation with local communities&mdash;should be the subject of commercial contracts with the Corporation or some private contractor. For other lines it may mean that the hard decisions will have to be faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, while the coalition does not oppose the Bill as it is perhaps the first step towards a more efficient rail system, there are a number of other concerns which I would like to quickly talk about. The first is the right of any State to revoke access to intrastate operations. Clearly, if the NRC is to take over an intrastate service with the approval of the relevant State Minister, that approval can be revoked at any time under the present case law. This could lead to less than optimal decisions. For example, Western Australia does not even refer powers to the Commonwealth in its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next one is the resolution of the disputes process. Disputes are to be resolved by conciliation in the first instance. On the failure to resolve the dispute within 28 days after the appointment of a conciliator or where there is disagreement on the question of conciliation, the dispute is to be submitted to arbitration in accordance with, and subject to, the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in force at the date of the first notification of the dispute or difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As disputes could arise if the rail authority of a State imposes a charge that appears discriminatory to interstate goods, the question arises as to whether the procedure laid down in sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution should be followed, as they would appear to override the machinery for settling disputes in respect of railways in the agreement. Section 102 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference . . . is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it provides that in deciding the reasonableness of the charge due regard should be given to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the construction and maintenance of the railways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides further that no preference or discrimination shall be taken as undue and unreasonable or unjust to a State unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission. It may happen that the conciliation and arbitration machinery in the agreement will not be the final machinery available to an aggrieved party of the resolution of any dispute. An aggrieved party would be in a position then to invoke the provisions of sections 102 and 104 of the Constitution if the dispute touches on the matters covered by these sections. However, and this is the key point, if the Inter-State Commission is not functional at the time the machinery in the agreement for resolution of disputes is exhausted&mdash;and we recall that the current Government has scrapped the Inter-State Commission&mdash;the party who is dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitration process may take the position that the decision is not enforceable as it has been deprived of pursuing the process set out in the Constitution for the resolution of such disputes. Clearly, scrapping the ISC in 1990 could create some problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to capital adequacy guarantees, article 5(3) of the articles of association provides that, during the establishment period, no shares in the capital of the Corporation other than 500 ordinary shares, 500 convertible shares and such of the A convertible shares as may be allotted to the Commonwealth or any State in return for cash or in satisfaction of the transfer of interests in assets, may be allotted without the unanimous resolution of the Corporation in general meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the Prime Minister's February statement, this is all right if everything goes according to plan, but the Corporation runs the risk of being deprived of capital during the establishment period if the initial projections prove incorrect and if the members are unable to unanimously agree on the basis of allotting new shares to raise the required capital. Obviously this could jeopardise the commercial viability of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is asset valuation. In an organisation run on a strictly commercial basis the assets to be taken over would have been valued at this stage so that the potential for disruption due to disagreements arising over the three-year transition period would be minimised. In the NRC's case, the valuation will be decided at the end. So the Minister is going to have to make a decision on that. I have touched on the best practice industrial agreements. Again, I think this is of critical importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is the power of any State to disagree with the corporate plan for political purposes. During the establishment period, any two members opposing any aspect of the corporate plan, regardless of the number of shares held by them, may frustrate the Corporation by denying approval to the corporate plan. After the establishment period the corporate plan may be approved by a special resolution of 75 per cent of the shareholders. This may mean that one State alone could frustrate the commerciality of the corporate plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there are a number of concerns about this. Whilst the coalition does see it as a positive step forward after nine years, we believe it is only a tentative start that has been delayed many times.

Perhaps we should ask, most of all: why did the Opposition tolerate the huge losses in the rail system for so many years without doing a thing about it? The Opposition thought that, because it all belonged to the States, it should leave it alone. It had no national plan and it had no national strategy in transport. None of today's governments tolerate the losses. They have begun to wipe out some of the unprofitable services at the expense of some criticism. When did these governments start facing the issues? After the election of the Hawke Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said we are only just starting to look at the issue. The Hawke Government, with Keating Budgets, and people who are prepared to do what other governments have failed to do, actually acted on the transport system and a wide range of other systems that desperately needed micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, politically, Australians have had three options: firstly, what the Liberals talk about&mdash;courageous, tough, ruthless decisions, reducing government and making the user pay; secondly, what the Liberals actually do, with the National Party blowing cold&mdash;collapse under pressure and leave off for another day; and, thirdly, what the Labor Party has done&mdash;considered, efficient, effective reforms blended with consideration for people. It is the same in transport as it is with the other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The Opposition is sceptical about our prospects. We do not dare to be sceptical. The Business Council of Australia predicted that two-thirds of achievable micro-economic reforms were in road and rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A working group of the Government working party directed me to convene a three-day search conference on land transport reform. Attention to the major issues discussed by that conference could benefit customers, providers and governments by $6 billion per year, at the same time as attending to important equity issues, community service obligations, rural needs and environmental health and safety demands. All three levels of government were represented at the conference, along with a wide range of industry, consumer and interest group representatives, as well as members of the working group. I am delighted to have a member of the working group here with me tonight, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). He has done a lot of work in land transport, both within the Government party and in parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trends that were identified by the conference could, I believe, shape the operating environment for road and rail to the year 2005. Some important discussions occurred and some important recommendations will be made to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Ministers later this month. It was certainly recognised that today's trends just cannot be accepted where we have ageing infrastructures in the rail system. These are infrastructures which call for more emphasis on infrastructure renewal. We have increased private sector infrastructure provision, which will give us some hopes, and a possibility of privatisation of aspects of rail, which will also give us some hopes. We see enormous unprecedented cooperation between the union movement and industry that has resulted in the attitude of consensus that has developed within the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be recognised that currently roads are taking over from rail in rural areas. It also has to be recognised that freight forwarding of products such as coal, iron ore and zinc on rail is of world standard in many cases. Containerisation links of intermodal transport which was begun in the 1980s is continuing. The National Rail Corporation is concerned with increased efficiency within interstate rail freight movement and the removal of artificial State barriers to freight movement. There is a potential for great change. The National Rail Corporation and the Federal Government have made it clear that we do not want to take over antiquated systems and antiquated practices&mdash;not just work practices, but also management practices&mdash;from the States. We have to have a completely new approach to rail transport in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the National Rail Corporation is not called the National Rail Freight Corporation, as was originally planned, because potentially there are great prospects for improvements in passenger transport as well as freight. I know that the Corporation needs to concentrate on freight now, but there are all sorts of prospects available, such as better bus and rail coordination. The unattractiveness of passenger journeys over three hours without sleepers may encourage a fast train comeback on routes such as Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne or Brisbane-Sydney-Canberra, or tilt trains over upgraded tracks, especially if there are incentives for private infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments have the major role in strategic planning if we are to achieve efficiency, social justice, fairness and sensitivity to conservation and safety. These are all essential. It really indicates the difference in approach between the Government and the Opposition in that we are saying that people are not items on shelves if they are working for employers&mdash;they are not to be solely considered as another cost or another commodity; they are people. This is the same with customers, as they are people; the same with people who live on rail and road corridors; and the same with people who travel and who require safety. All these are important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a trend to improved energy efficiency, and this may well give rail some prospects. I was sorry that I could not speak on the road legislation in the last session because some very important moves are being made on road as well. In no way do I want to denigrate the road system, nor do I predict any drop in clientele for the road system. It will increase. We have to work out where we can increase business most&mdash;in road or rail&mdash;and make sure that we get the right goods as well as people travelling on both road and rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are going to be more demands on transport, for both faster service and better quality. A just in time philosophy is developing. That is going to strengthen because it is cheaper to do it that way, and there will be changes in the attitude of freight users and a demand for total quality management. Higher speed rail will give rail more potential and it will give it the ability to compete. There is going to be more competition within rail and there is going to be more rail tourism. The last 20 years have seen inter-city rail decline by 11 million passengers to 87 million. That really is not good enough. We can develop it more; we can get it right. Passenger services will need to be more flexible and based more on demand; for example, the demand for services to and from work. They will need to meet the growing expectations of personal mobility, compete with air fares and give more attention to customer wishes. In no way can we predict that the car dominance that we have today will not continue. People are still going to want to travel in cars. What we need to do is make it as attractive as possible to use public transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are providing all this, costs will need to be transparent and the user will need to pay. The increased use of contracts for community services is likely so that where the Government pays the user is not bearing the burden of those contracts and those community services and savings are actually targeted where they belong. Congestion pricing is likely, and there may be pressure for increased fuel charges or for less expensive fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the key issues is one I have just mentioned&mdash;cost transparency. There are all sorts of costs that we do not consider. People accuse the Government of not spending all that is raised through the fuel excise on the actual provision of transport. We do not recognise that there are a whole lot of hidden costs: insurance, trauma, all the accidents that occur on our roads system, pollution, noise and accidents such as spillage of chemicals. The requirements for safety is another; for instance, pedestrian crossings and traffic lights. All this costs money which has to be put into the equation. By the time we do put it into the equation and we add up what all governments spend, there is not really very much difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes a farce of the Opposition's claim that under the GST it will wipe out fuel charges, put on a 15 per cent tax and make the user pay. How is the Opposition going to do it? Is it going to do it through registration charges? That is about all that is left. Is it going to do it through mass distance charges? We are obviously going to pay more if it does. If the users really pay, they pay for all those things. They pay for trauma, they pay for accidents, they pay for the safety measures, they pay for pollution. So let us get it straight from the Opposition as to what it means by proposing an actual reduction in costs of fuel and the user paying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The steps we need to take to achieve transparency are, first of all, to define the asset base. We actually have to define responsibilities between local and arterial roads and we have to define the national asset base for rail. That is extremely important so that we get the best value for money. Where government intervention is necessary for reasons of equity, access, social concerns and development, that intervention needs to be shown explicitly and not be included in user charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we really want something worth while in rail transport by the year 2005, we are going to have to start planning now. We need a national strategy now. We need to include land use planning and we need to provide direction for the transport system, merging with the other systems. For instance, housing and urban congestion issues all have to be taken into account. Then we will address the capacity problems that will develop in places like Sydney and Melbourne, and there will be price signals to users and operators. So we need a thorough strategic framework which will plan properly and that will involve commercial imperatives. We need that transport infrastructure to be in place to promote regional growth and the regional location of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there will be reduced regulation in the transport system and we are going to have a change in working conditions which may feature, for instance, three-shift options, enterprise agreements and more flexible hours for the people who work in the rail system. Rail is going to need to have a customer focus. The systems will have to respond to community demand for a better standard of living with a better standard of transport. Transport providers and governments will receive more feedback from customers and users and will be more attuned to their needs. Needs in local areas will be heeded more. Management will respond to travel demand in the major cities. Integration of the transport systems and a commercial base for their operation will suit customers better, as will a greater emphasis on production, including incentives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greater utilisation of capital equipment will mean more value added exports because we transport them better. It will mean more efficient and profitable transfer of commodities; it will mean efficient and profitable services to and from manufacturers and within their organisations. Fuel efficiency will be greater, to the benefit of users and consumers, and I believe that user education should assist in their acceptance and promotion of changes. We will then see rail accepted once again because it is good and it is effective in many ways. We will also meet those consumer demands I mentioned&mdash;environmental controls, safety, preventative health measures and a range of community service obligations, including in remote areas. They will be acceded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a government, if it decides that a service should be provided, must make up the difference between the efficient cost of providing the service and the fare which the customer pays; for instance, customer 50, government&mdash;Federal, State or local&mdash;20, which would reflect an efficient cost, and the authority running the system 30. We held in the conference that community service obligations must be transparent, that all levels of government should consult more on community service obligation policies and Government should consider diversion of responsibility for CSOs back into local communities. Representatives at the conference asked that the costs of environmental and safety measures be visible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are going to see some huge changes affecting road and rail. But the key issue for tonight is rail and there are some important strategies that can be taken to improve quality and service rationalisation. The objective has to be to provide high quality, competitive, reliable and efficient rail transport services and provide a level of customer service that is greater than that of rail competitors and that maximises economic efficiency. We need to have infrastructure and capital that is track related so that we have national standards&mdash;not all the differences we have from State to State at the moment. We need improved signalling and communications with advanced train control systems, not, as I saw in Melbourne just a year or so ago, signal systems that have rats crawling around eating them because they have not been upgraded. I understand that there has been quite a lot of improvement by the Victorian Government more recently. But we need to vastly improve our signalling and communication systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our terminals are vital. There may be a possibility with privatisation that some terminal areas will be owned privately. Further, we need to equate sidings with maximum train lengths, for instance. In the area of locomotives and rolling stock, we have to have national design standards. We need to have the capability for 4,000-horsepower locomotives and we need to reduce the average life of line haul locomotives to eight years. We need to have lighter tare wagons and to keep electrification options open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to upgrade our rolling stock to increase comfort and reliability in passenger rail. We have to provide for niche markets, as I said before. We have to look to the tourist industry and provide a five-star service with luxury interiors. We have to have high-speed bogies with proper suspension. We need rolling stock with larger dimensions; concurrently we need to have loading gauge and track improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, we have to have new technology systems right through the system. We have to have a seamless service and cost structures that are well defined so that we have a single, national, agreed way of determining costs, and improved capital utilisation. We have to have enterprise performance based awards and agreements so that we have a `safety net' base wage and conditions award, productivity related wage and conditions agreements, skills based classification structures with associated training modules, and national&mdash;not just State by State&mdash;accreditation for the skills that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to have rationalisation of rail businesses and yield management, so that rail actually sticks to the tasks it does best&mdash;for example, it would probably get out of less-than-container loads. Management resources need to be applied to the areas of maximum revenue. With respect to financial structures and access to capital, we need to improve the debt to equity ratio&mdash;to write off and convert where possible. We have to have private sector involvement to ensure that there is new equity. We have to have relaxation, perhaps, of Loan Council borrowing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, we need to have capital analysis. We need to have a national rail track network which equals the national road network in respect of benefit and cost analysis, including all external benefits. We probably will have privately owned tracks. For example, BHP can have its own trains and track which it may share with the rail system. So there are great prospects; this Bill is part of those great prospects. As I said, we can expect two-thirds of our possible micro-economic reforms in road and rail reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Before I focus on this question of private sector operators, I think it is worth reminding the House and the Australian people that the fact that the National Rail Corporation is not prepared to accept the responsibility for employees who might otherwise be transferred from the existing rail systems into the National Rail Corporation is illustrative of the fact that our industrial relations system in the railways has got to such a bad point that the National Rail Corporation simply is not prepared to accept those restrictive work practices and rorts. </PARA>

He is part of a government that has consistently refused to recognise that productivity arrangements are an inherent part of becoming internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill calls for the National Rail Corporation to be subject to all appropriate commercial constraints. It says that the Corporation has to pay taxes and rates and charges. It says that the Corporation will be left free to operate on a purely commercial basis.

It is selling 40 per cent of the Loy Yang B power station. It is attempting to sell another power station in Victoria. In Victoria there is talk about the Government selling off the Gas and Fuel Corporation. If the Victorian Government is selling all these assets that philosophically it would want to hang onto, how on earth will it be able contribute the investment funds necessary to upgrade the National Rail Corporation to make it truly productive?

The reason why Victoria has 11.6 per cent unemployment is that the Government in Victoria has created such a climate that no-one is investing. It cannot invest itself; it is selling its assets.

The reason I want to spend some time on that is that we all know by now that centralised economies simply do not work. We have watched the dissolution of those centralised economies in eastern Europe and in the old States of the Soviet Union. The reason that command economies do not work is that eventually people want to exercise their freedom of choice in speech, in religion and in the commercial marketplace.

I do not think that the honourable member for Throsby will be back here next time. The world has passed him by.

It happens to be used for the passage of trains. Trains go into a railway station, they stop, they disgorge, in this case, their freight or they pick up freight, and then they leave. There is no reason why railway stations cannot be used for other commercial activities. They are sometimes now used as car parks. There is no reason why they could not be used as retail centres or as educational facilities. A railway station can be used for a whole variety of other things.

We can franchise out other activities'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why the railway prime movers and freight carriages should not be either sold to the private sector or contracted out to the private sector, or why other transport companies should not have access to the railway lines. What is wrong with other transport companies bidding or tendering against the prime movers and the freight carriers of the National Rail Corporation for slots on the railway lines? As soon as some competition on those rail lines is introduced, guess what will happen? Prices will go down and service will go up. It is a characteristic of competition. The Government does not like this because it is lost in a 1940s time warp, but competition is what brings lower prices and better services to consumers. </PARA>

There is no reason why the whole question of the transport companies themselves should not be looked at. Eventually we will have to think about the overall ownership of the National Rail Corporation. One of the questions that might very well arise in the future is who should own the track. Nobody wants to see the track held in the hands of a private monopoly with monopoly rights being bestowed over the track. But, if there is a properly contestable market&mdash;in other words, if roads, ships and airlines can compete on equal bases with those railway lines&mdash;there is no reason for them to be in government hands. So, if we have a properly contestable market in that form of transport, it will be open for the owners of the National Rail Corporation to make a decision at that time on whether they, as governments, should be owning the National Rail Corporation tracks or whether someone else should be owning them. </PARA>

But what did those opposite do for the 30 years that they had control of the treasury bench? Absolutely nothing. But they stand up here and wax lyrical&mdash;`What have you people done in the last nine years?'. At least we have attacked the problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last few comments made by the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) I suppose could be forgiven given his wealth and the privileged background from which he comes.

So what the honourable member is saying will be introduced under this wonderful privatisation is happening now. Instead of theorising about these things, those opposite should actually go and see what is happening at the real workface of Australia. Then they would not come into this chamber and make some of the ridiculous and inaccurate statements that they make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is a straightforward piece of legislation that in essence has two purposes: to allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement and to establish the operating framework for the National Rail Corporation in so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. One of the greatest challenges facing this country, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) said, is to have an effective and an efficient transport system. The efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector are critically important to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of a national transport system, very much the result of the geography of Australia, nevertheless has serious repercussions on the economy of this country. This Bill represents a major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport affects almost every area of Australia's economic and social activity. As a significant intermediate cost, effective transport is vital to the competitiveness of the economy. Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many reports over the years have called for the reform of the Australian rail industry. I must say that I do believe that governments of all political persuasions, at both State and Federal level, have permitted our rail system to decline. Given the national importance of rail reform, it is appropriate that the Federal Government take the initiative in regard to rail reform. Rail is the cheapest, most effective, least polluting and safest method of transporting freight over long distances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing system to obtain its proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard. In the main this is due to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It has been widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst welcoming the measures contained in this Bill, I personally would have liked to have seen it go even further to include provision for urban public transport and export rail development. I feel that these areas require a lot more support from the Government and perhaps should be the subject of separate legislation. Above all, there is a need for the Commonwealth to be giving a lead for proper transport planning so that Australia by the end of the decade is working towards the integrated transport system it urgently needs, rather than tolerating a business as usual scenario with increasingly unacceptable external costs. The message is clear: unless our interstate rail links are properly upgraded, there will be more and more trucks on highways such as the Hume and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussion of rail matters, too often we find emphasis on deficits and poor management and work practices that for most systems belong to the 1980s. For example, the Industry Commission in its recent report on rail transport talked up a deficit of about $2,100m in 1988 to $4 billion, a figure much quoted by the shadow transport Minister, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I heard the honourable member for Bruce also trot out this figure. It is in their computer system; they just hit a button and it comes out. However, much of this $2,100m would have been in the form of community service obligations. The IC report could have taken a more positive attitude to rail transport and its potential to lower total transport costs for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the new NRC will overcome some of the problems of five different rail systems operating interstate freight trains, three different gauges and a multiplicity of unions and awards, there still remains the question of interstate passenger trains. I heard what the honourable member for Wannon said about the Indian Pacific. The Indian Pacific does lose a lot of money, but why should it? We have shown what we can do with the Ghan. Why should we not spend money and promote the Indian Pacific as an international luxury train?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, I travelled from Cape Town to Johannesburg on the famous South African Blue Train. That train was promoted around the world as a luxury train. The fare on that train was almost double the cost of an air fare. I have also travelled on the Indian Pacific, and the Indian Pacific&mdash;out of the date as it is&mdash;would leave that Blue Train in South Africa for dead. It is a much better train but we do not promote it. The South Africans promote the Blue Train around the world as a luxury train travelling from Cape Town to Johannesburg. One has to book for that train about four months in advance of travelling and it costs double the air fare. We could do exactly the same with the Indian Pacific. We could promote it as a luxury train and get people on that train. We have shown that we can do that when we spent money on upgrading the Ghan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst discussing things that remain to be done, the mainline interstate track in New South Wales, with steep grades, sharp curves and tight clearances, must also be remedied. For the efficient operation of freight trains with modern inter-modal capability&mdash;including double-stacked containers&mdash;good tracks with gentle grades, easy curves and good clearances are essential. The only interstate links in Australia meeting these requirements are the Adelaide-Perth and the Adelaide-Alice Springs lines. Coupled with good management on the part of Australian National and Westrail, rail has a high modal share of these corridors. The other corridors linking Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane need urgent upgrading to what is now called fast freight train&mdash;or FFT&mdash;standards. The Federal Government has recognised this in the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but the coalition does not seem to be able to realise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the problems on the existing north coast line are shown by State Rail calling for tenders for the replacement of an old wooden bridge at Craven&mdash;which is near Gloucester&mdash;with a concrete bridge on a curve that requires trains to slow down to about 70 kilometres an hour. This would not be tolerated on any road and should not be happening on the second most important interstate rail link in Australia in terms of tonnage moved. Instead, the State Rail Authority must rebuild on an improved 800 metre radius curve that will allow through running at 115 kilometres an hour. However, it seems that the Federal Government's recent package providing additional funds is too late to stop the bridge at Craven being rebuilt on a cheap and nasty alignment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the honourable member in a minute. I am concerned that the unions in Victoria or elsewhere might object to the National Rail Corporation's deciding to introduce contractors to improve efficiency in many areas of its operation. There will be a repeat of what occurred recently in the La Trobe Valley regarding overburden removal, incorrectly portrayed in the press as a win-win situation, when in fact the compromise really reasserted the dominance of the union officials in the Victorian Public Service policy making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who is at the table, ought to note that situation, because he would be familiar with his own friends and colleagues in the Victorian Trades Hall Council still handling those situations in a position of control when they should be in a position of cooperation to solve the problems in the La Trobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also question whether the Commonwealth will ensure that the urban sections of the Victorian Public Transport Corporation are made more efficient, as the Melbourne passenger operations alone lose half a billion dollars annually. It would not be good enough to merely focus on the country or interstate lines to improve their profitability. In the Melbourne suburbs, every rail commuter's single trip is subsidised in the amount of $2.50 by the taxpayer, but the State Government is still reluctant to introduce new technology, such as ticket machines, despite obvious benefits to the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation must ensure that its transit times are competitive with those achievable by road. This is a key feature. The building of a dedicated freight line from Campbelltown to Enfield in Sydney will help in avoiding the significant delays that freight services between Sydney and Melbourne presently face. Not only are superfreighters routinely delayed for an hour or more on the way to or from the Sydney yards, or on their way between Melbourne and Brisbane, but the existing signalling system is antiquated. However, I remain sceptical that all these railway infrastructure improvements can be met within the budget specified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be emphasised too highly that companies such as Brambles, TNT and Mayne Nickless require freight between adjacent capital cities to leave a rail terminal at 6 p.m. and arrive at the other end by 7 a.m. at the latest for delivery to customers, who are not wedded to using rail. It is essential that strict attention be paid to what the customers and the shipping companies sending containers want&mdash;that is, fast and reliable service. Dedicated freight services, such as superfreighters, are very important in creating the image the railways need in marketing their product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to see the volume of trucks on the Hume Highway grow by only 50 per cent instead of 100 per cent by the year 2000, the railways will need to lift their game. I think it is very important for the National Rail Corporation to bring about a stabilisation of these numbers on the Hume Highway. Just imagine a doubling of the number of trucks we now have on the Hume Highway. If this proposal of the National Rail Corporation can have some impact on these truck numbers, it will have done a good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation will now effectively have 70 per cent of its equity coming from the Commonwealth&mdash;the $296m injection over five years and the One Nation spending of a probably grossly underestimated $454m. The States must not undermine the National Rail Corporation for petty short term purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the NRC, Mr Ted Butcher, has given an impression that the route selected between Sydney and Adelaide will be via Melbourne rather than through Broken Hill, although I do not believe this will happen in under three years. If the State of New South Wales wants to keep open the Broken Hill line, it should be required to pay for its upkeep&mdash;not the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, the bankrupt Kirner Government has just received a report on the future of the broad gauge network from Booz-Allen, the same consultants who had done studies for the NRC. I have been supportive of the business community and various other authorities in Geelong that have endeavoured to find additional traffic that would have allowed the initial standardised route to Adelaide to go through North Shore and then either through Meredith or Cressy, instead of Ballan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the only possible new freight to Geelong is up to 600,000 tonnes of mineral sands from a CRA deposit at Laharum near Horsham and some softwoods from Albury. In CRA's case, I would be surprised if it did not use road transport for the first two years, given the projected initial production of only 300,000 tonnes per annum. The softwoods venture is some years down the track and is complicated by this Government's difficult-to-understand attitude towards our wealth producing timber industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Geelong's case for inclusion is hindered not only by additional cost but, more importantly, by the extra time a Geelong route would involve. Freight from Sydney, if it goes via Albury and not Broken Hill, would have to thread its way through Brooklyn and Newport, then down to North Shore and either up to Ballarat or across through Cressy. The extra time taken for freight from Sydney or Melbourne to Adelaide would be between half an hour and an hour for the Cressy or Meredith routes. This would reduce the attractiveness of rail against road and act as a rod for the back of the National Rail Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important feature for the freight lines is that there are now not too many sharp curves. Gradients themselves, such as that up the famed Ingliston bank between Bacchus Marsh and Ballan, are not such a problem, especially now that drawgear on wagons can be modified at less than $5,000 a vehicle to ensure that the stresses encountered going up hills can be coped with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that some in the Geelong area seem to have forgotten is that transport of grain from the Mildura and Swan Hill areas to Geelong will be affected if there is no broad gauge railway through central Ballarat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I travel by train on a monthly basis, which is more than the Minister does. The retention of one of these double tracks as broad gauge between North Ballarat junction, where the line goes north to Maryborough, and Warrenheip, where the line junctions to Geelong, should be the Geelong area's first priority. This would mean that grain coming from Maryborough and points north would still have access to Geelong and the maximum amount of interstate traffic could be attracted by virtue of the Ballan route, which is the quickest and most economical, being used for the Adelaide-bound freight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not my view that all rail lines in Victoria must remain open indefinitely. It is irresponsible of Victoria's Transport Minister, Mr Spyker, to state categorically that there will be no line closures. I believe it is inevitable that there will be some further rationalisation of grain lines in the Mallee. The days of having lines 15 miles apart are over. I note that the Victorian Government in its recent desperate so-called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priority Victoria</EMPHASIS> economic statement allocated only $50m for the conversion of broad gauge lines to the standard gauge. In the rather vague plan to accommodate future population growth that has surfaced over the past couple of days, the new map shows a standard gauge line from Melbourne to Geelong. The State Government to date has also spent over 80 per cent of its transport budget for the year, with only two-thirds of the year gone. How could it possibly be trusted to have done an accurate estimate of these costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the chief areas in which the NRC should distinguish itself is by encouraging the private operation of rail services. The concept of annual hire trains as currently practised could be extended. Why can we not have privately owned superfreighter trains crewed by TNT or Mayne Nickless contract drivers, with the company paying a fair rental for its use of facilities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States manages to retain a rail system that is privately owned, with the exception of Amtrak, the small passenger operation. Australia should be trying to emulate the performance levels of US railroads, not only in terms of tonnages carried per train but much more importantly in productivity levels. After all, the superfreighters introduced in the mid-1980s between the east coast capital cities and similar `westliner' trains between Adelaide and Perth have been quite successful, despite a poor reputation for reliability in some sectors such as Adelaide to Sydney at times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the drivers, station staff and even the gangers were rewarded by bonuses from, say, TNT for on-time operation, the rail systems would capture a greater share of the market. The truckies have an incentive to deliver freight on time, so why cannot the rail staff? The use of contract drivers would open up competition between employers for labour. Costs would decrease, which must benefit what I would have thought is a very price sensitive function&mdash;overnight express freight. Will the NRC exercise more care in its stewardship of assets?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standards of service also need dramatic upgrading. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 8 January, technology writer Graeme O'Neill gave an horrendous description of the troubles experienced by one V/Line freight customer in securing container wagons. That client was not identified, but I believe it to be Uncle Ben's, the pet food manufacturer. Every day, this company experiences wagon shortages; loading bound for the Port of Melbourne is delayed; and other non-budgeted expenses such as unplanned overtime payments to the company's staff result. Mr O'Neill notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This terse account hints at the enormous disruption to the company's activities caused by V/Line's ineptitude. . . . Its root cause . . . management and a succession of politicians who have failed spectacularly to bring the nation's ramshackle railway . . . system into the 20th century.</PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that the NRC operations be highly visible to Australian taxpayers. To lease back rolling stock, as the Victorian Government has secretly and shamefully done to US, Japanese and European financiers, is no solution to short term needs for funding. The Parliament must keep a close watch on the NRC so that these mistakes are not repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC must not dodge performance issues, as is done in Victoria. Unlike the electricity industry, indicators are not well developed, but the Victorian network is thought to have manning levels 50 per cent above some of those more progressive operations overseas. The Victorian transport corporation is certainly inflexible. Although revenue is well below budget, staff numbers have not been adjusted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the National Rail Corporation is successful. However, the poor track record of State governments in delivering industrial relations reform in their transport systems gives me little cause for great optimism in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991, I may appear to be digressing but I do so because nothing happens in isolation. This Bill is germane to other facets that must be addressed in Australia. I refer to the lack of an industry policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great problems we have in Australia is that no government in Australia has ever asked what sorts of industries this country needs. It is hard to establish a policy until we ask that question, but once we do, the answers leap out at us. Clearly, we need the great mining industries and the agricultural industries, but they alone are not enough: we have to downstream process and value add where we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must then ask ourselves what is strategic in Australia, what we would need if the world caught fire&mdash;not a lot. We would need transport, communications, surveillance and medicine. Railways fall very much into that area of transport. What do railways need?  Where do railways thrive? They thrive best on large flat areas with long distances. That is exactly what Australia has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had policies for many years which have worked against the national operation of railways. They have been working on an intrastate basis. This is being addressed in this Bill. I have heard a very pessimistic picture painted by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), who was talking about an obscure State in the extreme south-east corner of this country, when there are other parts of Australia where the picture is certainly not so gloomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Australian National has, for many years, run a business that operates at a profit for its freight carriage. Westrail is probably the most efficient railway system in Australia and I would expect it to be returning hefty&mdash;one might even say obscene&mdash;profits, very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, on an east-west basis, Australia is fairly well served by its railways; it is on a north-south basis that the problem arises. We must ask ourselves: why is this so? It is basically because governments of all persuasions have ignored the need for rail infrastructure for probably 50 years. The railways have been working and running down their capital stock. They have been unable to keep pace with development  and we now have a lamentable situation where our roads are clogged with trucks which do damage beyond the amounts that they pay for in fuel tax and hidden costs to the consumer. Our railways are in a state of disrepair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to overcome some of those problems. I certainly wish the National Rail Authority every success. However, I must warn the Authority that I shall be watching closely to see that it does not jeopardise the efficiencies we have achieved on the east-west line to try to make up for the losses we experienced on the north-south line. I think that would be a backward step. I will be keen to see that there are no unnecessary freight increases on the east-west line to try to subsidise the inefficiencies on the north-south line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had an industry policy in Australia which said that transport was of prime concern, we would have probably had a manufacturer of railway engines and rolling stock; not a dozen or half a dozen manufacturers, probably only one. That manufacturer would have been at the forefront of design in locomotives and Australia would have been a nation that produced the very best in rolling stock. This has not been so. We have tended to opt for buying overseas equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not surprising when we hear the honourable member for Corangamite suggesting that we should go and look at how the Americans do it. In reality, Australian railways are probably the most efficient in the world. Certainly, Hamersley Iron's railway system in the Pilbara would be world-class in its operation, in its efficiency, in the tonnages moved and in the costs per tonne mile. By any standard, Hamersley runs and operates a very effective railway system using the latest technology. We should perhaps look to these companies and not to overseas companies. This is a continuation of a cultural cringe that has affected Australia for far too long and far too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I wish to say something about passenger services because they are an integral part of what trains should provide. We know that all the railways of Australia&mdash;even given its success, Westrail has really been no exception&mdash;have tended to try to get out of passenger services. The Transtrain from Adelaide to Perth and the Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth are two of the great train journeys of the world. I believe that these services have gone downhill in the past 20 years&mdash;not in the rolling stock; the facilities on these particular train journeys are better than those available on other great train journeys in the world. The South African Blue Train was mentioned, but I think it is also true that the facilities are better than those that exist on the Orient Express. There has been no ethos for passenger services and they have been allowed to run down and fall into disrepair. They need to be completely revamped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great train journey across the Nullarbor is something that we can market overseas. We should have been actively seeking to get Germans, Japanese, Americans&mdash;people from all over the world&mdash;to come and make this epic journey by train. We should have provided them with the very best services and we should have hiked the cost accordingly. At the moment the service is far too cheap. For many years the railways have had an archaic booking system. Even when a person cannot get a seat on the train, the train is half empty, and half of those passengers are travelling courtesy of railway pensions or some other means which gave them a very cheap service. No wonder the service was running at an enormous loss.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But look at the potential in terms of foreign dollars earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little initiative by the national tourist organisations to promote this passenger service overseas could gain valuable foreign currency. I imagine the service would provide a very efficient airline-style booking service. People could get off the train at, say, Cook, where they could be met by organised tours which would take them down to the head of the Bight and show them the romping grounds of the humpback whale and the last stronghold of the hairy-nosed wombat. They could be taken along the highway, across the Nullarbor again at, say, Cocklebiddy, to get on the train again at Rawlinna. They would have transversed part of Australia seen by very few people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, if such a service were done properly, it could be well and truly charged for. It would also have some other benefits. It would be far preferable to the crazy notion being put forward by the South Australian Government for World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor Plain. The only motive the South Australian Government has that I can see is to garner a few grubby votes in Adelaide. It is intent on pushing this heritage listing when it would be much better if the Nullarbor Plain were treated more understandingly by organised tours. The last thing the Nullarbor Plain needs is hordes of people traipsing across it because it is a World Heritage listed area. Not only would it be ecologically bad for the area, it would also be very dangerous, because the Nullarbor Plain probably claims more lives in terms of people who get stranded and die of thirst than any other area in Australia. Having been personally involved in several of these searches for people, I am aware of what conditions are like out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to introduce these services, I think we would see an immediate turnaround in productivity and return on that railway system. I do not believe the system needs new equipment&mdash;it certainly needs refurbishment&mdash;but it would need a change of ethos. I am not sure that the National Rail Corporation has the capacity for that change of ethos because it is, in my view, rigidly geared to the carriage only of freight. I think freight is very important, but I do not think we should forget to look at the great foreign currency earning potential of passenger services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to hear the honourable member for Corangamite saying that many lines in Victoria hauling grain will be closed down. I am sure that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) will be interested to hear exactly what lines are to be closed. If it is the policy of the National Rail Corporation, it should say which lines are to be closed down so that farmers are in a position to make their plans well in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that the honourable member for Corangamite is on very good terms with Sir Peter Abeles. He gave him many plugs in his speech and he seems to think that TNT or Mayne Nickless is the answer to our problems. I believe that there is a place for these people in a national rail system, but I do not believe there is any evidence that they would run it better. I do not see that there is any need at this stage to have them more involved than they are already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that is not taken into account in Australia is that railways have to pay for all their infrastructure, which is not true of road transport. I am aware that the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport in Western Australia found that an average 8-wheel truck caused $30,000 more damage to roads than it paid for in fuel excise. That is a chastening figure, because it really means that there is a hidden cost paid for by the general public and not seen in the operation of these road services. I am told that it requires 19 tankers a day to supply fuel to Canberra. This seems to be potentially dangerous. It would be far better if this sort of freight were carried by rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must, however, spend the money on infrastructure. I believe that it is a government responsibility not to load infrastructure costs onto railways. It is in the national interest to have a system of rail transport in Australia that gives us a viable alternative and helps to get these heavy transports off the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In digressing, I might say that an initiative such as this would do far more for genuine road safety than does the application of multinova cameras, which seem to proliferate everywhere in Victoria. It seems to me that these things have long ceased to have anything to do with road safety and are now just a money making device. It is, of course, not limited just to Victoria. If we are genuine about road safety, we will be seeking to get a lot of this heavy transport off our roads and onto the rail; rail can handle it much more safely and move cargoes expeditiously if it is operated correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute to Westrail. In particular, I want to pay tribute to the previous Minister for Transport in Western Australia, Julian Grill. It was he, as Minister&mdash;while he had at that time a very effective commissioner&mdash;who gained the very big productivity increases. He addressed the problem and he was able to reduce the number of people employed by Westrail by over 2,500, without a strike. It was all done by attrition, natural wastage, and by selective redundancies. It was done with no fuss and it was done with support of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say that because there has been a view that unions are intransigent and that they must be stamped on because one cannot get cooperation from them. This clearly is not true. I cite the maritime unions as a case of this. I think the maritime unions have been very cooperative and, in fact, quite far-sighted in their desire to make their particular industry competitive. There is no reason why that attitude should not prevail throughout Australia. I think there is a particular problem in Victoria. But, if it had had the leadership that was displayed in Western Australia, I believe it could have been achieved there, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the process has gone as far as it should in Westrail. But the proof of the pudding is in the efficient way in which that service runs and the profits that I would expect it to be generating. It has been an interesting exercise there because Westrail now has a commissioner who comes out of the Main Roads Department. He was a Main Roads engineer and he has seen both sides of the fence. I think he has brought a cross-fertilisation to railway thinking that has been very useful. I think Dr Gill has done very well with Westrail, and I hope that he can continue to do this very important work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the effect on the rural community, we must take into consideration that some lines simply cannot make a profit, but there are social reasons why they should be kept open. If this is the case, such burdens should not devolve on the railways; they should be funded from the public purse. I think it is highly reasonable and highly responsible that situations such as this are considered. I am not saying that carte blanche should be given in every situation. But there are situations where this should clearly be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard one previous honourable member talking about the railway from Port Augusta to Broken Hill. This railway is a national asset and it must not be allowed to decay. I think it would be absolutely bizarre of the Australian National Rail Corporation to decide to move all of its freight via Melbourne; if it has train loads that can be consigned directly to the west, they should clearly go on the more direct route through Broken Hill. So there is a good reason for keeping that rail service. In any case, in my view, it is always advisable to have an alternative. I believe that the gauging problems on the Broken Hill route to Sydney can be more ably and easily handled than they can be on the outdated Melbourne-Sydney line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been talk in Australia of a very fast train. I do not think there is need in Australia for a very fast train at the moment. What we need is a moderately fast freight service, and I believe that the National Rail Corporation has the ability to provide Australia with that, which could add significantly to our prosperity and our productivity. I believe that it should be continually encouraged to do so by government action and government ethos. But it is not going to happen overnight, and there will have to be an ongoing commitment to infrastructure. I might add that I am one of those who believe that the allocations made in the One Nation statement are simply not enough. I believe that we are going to have to spend more money on rail if we are to have the rail services that this country needs and which are desirable in this country not only for the efficiency of our industries but also to provide a better quality of life to many people in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When pastoralists were encouraged by the government of the day to go out and open up areas of the Nullarbor Plain, which is extremely good pastoral country, the area was sold because of the excellent access provided by Commonwealth Railways, as it was then. This is true; the service was excellent. One of my objections to the operations of Australian National is that, in latter days, its push has been to carry through freight, and it has sadly neglected the responsibility that it has to people in those areas. But it is worse than that because this throws people back on the need to use roads. Along the Nullarbor the roads are appallingly bad; there is limestone outcropping everywhere. It is very hard to grade good roads, and transport has become an enormous problem. This is so much so that pastoralists cannot get bulk fuel delivered to some parts because of the state of the road. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The railway maintains that it has no need for the road and, therefore, it does not pay anything for its upkeep. But the reality is that the railway is one of the main users of the roads. I have actually written to the Minister saying that he should take up with the National Rail Corporation its responsibility to put some of its funding into those roads  It is quite possible that in future we will have a derailment out there involving a passenger train and, being an emergency, we would have to get quick access to it. At the moment, that road is simply not good enough. It needs to be upgraded, and I believe that the railways should be compelled to accept some of that responsibility. They have the equipment. That responsibility may even be in the order of providing equipment for the maintenance of that road. It is a need that is urgent and it is one which should be addressed. </PARA>

It wants bulk loads&mdash;be they containerised packages or the types of commodities that come from our rural and industrial areas or our mining areas, such as iron ore, coal and those sorts of things. In fact, I mention our rural areas and I wish to address some of my speech to the problems associated with shifting some of our rural production which rail seems to fight State to State to hang on to. This Parliament took some steps to attempt to change the situation and to introduce some competition. I refer, of course, to the freighting of wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is forgotten in all of this is that unless we have substantial loading, we have not got a proposition in rail. Very heavy emphasis is put on featherbedding, overstaffing and the rorts and rackets that we know have grown up over the decades, almost for centuries, in our government operated rail systems. It is a simple fact in Australia that if we got down to one person working in the rail system, most of it would still be inefficient. This Parliament has heard me on this particular issue before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting publication, a year book on the railway system, has been brought to my attention. I would draw it to the attention of some people and invite them to read it because it is written by the railway people, and consequently I do not think it tells any fibs. It is interesting to read that V/Line claims to have freight revenue of $158.9m and operating expenditure of $1.52 billion. One would wonder how many business operators could answer that. That is in its book. Of course, it talks about government grants of $167.2m and recurrent $800.2m. I do not know what that is, but the two figures that catch my eye are those for freight revenue and operating expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Victoria has the worst system, and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has just been telling us how Western Australia has probably the best. He mentioned his good mate Julian Grill. When I was elected to this House the Court Government was in office in Western Australia, and I had to go out into my electorate and start to support the efforts of one Cyril Rushton, the then Minister for Railways, who decided to take from the Western Australian railway system its so-called smalls traffic&mdash;all the little parcels and matchboxes and whatever else a railway system is most inefficient in moving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who gets the credit for the consequent reduction in staff and the improved efficiency, but that fundamental decision, which was not liked by the unions or the farmers but which was patently correct, was taken by the Liberal Government. It is an historical fact, and it is recorded in this book, that every time Westrail stopped doing something&mdash;and wisely so&mdash;it made more money, because it was carrying freight that was totally uneconomic. There is a message for this new Corporation that if it gets into the business of competing with trucks just for the sake of competition, it will lose a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, therefore, to look at some statistics which I often quote to my farmers and try to quote to the Wheat Board. I get a little fed up in my electorate when I see  off-rail bins where there is no rail facility, and I find time and time again that the price of freighting that wheat to the nearest point on a tonne per kilometre basis is about 20 per cent lower than it is from the next equivalent rail siding. There are towns in Western Australia called Broomehill and Kojonup. Kojonup is some 30 miles further away from the port of Albany than is Broomehill. Kojonup has no railway line, and at my last check the growers were paying about $8.60 a tonne to have their wheat freighted to Albany. Down at Broomehill, where the railway service was available, it was $11.60 a tonne&mdash;and it is 30 miles closer to the port. It is an even more interesting story than that, because the railways got a little bit embarrassed about this situation, so they bought out the road contractor and they now road freight the wheat only to Broomehill, where they re-silo it&mdash;another handling process&mdash;and then rail freight it down, but still at $8.60 a tonne because that is the contracted price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers are not altogether dills. They know that for $3 a tonne they can drive their wheat past Broomehill up to Kojonup. What we have consequently is truckloads of wheat going from Kojonup to Broomehill, and the farmers carting it in the opposite direction back to Kojonup. It sounds a bit silly to me, but it is the sort of thing that goes on from time to time. It is a situation that I think needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental issue in my electorate is that we are carting 1,200 tonnes of wheat per kilometre of rail track. That is practically the only loading that goes on the rural rail system in Western Australia. I checked the figure for New South Wales, where in the rural areas it is about 2,000 tonnes. We have another rail system which is very efficient and stands as an example to this new Corporation, if it really wants to know how to get into the business of running a railway line. I refer to the system that operates in the iron ore province of the Pilbara, where 80,000 tonnes of iron ore per kilometre of rail track is shifted, compared with the 1,400 tonnes per kilometre shifted in my electorate. The point I want to repeat is that with those sorts of loadings no-one can make money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is even worse when we realise that it would not matter where those little railway lines run to&mdash;some of them are now so decrepit that the trains can only do 15 to 20 kilometres per hour&mdash;a bitumen road runs alongside them. While we have motorists, people who drive motor cars, we will continue to have that situation. We have this constant debate about who should pay for the roads, and it is always focused on road damage. What about road infrastructure?  For whom do we build roads?  I do not think we have ever built one for a truck. We politicians build them for all those thousands of voting motorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie who mentioned the royal commission into freight handling or grain, or something, and said that it worked out a figure on how trucks damage roads. How in the hell it did that, I do not know. I do not know how anyone can calculate the damage that a truck does to a road, if it is used by trucks, and how often it is used by trucks. Do we have roads that only trucks use?  It is a stupid assessment because nobody can do it. We can get a computer and do all sorts of things, but we have to start with some basic premise. Get that royal commission back and ask it what are the economics of sealing a suburban road, the one that leads up to the family home. We do not even seal it for the use of the motor car; we do it to keep the dust down. But we keep being told that in the transport system, the truck, frequently the most efficient option, has to pay for it all. In the end, of course, it is the consumers who pay because truck operators like to make a small profit, and they are paying something like 30 per cent of their revenue in one tax or another. The question is where should we be using a railway line and what should we be putting on it. I mentioned Mr Cyril Rushton, the then Minister, cutting out all these small services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a town in my electorate that has two shops and a couple of other things. It is a very small town called Cranbrook. It was getting a train a day. When the small service was cut out, it got a truck a day. After a couple of weeks the truck driver said, `I cannot make a living delivering to Cranbrook every day. I want to do it once a week'. That is all that the economics demanded, yet under the old system we ran a train a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kalgoorlie also mentioned the social cost. There is sometimes no need to dwell on these problems. People started to complain that they could not get their mail. They rang me up and I asked who delivered their bread. They said, `Oh, a baker from Albany'. I said, `Fine, then get the baker from Albany to bring the mail'. And he did. In fact, he got a dollar a bag and he said it was good; it was paying for his petrol. That is what we are about in this place; we are about sensible decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am here primarily to warn the Government that implementing this proposal is not as easy as it looks and it should not have got into it. I was a bit interested, too, to hear the honourable member for Kalgoorlie lauding the praises of one Julian Grill. Of course we have the Midland Workshops in Western Australia, which is where all the work is done on the railway rolling stock. It has a longstanding reputation of inefficiency. The present commissioner, whom the honourable member for Kalgoorlie quite properly congratulated and lauded, claims that if he could close it down he could save $45m. But there are too many votes out there for the present Labor Party so the poor old commissioner cannot take the proper commercial decisions which we are told will always be taken here. I bet they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that Mr Grill liked the workshops, but we also had a redundant abattoir out there. It covered about 65 acres, and adjoined a major regional centre&mdash;Midland. It had a big set of stockyards on it, which are still being used in a stock selling operation at this moment although they will not be for much longer. It is the major stock selling operation for all of Western Australia. Julian sold it for $450,000 to one of his mates. The royal commission into WA Inc. has had a bit to say about that. I do not know how much Julian made for us on the railways, but he has a lot to catch up on for letting 65 acres of beautiful land go. The fellow just went into the abattoirs and sold all the machinery that was in there and got his money back. He got the 65 acres for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of problems we have when we give business operations to government. That is fundamental to what I am saying. First, no-one runs railway lines unless they can be efficient, unless the freight task is there. But I admit that should be the case on the capital city runs provided this group does not just want to go around picking up all sorts of things. A company called Railex does that; it actually has a semitrailer that it turns into a train. It is not as smart as it looks. People cannot go more than about five or 10 miles from the railway station with these trailers because they have to be made so strong, to operate as a carriage, that of course some tonnes of actual cargo capacity is lost when they get onto the road because of axle loading restrictions. It is not as good an idea as it looks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Then we have to look at a couple of other aspects of this problem. We have a gauge problem with the railway lines. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his One Nation statement is throwing a big heap of money at that so we will have a standard 4 foot 8 inch gauge line around Australia. It is probably quite a good idea. But then we have a thing called clearance gauge, which we do not hear too many people talk about. A clearance gauge, of course, involves the tunnels, bridges and other things which people must operate with. Unless we can lift this standard gauge rail network to handle double stacking of containers, for instance, if we want to get it really efficient, we have not got much hope of making it a real operation. I do not think people have yet costed the clearance gauge costs between Sydney and Perth, for instance, to cope with a double stack&mdash;which would, of course, create huge revenues, particularly if we used the two ports of Fremantle and Sydney for an interstate operation, and turned the ships around and used the rail system. The rail then has to be very efficient. But these are the sorts of problems that have yet to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> More than anything, I have to express my concern that we have gone this far, we have put this thing together in legislation, we have committed hundreds of millions of dollars, but do not have the industrial relations system worked out. I do not think we will work it out. I think there are just too many unions within States. So it is a real problem, and it is one that the Government has to look at very closely because that is where I argue that this thing has its principal problem. Its principal problem is that it is going to be another government enterprise. There is always going to be someone answering to a Minister. Ministers do not always take commercial decisions. I just gave the House an example of that. The simple fact is that we should have been amalgamating this thing, we should have been buying out the States that have profitable railway organisations. We should have been going to some of our major superannuation funds, for instance, and saying, `You should become the owners of this railway infrastructure. You should run it like a road, and you should hire it to anybody who wants to use it'. Okay, that is a task; we have to work it out so that people take off when we tell them. There are considerations of that nature, but that is what computers and other things are for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is, first, we could have relieved the Australian taxpayer of substantial costs in this regard&mdash;capital cost and capital investment. We could have split the operation of the rail network away from the business of running trains. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) was critical of TNT, Mayne Nickless and other companies. I am sure that when he mentioned them he was giving them only as an example. But let the experts run the business. There is no difference between putting a train on a railway line and a truck on a road, basically. Let them be in the business. Brambles, a well-known company, is one of the biggest owners of railway rolling stock in the world. It owns it all in Europe and leases it out like pallets, and it works. That is the way people get business. Everyone wants all this superannuation money in, and they do not really know how they are going to invest it. AMP is rushing off buying insurance companies in London. They are the people who should be investing. There is a real opportunity to put Australia's savings into a railway line. But we should see whether they will buy any of the country ones which State governments continue to run. Of course they will not buy them, because they are not viable. Try to get Mount Newman or Hamersley Iron, the people who know all about running trains, to buy most of the rural railway network of Australia. They would not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In closing, Mr Deputy Speaker, my warning to the Government is this: do not do our money again, and do not do it by interfering. The Government still has the chance; it should put the network together and then sell it as a railway line and as rolling stock in two separate operations, and encourage as many people as practicable to operate the old rolling stock so there is genuine competition on the railway. Do not have rail competing with road; have rail competing with rail. Then the Government will know what the real price is and it might create some jobs for people in the railway system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very wide ranging debate this evening and I pay tribute to some of my colleagues on this side of the House in particular who have raised the question of passenger trains. I think it is very significant indeed that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who probably travels the world more than the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), raised quite significantly the problem of our not promoting some of the tremendous passenger trains that we have in Australia, vis-a-vis the Trans Australian or the Indian Pacific. I take note of what he said about how the South Africans sell the Blue Train which, by comparison, comes nowhere near the great trains that we have in Australia. Yet we have problems getting passengers on board our trains simply because we fail to sell the tourism aspect. I think that is quite tragic because I take great pride in the superb refurbishing work done on these passenger trains which takes place in my electorate at Port Augusta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the problems within the railway system. One cannot argue about that, particularly the difficulties with demarcation disputes and the unnecessary changing of crews. When we take the Indian Pacific across, the crew can take it only to Kalgoorlie and that crew has to be changed to take it the short distance into Perth. This has been quite a joke and is very ludicrous indeed. I could go on perhaps for the whole of the 20 minutes which I am allocated to speak on the problems within the railway system. But I do take some pride in the fact that I was a member of the former Joint Standing Committee on Transport and Communications that unanimously decided that we needed a national rail system. We worked out that there are five systems but only one solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that the Government did not take on all of our recommendations because we recommended that the new National Freight Corporation should be run by Australian National, which is the significant, successful railway system within Australia. There is no doubt about it, VicRail in Victoria and State Rail in New South Wales have been a disaster. One wonders why some of the people who are on the board of the new National Freight Corporation are there. I note that a Max Moore-Wilton is on the board. I guess the only thing I can say about this gentleman is that he was a disaster when he ran the maritime industry in Australia, so he cannot do any worse being a board member of the National Freight Corporation. However, I guess this is balanced by the fact that we have on the board a former very successful State Minister for Transport in South Australia, Gavin Keneally, who was an excellent Minister in South Australia. We also have Laurie Carmichael of the ACTU, who has been one of the really positive people within the ACTU with economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that this new system does operate, but, as I say, I signal my disappointment that the National Rail Corporation is not to be managed by the successful railway system, AN. However, this Bill involves significant restructuring of rail institutions, technology, management and work practices. Without such initiatives, we would be unable to meet the community's current needs let alone its future needs. It is important transport reform. Transport affects almost every area of Australia's economic and social activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a significant, intermediate cost, efficient transport is vital to the competitiveness of the economy. Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains. This is highlighted by a number of major studies in recent years which have exposed the deficiencies in our transport system and the potential gains from reform. In 1989-90, the Industry Commission estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, could alone realise an additional $6 billion in gross domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributable to rail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in its October 1991 report on rail transport, the Industry Commission confirmed the importance of reforming the rail industry. Australia cannot afford to ignore such gains, particularly given their potential for contributing to economic growth and our standard of living. One of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard. This is due in the main to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement, and reliability needs to be greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail. One of my colleagues&mdash;I think it was the honourable member for Throsby&mdash;mentioned earlier tonight the significant role that the maritime unions played in changing their work practices. I have said on a number of occasions in this place that Pat Geraghty of the Seamen's Union is responsible for some major reforms in the maritime industry. I certainly hope that the rail unions seize the initiative that some of the other transport unions have taken on board and follow the lead of some of these other unions&mdash;whether it be the maritime unions or the waterside workers&mdash;with the changes that have taken place in their work practices, because if this system is going to be successful, we will need the full co-operation of the trade union movement. It is very important indeed that these unions put behind them demarcation disputes and work very closely together trying to make this system a very successful one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Railway workers can have a very bright future indeed if they are prepared to see the positive aspects of the National Rail Corporation. Indeed, I am very hopeful that the large amount of money, $2 1/2m, that is being spent on upgrading the railway workshops at Port Augusta, will put them at the top of technology and that they will play a significant part in the maintenance of the railway infrastructure, which is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, I think industry has said that it would make greater use of rail if a reliable, quality service were provided. I think that this was one of the major matters raised with the Joint Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, of which I was a member. One of the problems brought to us on numerous occasions was the lack of delivery of freight. It was put to us, importantly, that if freight could be delivered on time more people would use rail. But if people cannot be sure when goods sent by rail will be delivered, naturally they are going to bypass rail, even if it is more expensive to have goods carried by truck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some types of traffic where rail beats the competitiveness of the trucking industry hands down. The most obvious example of this is the carrying of freight over long distances. Nobody can compare with rail over long distances. If rail undertakes the task to which it is best suited and is efficient, it can carry goods at a lower cost to the community than road transport. There will be savings in terms of accidents, air and noise pollution and energy costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it must be made clear that there is no hidden agenda by the Government to favour rail over road. Some 80 per cent of freight is moved fewer than 100 kilometres from its origin. The rail industry cannot service this market, and trucking will remain the most efficient way of handling this freight distribution. What the Government is about is an efficient land transport sector within which both the road and rail sectors can develop and grow together. It is estimated that the volume of freight will double by the end of this decade. There is plenty of room for road and rail to prosper. An efficient, commercially competitive and self-sufficient interstate rail freight operator is therefore no threat to the road transport industry&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;because such a situation will remove what is today an inefficient competitor that retains its place in the market only because of publicly funded subsidies. That is not fair and this Government is doing something positive to improve the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the Federal Government has positively promoted the revitalisation of the interstate rail freight system. This is part of a broader set of transport industry objectives within which each of the transport modes can undertake the task to which it is best suited. To repeat, it is not a matter of favouring one mode over another. What the Government is striving for is an integrated transport system that will provide the community with an efficient and competitive land transport system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation will operate on a strictly commercial basis with a financially viable corporate plan and be subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Corporation will have access, by ownership or other appropriate arrangements, to the assets, including track infrastructure, necessary to achieve commercial viability. It will operate under a labour arrangement incorporating an enterprise award which reflects best practice and productivity standards through efficient work and manning practices determined by the technical capacity of its equipment and commercial considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation will have the capacity to contract out activities where that is the most efficient approach. It will provide access on a commercial basis to the NRC network and to terminal facilities for private and public sector operators. It will have the capacity to provide services to government with the charging for such services being on a strictly commercial basis. It will not be responsible, financially or in any other way, for redundancies that may arise in rail authorities, resulting from its formation and transfer of functions and assets to it. It will be subject to all rates, taxes and charges and will not have the shield of the Crown. It will be treated as an ordinary incorporated company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that some of these things were of deep concern to members of the Opposition, but I hope that allays some of the problems they have with this legislation. The establishment of the National Rail Corporation is intended to ensure that interstate rail freight movements operate without government subsidies. The National Rail Corporation will operate under the provisions of the Companies Code as a strictly commercial corporation at arm's length from government. Directors will be required to act according to the provisions of the Companies Code in the interests of all shareholders. The National Rail Corporation will also be subject to the laws of the Commonwealth and relevant States on the same basis as any other private company. Likewise, it will be subject to the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many of my colleagues on this side of the House have said, the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill represents another major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy. This is a unique system which has come into Australia. I am only disappointed, as I said earlier, that the National Rail Corporation is not controlled by Australian National, which has been very successful. One can only monitor the situation and hope that the goodwill that prevails in this House bears fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any new rail projects considered to be commercially justified by the National Rail Corporation will need to meet the usual requirements of State and Federal legislation, including legislation relating to environmental aspects. The Corporation must have a strong customer orientation and provide services that meet the needs of existing rail customers, and that will attract business from new customers. It has to provide efficient and, above all else, reliable freight services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation is uniquely placed to do this. For the first time in Australia's history it will be the sole operator of a national interstate rail freight network. It will control marketing and service delivery, which will allow it to operate a seamless service. Control over the total network will allow the National Rail Corporation to benefit from synergies that the current fragmented operators cannot achieve. This control will also enable improved utilisation of the rail infrastructure and rolling stock. Equally it will allow better utilisation of human resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Rail Corporation was incorporated in September and directors were appointed to the board. I have said something which was probably a bit rough on one of the members of the board. I think that, basically, the board has a strong commercial flavour with a good balance of skill. I certainly hope that Mr Butcher, the chairman, whom many people on this side of the House have had doubts about, is better than many of us think he may be. I do not say that too ungenerously because there has been a lot of comment about him. Mr Butcher will chair this board. He has an extensive commercial career in transport and is a former president of the Inter-State Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members of the board are Messrs Young, Strong and Morgan, who are from the private sector and will contribute the benefit of their broad commercial skills and experience. Apart from Max Moore-Wilton, whom I mentioned earlier&mdash;and I do not retract a sentence from that&mdash;we have Mr Wright; as I said earlier, Mr Gavin Keneally, who will be excellent; and Mr Laurie Carmichael, who will contribute his comprehensive industrial relations expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board is recruiting a management team which will negotiate an enterprise award with the unions and develop a corporate plan, including an investment strategy. These must be completed prior to the injection of capital funds by the shareholders. It is expected that the NRC will start rail freight operations in early 1992, beginning with marketing and terminal operations. The necessary functions will be transferred progressively from other rail systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even allowing for continued cooperation at all levels, it may take three years for functions to be handed to the new Corporation and five years for the whole process to be completed. I certainly hope that, in that time, which seems to me to be quite lengthy, all the problems can be ironed out of the new system and it can be a real goer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRC has been set the task of breaking even within three years and to be self-supporting within five years. Under the agreement the Corporation and current systems will agree on a schedule for the transfer of assets during the establishment period. Wherever possible, operations that incur losses will be turned around before the hand over. There will be a strong incentive for current operators to improve the performance of loss making activities before hand over to the NRC as current systems will be required to pay compensation to the Corporation if the costs of carrying out a transferred operation exceeds the costs based on best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the financial and voting arrangements. Within the provisions of the Companies Code the NRC will receive equity contributions of some $415m over five years. These will come from the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The equity contribution of each shareholder set out in the agreement is: the Commonwealth, $296m; New South Wales, $76m; Victoria, $35m;  and Western Australia, $8m. I think Victoria and New South Wales got out very cheaply indeed and got off very lightly, given how poorly they run railway systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his recent statement on the economy and employment, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced, amongst other things, that the Federal Government would be prepared to provide a further $20m to accelerate priority capital upgrading of the rail network in New South Wales and Victoria. That is very good of them. The Commonwealth is seeking the agreement of shareholders that these additional funds will be recognised as part of the Commonwealth's equity contribution. Provision exists for other governments to participate at a later date, should they wish. Additional calls on equity during the first three years will be met according to the schedule of long term equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have run out of time. I certainly hope that the National Rail Corporation is successful. As I say, I am terribly disappointed that Australian National is not running this system. I wish we had done more to argue the case for AN to run the system. In that way I would be absolutely dead confident that the system would be very successful. I only hope that New South Wales and Victoria can lift their game and that the National Rail Corporation is as successful as we on this side of the House hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the adjournment tonight to bring to the notice of this House a problem in my electorate dealing with legionnaire's disease. The fourth death resulting from the outbreak of legionnaire's disease in Sydney's south-west occurred on Sunday night. The victim was one of my constituents and was the second Fairfield resident to die from the disease in less than a fortnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now 22 confirmed cases of legionnaire's disease and 35 possible cases who are all being treated in south-western Sydney hospitals. Nine of these people are in intensive care. People are still being admitted to hospital suffering from the disease, with another six being hospitalised on the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Authorities from the New South Wales Health Department have announced that there may be more than one source of contamination by the bacteria and it has narrowed the source area down, as I understand it, to two blocks within the Fairfield shopping centre. Air-conditioning systems all over Fairfield are being checked and tested for the legionnella bacteria. Even my electorate office was checked and then rechecked today before it was given the okay by health authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Health Department and council officers have been working around the clock checking air-conditioning systems since the outbreak of the disease was discovered publicly last Thursday, I believe the action has come too late. If the air-conditioning systems which are susceptible to the legionnella bacteria were kept under constant and careful surveillance as a standard measure aimed at public health and safety, then this outbreak of legionnaire's disease may have been avoided. It is a tragedy that four people have now had to die to force health authorities to clean up the air-conditioning systems. The need to keep these systems clean should have been enforced years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the New South Wales Government is bringing in new regulations, which I understand will come into effect next month, aimed mainly at keeping air-conditioning systems clean and preventing disease outbreaks like this from occurring, they come too late to save the lives of four men who have now died needlessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation ensuring the upkeep of water cooled air-conditioners should have been brought in following the major outbreak of legionnaire's disease in Wollongong in 1987 which killed 10 people and was traced to an air-conditioner in a Wollongong shopping centre. However, it took a second major outbreak of the disease three years ago, which was tracked down to Merrylands Bowling Club, again in Sydney's south-western suburbs, and which killed three people, to get the State Government to take notice of this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental inspectors checking water cooled air-conditioning systems have been reported as saying that many building owners were not maintaining their systems on a regular basis anyway, as is required by the Public Health Act 1991, which forces strict monitoring and cleaning of air-conditioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current outbreak of legionnaire's disease was first reported five days ago on 23 April following the deaths of three men confirmed to have been carrying the legionnella bacteria. By the afternoon of 23 April there were more than 100 suspected cases of legionnaire's disease, all being people who had been hospitalised with unexplained pneumonia since 5 April. However, it was not until 24 April that the New South Wales Health Department ordered water cooling towers on buildings in south-western Sydney to be shut down if they had not been cleaned in the past month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relatives of the disease's latest victim are reported as saying that they are worried that the Health Department was not prompt enough in alerting the public to the outbreak of the disease and in forcing building owners to clean their air-conditioning systems. It is too late for their loved one and for the others who have died for the Health Department to be now ordering the shutdown of dirty systems. They should have been routinely and continually checked by health authorities and building managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fairfield has become the centre of concern as the source of the disease outbreak. It has been widely reported that a local shopping centre may have been the cause of the legionnella bacteria. These reports have failed to mention, however, that local clubs and other buildings with large air-conditioning systems are also under suspicion. Local businesses are concerned that trading has suffered following the announcement by health officials that they suspected a Fairfield shopping centre to be the centre of the legionnaire's disease outbreak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opinion that health authorities should have tested the suspected areas before making their findings public is reasonable, considering that many businesses will suffer from this disease scare whether they use water cooled air-conditioning systems or not. As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, 25 April:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shoppers abandoned stores in Fairfield (on Friday) because health authorities identified the area as the likely source of the deadly Legionnaire's Disease.</PARA>
<PARA>The article said that shopkeepers and store managers had received a flood of phone calls from concerned customers wanting to know if it was safe to go shopping. I hope and pray that no more deaths will result from the current outbreak of this dreadful disease and that new legislation will be adhered to by all building owners who use their air-conditioning systems, which are susceptible to breeding the legionnella bacteria, so that another outbreak like this will never occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospitals in Sydney's south-west, particularly Fairfield and Liverpool hospitals, have been battling to help patients who are suffering from the disease. They are concerned about not being about to stretch resources far enough if the outbreak spreads. To all those who are suffering at this stage I extend my sympathy, as I do to the families who have lost their loved ones. I believe this need not have occurred if the proper Acts had been in place and if proper care had been taken to make sure that those types of air-conditioning systems which had been recognised had been maintained and, more particularly, had been cleaned as they should have been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Sunday afternoon I attended a tribute arranged by one of my constituents, Mrs Edith Irving, to commemorate the life of her late husband, Phil Irving. When Phil Irving MBE died on 14 January this year, Australia lost one of her most distinguished and talented sons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Phil, who was born in 1903, was truly a legend in his own lifetime, and in many ways he was also a man ahead of his time. Although recognised nationally and internationally for his outstanding contributions and achievements during a lifetime of dedicated involvement in the highly specialised and challenging field of automotive engineering, I think it is fair to say that Phil did not receive the widespread public acknowledgment, approbation and recognition that he had undoubtedly earned and so richly deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, owing to direct television coverage and multimillion dollar sponsorships and promotions, motorcycle racing and car racing enjoy a significant and increasing level of public interest, popularity and support in Australia. We have produced local heroes who have become, quite literally, household names in this country and overseas. But before most of the current crop of motor racetrack idols had been born, or even thought of, Phil Irving had already built an enviable reputation and achieved impressive and unique success at a national and international level in both motorcycle and motor car racing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was involved principally as a designer and engineer, but was also a participant and competitor. He also wrote numerous technical books and articles, and his best known work, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tuning for Speed</EMPHASIS>, has been printed in three languages and six editions. Many of Phil Irving's major triumphs remain unsurpassed in quantity, quality and variety. For example, he is and will probably remain the only person in the world to have designed both motorcycle engines and car engines that have held world titles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1930s and 1940s he was employed by the Vincent HRD Co. in England. As chief engineer for Vincent, he designed and built the legendary Black Lightning and Black Shadow motorcycles. The Black Shadow, which was capable of speeds of 180 miles an hour, dominated bike racing and land speed records for many years. In the mid-1960s Phil was commissioned by Repco-Brabham to design and build a stop-gap Formula 1 engine. It was this engine that was used by Sir Jack Brabham when he won the world championship in 1966 and by his team-mate Denis Hulme when he won the series the following year. In recognition of his outstanding automotive engineering contributions and achievements, Phil Irving was awarded the MBE in the 1977 New Year's Honours list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Phil only a relatively short time ago, in 1984, just after I had been elected as member for Casey. I knew his wife, Edith, and she introduced me to her husband one afternoon when I was visiting their Warrandyte home. In some ways that first meeting was fairly traumatic. Phil spent some time explaining that, although he was pleased I had been successful in the election, I had in fact defeated somebody he personally liked and admired very much&mdash;of course, I refer to the former member for Casey, Peter Steedman. Phil made no bones about pointing out that whilst he might not have been all that enthusiastic about Steedman's politics, he could not be all that bad because, after all, he was a Vincent motorcycle enthusiast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past eight years I met Phil and Edith on many occasions. It was always a delight listening to Phil recounting how his early interest in motorcycles developed into what can probably be best described as a life-long love affair. Phil Irving was a generous and sincere person: always good company, bright, approachable and ready to share his vast wealth of knowledge and experience. He certainly did not suffer fools gladly, but if one had a technical problem and asked Phil for help he was always ready, willing and able to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He took enormous pride in and gained tremendous satisfaction from his work. Doing the job properly and doing it right were far more important considerations to him than financial or personal gain or reward. Like countless others, I admired Phil tremendously and will miss him very much indeed. But there is little doubt that so long as motorcycle and racing car enthusiasts gather together to remember the good old days&mdash;in many ways, the pioneering days of automotive engineering&mdash;Phil Irving's name will always be revered, respected and never forgotten. He was a gentleman, a genius and, indeed, a truly very great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I attended in Adelaide the fiftieth anniversary dinner of the formation of Z Special Unit. It has a reputation as a shadowy unit which has only recently been unveiled. In fact, I found that its story is rather simpler than that and concerns Australia's secret war in defence of itself involving clandestine operations during World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the desperate situation in which the Australian nation found itself in early 1942, methods were devised that would strike in the enemy-held territory at critical points with small parties that could wreak havoc&mdash;could strike, run and escape. This was the vision of a secret war; a war about which few people knew until the 1970s as this unit was sworn to secrecy for 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To implement this war, a unit of specially trained men and women was formed&mdash;a unit that would eventually blow up oil tanks in Sumatra, sink shipping in Singapore harbour, form an attack force in the jungles of Borneo and monitor the death march from Sandakan to Ranau. It was to be known as Z Special Unit. This was formed in early 1942. It was first intended to use Singapore as its operational base, but the early capitulation of that city precluded that possibility and Australia became the logical and eventual choice for Z headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Thomas Blamey gave the organisation his full personal support and later, in 1944, Sir Kenneth Wills of South Australia became controller of the Allied Intelligence Bureau. All three branches of the armed forces were involved in Z Special. All personnel volunteered to join Z and then, in turn, volunteered for operations behind enemy lines, of which there were 78. Casualties were very high. 200 Flight, of Liberators, consisting of six planes, was attached and, of these, three planes were lost during operations, together with 40 per cent of Z operatives. The many awards for bravery were well earned during the 78 operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1944, the persistence of a steadily growing band of Australian service men and women supported by some British technicians had created a unit capable of raising the flag of resistance at any point within the far-flung enemy-occupied areas which then stretched throughout the south-west Pacific and South East Asia. I will mention a couple of these operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Singapore on 2 September 1943, Operation Jaywick was undertaken, involving a party <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>who left Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Krait </EMPHASIS>carrying limpet mines, foldboats, arms and rations. Limpets were attached to the hulls of several Japanese ships and perhaps some 360,000 tonnes of Japanese shipping was sunk. In August 1944 a second attempt to undertake the same kind of operation proved disastrous. The party was discovered by Malays and Japanese and in the running battles some were killed, some escaped and some were captured. Of those who escaped, little is known; but those who were captured were beheaded in Singapore on 7 July 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Borneo in March 1945, Operation Agas was undertaken when a party was inserted into British North Borneo. Its mission was to establish a base, set up intelligence networks, conduct subversive activities and obtain some detailed information on the POW camp at Sandakan, in which were held nearly 2,500 allied servicemen of whom little had been heard. The party remained in the area until June, relaying information on the size, strength and position of Japanese troops. A similar operation was parachuted in later in March 1945&mdash;Operation Semut 1&mdash;and the party stayed there for months, gathering vital information and intelligence and accounting for a large number of Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I relate these points because last week the South Australian branch of the Z Special Unit hosted in Adelaide the fiftieth anniversary of the unit's formation. About 300 Z Special Unit personnel marched in the Anzac Day march and last night was their reunion dinner. I thank them for their hospitality. But that was not what impressed me most. What impressed me was the gathering of a number of modest Australian heroes, now aged between 69 years and their early seventies, who 50 years ago shared in the successful defence of Australian national territory. For this, of course, they are to be commended and they will be forever remembered. </PARA>

As from 1 July, this Government will require him to take out a superannuation policy for his employee&mdash;the 3 per cent compulsory contribution. That amounts to a premium of between $30 and $40 per month.

Nevertheless, the Government is proceeding with this. The superannuation companies are not able and not willing to provide a cover for that single employee. </PARA>

It has become more relevant in the last week in regard to tariffs. What is relevant about it is the position of both the Government and the Opposition. The Government made it very clear today that our position is that tariffs are coming down to $55 a tonne as of 1 July and that a committee will be formed, which I am very pleased to chair, to look at the impact of the Industry Commission report that will be released this week and also at the issue of tariffs, which is part of the IC report.

<PARA>I do understand the frustration of the Leader of the Opposition, because he does have to deal with some people in Queensland who have strange attitudes&mdash;the Leader of the National Party in the Senate is one of them. It is interesting that this great industry, which created regional Queensland, has been the industry that has broken the fabric&mdash;not only the bricks but also the mortar&mdash;of the Fightback package. In Queensland today, Fightback is dead and buried.

I cannot for the life of me understand why he has raised this flag issue. All the polls tell him that he is on a loser. I am beginning to wonder whether it might be that he has come to the realisation that his term as Prime Minister will be very short-lived. It may be that what we are seeing now is an agenda that he has had close to his heart for many years and he intends getting it off his chest before he is removed from the prime ministership of this country. </PARA>

My region has an unofficial unemployment rate of something approaching 25 per cent, and a youth unemployment rate of between 35 and 40 per cent, and here we have the greatest smokescreen that I have seen in the two years that I have been in this place. </PARA>

Queensland has long maintained a policy of holding mineral royalties at comparatively low levels, while retaining coal rail freights that include a substantial profit (effectively a tax) component which adds directly to costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this regime, mine profitability has been affected by the date of development rather than by the economic efficiencies and locational advantages of particular mines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland has had its coal rail freight arrangements under review since February 1990. The review has since been subsumed into a review of overall mineral taxation in the State. A move to a mineral taxation system which is transparent and which treats each company equitably would be strongly supported by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of reforms to government taxation and charges, the Commonwealth Government will be seeking to establish a suitable process for further consultation with the Queensland Government on the issue of rail freight rates for the coal industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State taxes and charges imposed on the coal industry are clearly outside the Commonwealth's direct powers of reform. However, whenever possible, the Government has consistently argued for reforms to state rail freight charges. The Queensland Government's review into its taxation treatment of coal rail freight provides an important opportunity for the Commonwealth to press its case for a less distortionary system of collecting a community return. For this reason, Queensland rail freight rates were specifically identified as a prospective reform target in the coal industry policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is aware that the New South Wales State Rail Authority is moving towards greater efficiency and reform and notes efforts by the SRA in recent years to reduce coal freight rates in real terms. The NSW coal industry acknowledges that reforms have been made and expects further improvements to emerge from coal companies' on-going discussions with the SRA. The Commonwealth Government will continue to monitor the progress of discussions between the coal industry and the SRA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, following the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq, the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, gave an undertaking to the Grains Council of Australia in August 1990, which he again reiterated in Parliament on 17 April 1991, that "no industry could be expected to carry the financial burden of sanctions (against Iraq) single handed".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) is owed US$481.2 million for wheat sold to Iraq on credit and delivered prior to the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions in August 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the AWB's export credit insurance contract, the Government accepts 80% (70% for some shipments) of the risk of non-payment while the AWB accepts the remainder. The Commonwealth's exposure is US$385.3 million while the AWB's uninsured exposure is US$95.9 million. To the end of February 1992 the Government had paid US$314.8m (A$405m) to the AWB under its export credit insurance. Payments are made to the AWB in US dollars, the denomination of the AWB's contracts with Iraq. Conversion to Australian dollars is made at the exchange rate prevailing on the day of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) An ex-gratia payment of $31 million was made to the AWB in October 1991 for losses arising from the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq. This payment covered losses on contracted tonnages of wheat and associated costs involved in reselling that wheat to alternative markets. The AWB accepted the payment as full and final settlement with the Government for their losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No further steps will be taken to refund the uninsured portion of the debt referred to in part (2), nor is there any basis for doing so. National Interest insurance was sought and provided because the risk of non-payment was high. The Government took a deliberate decision to limit the AWB's cover to 70- 80%. This arrangement was accepted by the AWB as the basis of conducting business in Iraq. National Interest insurance claim payments are being made on the basis of the terms agreed to by the AWB. Iraq has acknowledged the debt owed to Australia and has indicated it will pay all amounts due as required under UN Resolution 687.</PARA>
