<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Throsby)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a short statement to the House regarding the inquiry by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works into the proposal by the Civil Aviation Authority to construct air traffic services centres at Brisbane and Melbourne. This project was referred to the Committee by the House on 26 February 1992. As I made clear at the Committee's first public hearing on 8 April, the role of the Committee is to examine and report to the Parliament on the building works involved with the Australian advanced air traffic system project, or TAAATS. The main component of the TAAATS project is the consolidation of the five major air traffic control centres to two centres, Brisbane and Melbourne. The cost estimate of the building works when referred to the Committee was $50m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that honourable members are aware that there has been considerable controversy regarding the CAA's decision to name Thomson Radar as the preferred contractor for TAAATS. The CAA has also announced that the Hughes Aircraft Co. is the alternative contractor. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Committee has attempted to stay clear of issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract, it has proved to be impossible. In fact, I stressed at the beginning of the inquiry that the Committee did not wish to involve itself in issues relating to the TAAATS equipment contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's task has been made difficult owing to the turnkey nature of the contract for the TAAATS project. Under the turnkey contract the successful contractor will also be responsible for the provision of the building works. This has presented the Committee with a situation where very few details of the building works have been made available to it. However, this is a matter on which the Committee will comment in detail in its report, which will be tabled in the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the principal role of the Public Works Committee is to satisfy itself of the need for public works. However, section 17 (1b) of the Public Works Committee Act, while empowering the Committee to make a report to both Houses of the Parliament concerning the expedience of carrying out a public work, also provides that the Committee may report to the Parliament concerning any other matters related to the work in respect of which the Committee thinks it desirable that the view of the Committee should be reported to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite arguments put by the CAA and an impertinent letter from the Chairman of the CAA, Mr Butcher, my Committee did not exceed its mandate. It is surprising that key officials of the CAA and key witnesses before a parliamentary committee did not bother to familiarise themselves with the role and duty of the Public Works Committee. My Committee found the comments by Mr Butcher impertinent and insulting, as he attempted to lecture the Committee on its role. The members of the Public Works Committee are well aware of their role and duty and do not need to be lectured to by bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was also frustrated in the exercise of its duty by the unwillingness or inability of key CAA witnesses to answer relevant questions. Reluctantly the Committee conducted two in-camera hearings, but even with this protection the CAA witnesses were still unwilling or unable to answer key questions. By their refusing to answer these questions even in the general terms sought by the Committee, the Committee finds itself in the position of being unable to fulfil its duty to this Parliament. The Committee believes it would be failing in its duty if it did not bring to the attention of the House the concerns which have been expressed during the Committee's inquiry regarding the CAA's decision to award the equipment contract to Thomson. These concerns include the following: whether the Thomson equipment is the best available; whether the selection process conducted by the CAA was doctored to favour the Thomson bid; and why the preference of the technical and operational evaluation teams for Hughes was overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, the Committee  has decided to take the unprecedented step of recommending that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review of all aspects of the awarding of this contract to Thomson. This review should be completed as a matter of urgency so that the CAA can appoint a final contractor with a minimum of delay. The Public Works Committee stresses that this issue is too important for it not to be settled as soon as possible. The Committee feels that, because of the serious concerns it has regarding the TAAATS project, it cannot report to the Parliament until this review is completed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Arguably this reference has been the most difficult for the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in the last four or five years. That process has not been assisted by CAA officials and their ambivalence, some hostility and a refusal, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has said, to answer pertinent questions in the public interest. As he also said, it has been impossible for the Public Works Committee to divorce the bricks and mortar element of about $50m from the more costly  hardware and software elements of TAAATS, which make up about 80 per cent of the projected cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both responsible Ministers, Senator Collins and Senator Cook, must be left in no doubt, as the result of the statement this morning, that there are three big question marks that persist in terms of, firstly, the technical and operational aspects which, on the evidence presented both in camera and in open forum, leave unanswered questions concerning the rationale for selecting the Thomson bid over the Hughes bid; secondly, the tendering process and its unorthodox variations by CAA in this project; and, finally, the role of the CAA board in the whole process of this sorry state of affairs. Much of this has been the subject of media comment and debate over the last couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Ministers need to understand the degree to which this project could raise further questions of public accountability if left unattended. My Committee colleagues and I are concerned that a public scandal is in the making if the Ministers do not take action to have it reviewed by an independent expert panel. This Parliament and the Australian people deserve nothing less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and his Committee on the way they have handled this matter so far and on bringing it to the attention of the House. Quite obviously, there is serious concern in many quarters concerning this contract, the tendering process and the recommendations of the CAA. But now I feel these concerns are overshadowed by the amazing attitude to tendering and public accountability expressed by a senior officer of the CAA, Dr Edwards, and the Chairman of the CAA Board, Mr Butcher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have these two public servants presided over, at best, a highly unorthodox tendering procedure involving around $300m of public funds, but also they have refused to provide tender information to a parliamentary committee. Their actions in refusing the requests of the Committee are not only illegal, but also are an unashamed, basic rejection of any proper process of public administration. As such, I believe that they should be removed from their office along with those board members who have endorsed their decision, irrespective of the result of the inquiry into the tenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the history of this tender and the recent conflicts of interest on the CAA Board with various appointments, there is no question that a shake-up is long overdue. The pathetic excuse for refusing to divulge information has been rightly dismissed by the Attorney-General's Department and, frankly, after 20-odd years of assessing public tenders in a professional capacity, I can say that when I hear the term commercial-in-confidence, the only thing to do is to press the alarm bells and put one's hands on one's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last decade, there has been an endless series of corruption scandals concerning the awarding of contracts around the world, involving everyone from national governments to the smallest subcontractor. The common factor of all those scandals is secrecy. When dealing with public money, not only does the public have a right to know, but also those involved should want to avoid charges of corruption. The only defence against that is openness. Public tenders must be as open as possible at all times. The potential for corruption cannot be ignored as the Royal Commission into the Building Industry in New South Wales has shamefully underlined. Dr Edwards is already, I understand, subject to a parliamentary inquiry in New Zealand for the last contract he managed there and it is clear that his attitude to public administration is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter from the Chairman of the Board, Mr Butcher, to the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, in which he strongly disagrees with the right of either the Committee or the public to know tender prices, and even disputes that it is any business of parliament, is elitist at best and it breaches the basic principles of public accountability. I strongly support the inquiry as recommended by the Chairman of the Committee, but I hope that the inquiry will be open to the public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to provide a matching grant with the industry, dollar for dollar, which the Government will also subsidise. It was introduced in 1987. At the moment, the maximum rate is 10c per tonne of cane, which should be equally divided between the grower and the miller. I understand that, until last season, it had been put in by regulation at 6c a tonne and that, from now on, it is to be 10c per tonne. There is no doubt that as this rises from 10c to 15c, there will be further calls on both industry and the Government for additional assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds support the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Commonwealth is committed to matching SRDC expenditure, dollar for dollar, up to a limit of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production of sugarcane. It is suggested that the current maximum levy of 15c per tonne represents 0.29 per cent of gross value of production; still less than 0.5 per cent. The Commonwealth's estimated contribution for 1992-93 will be $3.15m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the 0.5 per cent of gross value of production as against the 0.29 per cent, it is interesting to see that somebody has omitted in the calculations to take into account the 12c per tonne that is paid to the Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations by the farmers, the 5c per tonne for productivity groups within the industry in various areas, and also the fairly considerable levy that is paid by the sugar mills to the Sugar Research Institute. If those three additional amounts had been taken into account, I am sure that the 0.5 per cent of gross value production would be exceeded. So the suggestion that the industry is being under-researched is not true, as was indicated by that comparison. If the 14c maximum levy is paid by regulation, this would mean an expenditure of $280 per annum for an average size Queensland farm of 4,000 tonnes, spread over some 6,000 growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This additional cost is recognised by canefarmers as essential in order to maintain their efficient record as an industry in continuing research and development. Besides the proposed 7c per tonne, as I mentioned before, the growers do pay the Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations and the productivity groups. Research and development is well recognised within the industry. The only reason the sugar industry is in its present efficient state is that the effective research and development programs have given the canegrowers the current efficiencies they want maintained today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look outside this type of research and development, we see that many farmers have turned to thrash blanketing, minimum tillage and contour farming to ensure the continuation of the land as a viable resource. Many of the by-products of the milling&mdash;for instance, filter mud and, in some cases, molasses&mdash;are returned as nutrients to the soil. These are costs borne by the sugar industry in the face of the reduction in tariffs from $76 per tonne to $55 per tonne on 1 July 1992, which means further losses to an average Queensland farm of some $1,300 and about $3,600 for a New South Wales farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, of the SRDCs 9 members, three have close associations with cane farming and milling. The Deputy Chairman is Mr Kelso Greenwood, a constituent of mine from Proserpine, there is a practical person from Bundaberg and also somebody from the New South Wales industry. That leaves six people who are more technically inclined than people who have the experience within the industry itself. There was a rather interesting comment made at the Agricultural Outlook Conference this year that the people who are attracted to that conference are more and more the technocrats and less and less the farmers. In fact, on the night of the wonderful speech by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), at my table&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Crean" NAMEID="DT4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bet you did, too. At my table of 10, there was just one farmer, Kelso Greenwood. This means that 90 per cent of the people at my table&mdash;and I would assume 90 per cent of the people attending the conference&mdash;now look after technical matters and financial interests. The farmers, the graziers, cannot attend these conferences because they cannot afford it. It is getting more and more out of hand. I hope that the SRDC does not take that view in the long term. People do need that practical experience, particularly in a research and development group, to do what should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this particularly because economic rationalism seems to have taken over from practical advice and experience of the farmers and graziers around Australia. If we want a good example of that, I think we only need to read the Industry Commission's report, where some of these economists rush through an area and become five-minute experts in an industry that is very difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only to look at the Industry Commission report to get a good example. The sugar industry is told that by world comparisons it is the most efficient of any of the world's sugar industries, particularly in cane sugar, and I believe it is the only developed country selling sugar from cane on the export market. Its competitors are Third World developing countries. With the 5 per cent preference, that is not an easy position to maintain. It has achieved this rate of efficiency only because it has continued to support research and development. Even the farmers and people in the industry have contributed to this. I would like to mention a person in my own city of Mackay, Mick Hodge, who is always developing implements necessary to keep pace with the technical advances in farming. I also mention the Toft brothers, harvesters from Bundaberg, who have not only played a massive part in the mechanical harvesting of sugar in Australia but also earn export dollars in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given reasonable weather and other conditions, the Queensland industry can match any sugar industry in the world. But it is still saddled with costs that our competitors do not face. The European Community, Thailand and many other sugar producing countries do not face the extra costs that are embedded within the Australian industry&mdash;not only the sugar industry but right across the board. When I mention wholesale sales tax, I know the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will immediately say that there is no sales tax in connection with the sugar industry. That is not true. He knows the cascading effect of sales  tax  that  is  built  into  the  services for which farmers and manufacturers have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is payroll tax. Again, somebody says that payroll tax is not paid by canefarmers. We made this allegation, not to a canefarmers' meeting, but to a meeting in Bowen of the growers of small vegetables. We said, `We know that you do not pay payroll tax, but you get the cascading effect'. Immediately the wrath of one lady descended upon us. She said that her farm paid $65,000 in payroll tax the year before last, and would be continuing to pay payroll tax now. So it is a myth that farmers do not pay payroll tax. Certainly, the cascading effect of payroll tax is very much a part of the costs that they pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industry across the board also bears an excessive fuel excise compared with overseas competitors. At 26c a litre&mdash;and not all of that being rebated as far as the diesel subsidy is concerned&mdash;that is a big on-farm cost. We can now look at the 3 per cent superannuation levy as from 1 July. As the levy and those costs are incurred across Australia, labour will be put off, adding to the unemployment pool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might also talk in terms of the income tax regime which the Australian farmer faces in good times as opposed to those in overseas markets. The graziers and farmers of Australia have gradually reached the position where they are now unable to pay tax because of the dramatic change in market conditions and weather conditions right across Australia, and also because of the impact of additional costs within their inputs. As a result of this, not too many of them pay the income tax that ordinary Australians pay, but we cannot say this with any joy. Farmers of today are being pushed into the peasant mentality&mdash;the new rural poor as opposed to their situation several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time we have seen such things as income equalisation deposits taken out of the system. I know that income equalisation deposits still exist, but they are of no effect whatsoever in equalising income from one year to another and in providing farmers with their own equalisation scheme, which is so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the direct inputs and costs that Australian farmers face as against farmers in other countries. I mention also that our canefarmers, our millers and our marketeers of sugar, along with other industries, suffer massively from the need for labour market reform, transport reform and waterfront reform. We need only take one or two of those to indicate what might happen. For instance, I understand that sugar can be freighted from Bangkok to Sydney at exactly the same rate as it can be freighted from Bundaberg to Sydney or from Mackay to Sydney. The cabotage arrangements in Australia, which exclude foreign flag shipping, mean that it costs the average Queensland canegrower $437 a year because of those extra freight costs. We do not have that competitive aspect operating in other fields; yet the Industry Commission expects it to operate within the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk in terms of waterfront reform. It has been necessary to bulk transport the sugar to other markets, especially those further south, in order to get the best rates. Waterfront reform is necessary in order to add the value to our product that the Industry Commission suggests. It talks about the added value in various areas, but if Australia had an efficient waterfront, whereby we could move the same number of containers as is the case in the rest of the world, we could refine our sugar, package it in the way that it is necessary and enter into a competitive market with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggested to the Sugar Board three or four years ago that there was a market for refined sugar in a Pacific destination. I was told then that it would cost about $68 per tonne to get that sugar across the wharf as compared with the cost of the bulk sugar. That is because of the smaller packaging and the fact that it has to be containerised and subject to the unions' lack of productivity in this regard. When I was in Hong Kong about two years ago, a boat could be put in the harbour&mdash;it was not berthed&mdash;unloaded by barges and cranes, and turned around within 24 hours. I believe that we have to have some significant amount of waterfront reform in that connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's policy is well and truly on the table in regard to labour market reform. I believe that additional profit could be gained by farmers and millers if they engaged in the practice of employers and employees talking to each other across the table, and not through a centralised wage fixing system. Obviously all of these costs are a massive burden on the Queensland sugar industry. When 80 per cent of its crop is exported as it tries to compete in the world market, where its premium sugar and reliability give it priority access, but not at a premium price, these are obviously very important items. If we could allow the industry to operate free of those costs and without those burdens, it would probably enjoy a much better place in that world market than it does at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission is said by a prominent industry leader to be a joke. That is probably repeated by every canefarmer throughout Queensland. He said it is made up of theoretical economists from Canberra who have not had any exposure to the real world and should be replaced with more practical people. The sort of person it employs, of course, is an economist from within a department who has the security of a 9 to 5 job and does not want too much exposure to the outside. Such people go out and talk to certain individuals and come back making assumptions without knowing the reality of working at the coalface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of everything that has been said in the Industry Commission report, the fact is that the sugar industry is said to be the most efficient in the world. The industry continues to pay for its own research and development in more ways than the Bill would suggest. It is also a fact that massive restructuring has already taken place throughout the industry: the embargo has been removed; a Queensland sugar industry corporation has been established; the Sugar Cane Prices Board has been removed; land assignments have been opened up and transfers of these assignments have been provided for; and some sugar mills have amalgamated. In fact, quite a few have closed down. In my electorate two sugar mills have ceased to function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that our bulk sugar terminals are the most efficient in the world. The Queensland sugar industry exports its sugar against the most corrupt competition, particularly from the European Community and Thailand, because of the massive subsidisation of domestic prices which feed into international exports and reduce the effective world price. I notice that the Industry Commission report says that subsidisation does not affect the world price. Of course it does. If the production which has been grown under the benefits of fairly high domestic pricing arrangements is surplus to growers' requirements, they can afford to put it on the world market at a substantially lower price. If that practice has encouraged overproduction of sugar, there will be an automatic reduction in the world price of sugar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry has to retain its present level of efficiency in order to compete against internal costs imposed by government and the external factor of subsidisation within world markets. It does this with the exchange rate at a dirty float which decreases the dollar by about 10 per cent. It has been suggested&mdash;I am not an economist; if I were I would not be talking about them in this way&mdash;that the dollar is floating at the dirty rate of about 10 per cent above its value. If it were reduced to its proper level there would be a massive increase in income from that 80 per cent of the Queensland crop that goes onto the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission basically recommends a one-off payment of $47m to remove the tariffs in the 1992 season, provided that the Queensland State Government deregulates the rest of the industry and removes assignments. I believe that effective control by assignments is actually dead now from the point of view of what has happened over the last few years. To suggest that the deregulation should include the removal of assignments is not listening to what is happening in the industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, with that removal, the Commission recommends the removal of the one marketeer of sugar concept. This would have to be done with the concurrence of the State Government. What this does is provide for broad acre farming. With the complete removal of the tariff, we are providing for broad acre farming and marketing of sugar right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said that John Andrews, in his term as Chairman of the Sugar Board, was probably the most effective controller of the market that we have had. I know of occasions when CSR was the one market seller onto the world market and it was suggested by John Andrews that other players would be brought into the market. Apparently the threat had some effect because CSR was not moved from its sole position. In the one market seller position, the hedging of prices and buying of futures were undertaken at great benefit to the Queensland industry and to the whole sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that with the removal of tariffs all these things should come into place. If we sell off the efficient sugar terminals to private concerns, the question of who owns the sugar terminals comes up. What has happened over a number of years is that, while governments have borrowed funds to establish sugar terminals, the farmers have paid for those terminals by a reduction in the sugar price year by year. All these things are to be done with the concurrence of the Industry Commission which says that there is no improvement necessary to the current anti-dumping measures. Nobody in the industry believes that the current anti-dumping measures will be sufficient. </PARA>

I suppose some people will say, `Well, Canadian pork is actually Australian pork'. The unfortunate fact about this case is that the packet had very clear instructions as to where it was packed and manufactured.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had calls from the industry suggesting that, as with the dairy industry, the Minister himself should take complete control of the Industry Commission's report into sugar; that he and the Minister for Primary Industries in Queensland, Mr Casey, should take control and not leave the matter in the hands of somebody from the back bench. After all, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who is at the table, has taken great credit for the fact that he had sole intervention in the Industry Commission's report into the dairy industry and achieved a splendid result. I believe that the sugar industry deserves no less than that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing here is that the consumers are pleading for a reduction in tariffs. But I suggest that there has been no reduction in prices as a result of that decrease from $90 to $76 last season.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point about the confectioners. There will not be one cent of reduction in their prices. I suggest to the confectioners that a reduction in the price of their product will come from labour reform, waterfront reform and all those other aspects that are part of our package. It is very important that these reforms should take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the aspect of opening up assignments, the Industry Commission report overlooks the fact that 48,000 hectares have been allocated for additional assignment within Queensland and these have not yet been taken up or come into production. While some of it may be a timing matter, basically what has happened is that people would not want to buy assignments in Queensland at the moment because they are not worth anything. That is the situation. Those 45,000 hectares are still out of production because of the costs involved in sugar farming these days. With the infrastructure and maintenance costs, people realise that it is not possible even in the best of circumstances within the Burdekin to put this ground under cane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a limit to the soil available. The Industry Commission report makes some grand calculation that $500m worth of extra exports could be gained from opening up the industry. It ignores the fact that the best soil has already been taken up. Some of the soils that have already been taken up have to be farmed differently from soils in the past because of their inappropriateness. On top of that, we have the increasing challenge from all people around Australia to look at our heritage to make sure that it is not degraded to any greater extent. All of that flies in the face of the report of the Industry Commission, which has not had the opportunity to have an in-depth look at this right across the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as a farmer is concerned today, two-thirds of the price of the cane represents the wages and input costs; only one-third is then available for the payment of the rates, the farmers' own wages and interest on mortgage repayments. So there is a very thin line and that line has been reduced again this year because of Labor's reduction in the tariff from $76 to $55 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry has never been slow in making sure that proper research and development has gone into the industry, with the support of the various institutes and bodies right around Australia. We find that CSR, CSIRO and even ABARE itself are participating, through the various grants, to further the interests of the sugar industry. Australians generally should understand that, if it had not been for the sugar industry, the decentralisation of the population of Queensland would never have taken place. They owe a lot over many decades to the efforts of those 6,000 farmers within the Queensland sugar industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased, as the only member in this House who owns a sugarcane farm, to support the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugarcane to 15c per tonne, as provided for in section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act of 1987. The Bill has been prepared following a request from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request was made by the Australian Cane Growers Council, represented by Canegrowers, and the Australian Cane Farmers Association on behalf of the sugarcane growers, and the Australian Sugar Milling Council on behalf of the millers of sugarcane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sugar Cane Levy Act of 1987 provides for an industry levy on sugarcane produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill to provide funds for the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The Act provides for a maximum rate of levy which is currently set at 10c per tonne of sugarcane. The Government provides funding to match the industry levies up to 0.5 per cent of the annual gross value of production in line with the established policy of encouraging increased rural productivity and profitability through research and commercialisation of research findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry is committed to industry funded research and wishes to increase its commitment to the Commonwealth scheme through an increased levy in order to maintain its competitive export and domestic market position. The current rate of levy is 6c per tonne. However, the sugar industry has indicated its wish to increase that levy to 14c per tonne for the 1992 season. The current maximum levy rate of 10c per tonne is thus hindering this increase and so preventing the sugar industry from utilising the full potential of the Commonwealth R&amp;D scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I would like to pay tribute to Mr Don Byth, who is head of the Sugar Research Development Corporation, and also the acting Chairman, Mr Kelso Greenwood of Proserpine, not only for his commitment as a canefarmer and chairman of the Proserpine canegrowers but also for the hospitality he has shown me in the time he has given to take me through the Proserpine district to look at some of the problems that the growers have there and for his willingness to contribute, as with all the executive canegrowers throughout Queensland, to the committee that I have been asked to chair to look at the Industry Commission report.

I will tell him that the canegrowers want it to take a year; they want it to take time. I will tell him why they want it to take time. It is because it has taken 77 years since T.J.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is that the Opposition is committed to the IC report and to zero tariffs. It does not matter what those two turkeys from the National Party on the back bench say, that happens to be a fact. It might be embarrassing for the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Wide Bay but, if they are not prepared to stand up and say that they support the IC report and zero tariffs, they should resign from parliament, because that is the Opposition's policy. They do not like to be exposed, any more than do the Queensland Nationals like to be exposed for corruption. I understand why they are dirty because they have been shown to be fools up in Mackay, Maryborough and right throughout the sugar industry. The facts are that the coalition at the Federal level is committed to the IC report and to zero tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and my committee have worked closely with the dairy industry and we have come up with a package that is not only acceptable but welcomed by the dairy farmers of Australia. Indeed, John Watson and Pat Rowley came to see my committee yesterday and said, `We are very pleased and we want to say thanks for putting together, in cooperation with the industry, a very sensible package'. That is what we are committed to do with sugar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that these two blokes on the National Party back bench do not want that. They want to say one thing up home in their constituencies, to please the backwoods regulators and the State National Party administration to whom they owe their allegiance and control, and come down here and try to sound like statesmen. Well, they cannot walk on either side of the barbed wire fence, as one of their former State colleagues used to say. They have tried to do it and they have suffered the consequences. But that is not my fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of argument from those opposite, saying, `Well, look, we are going to abolish tariffs in line with abolishing some taxes; the taxes that we will abolish will compensate'. I will go through the taxes that they say they will abolish. First of all, they will abolish the wholesale sales tax. We have made an exemption for wholesale sales tax right across the rural spectrum. So they are going to abolish something that we have already exempted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will also abolish payroll tax. Over the last two years farmers across this country have had it very tough. They would all love to pay payroll tax; they would love to have that problem&mdash;but they do not. There are some horticultural growers who pay payroll tax, and I am more aware of that than anyone else because I have the biggest horticultural centre in Australia in my electorate. But the fact is that that payroll tax is a State tax. Also, cane-farmers do not pay payroll tax&mdash;not one of them; but I bet they wish they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will abolish the excise on petroleum products. Canefarmers do not use petrol to grow cane, and have not done so for 30 years. I guess that shows the thinking of the National Party. Let us just stick to the subject of abolishing excise on petroleum for a second. Those opposite say, `Okay, a lot of farmers have four-wheel drive vehicles and use diesel'. Let us assume that some farmers do use petroleum for their cars, as I do. Those opposite will abolish the petroleum excise. Will that saving be passed on to the consumers? Of course, it will not. It will be held from the top level of fuel companies right down to the distribution point. That money will not be passed on&mdash;and those opposite know it. Not only do they know it; they will also abolish the Prices Surveillance Authority, the very organisation that could make sure the saving was passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better than that, the Federal Government allows a diesel fuel rebate. I support that totally. It is worth half a billions dollars&mdash;$500m. We can call it a subsidy; we can call it a rebate; but it is backing up production of agricultural products. It is there now. One of the other taxes that those opposite will abolish is automatic indexation of excise. If they are to abolish the excise on petroleum, abolishing automatic indexation is not very rational. It does not have any effect at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite will also abolish the training guarantee charge. The honourable member for Dawson said what a great thing that would be. In a smart and clever world and a smart and clever country, the very thing in which we need to be competitive in every industry is training. Training is the very essence of being a smarter country. The backward thinking of the voodoo economists and the Mississippi hicks in the National Party is shown in their wanting to limit the ability for us to be a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this is probably the best of the lot: those opposite will abolish the coal export duty! That will really help canefarmers. I can just see the National Party wading across a cane field saying, `We have some good news for you blokes. We will abolish the coal export duty. That will really make you competitive and that means you can wear zero tariffs, because you will not have to pay any excise on your coal'. The problem is that canefarmers do not export coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look through the taxes proposed by the coalition, we see also the one relating to customs duty. The final one, the seventh one, is a beauty! Those opposite will increase excise on tobacco products by 25 per cent. When the canefarmer who is depressed about zero tariffs and the IC report goes to light up a smoke, he will have to pay 25 per cent more for the privilege. They are the taxes that those opposite want to abolish and increase. According to the Opposition, they will put canefarmers in a better place to wear zero tariffs, to accept the IC report, and on top of all that to accept a 15 per cent goods and services tax. Have those opposite not got some great news for canefarmers? That is about as good as bringing foot-and-mouth disease into this country. </PARA>

These are beauties!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first area mentioned was waterfront reform. We have addressed it and it is in place. It is happening. Of course, those opposite do not want to listen to that. The second area mentioned was transport. Obviously, those opposite are not aware of the One Nation statement. It is interesting that all this week, as we have debated national issues&mdash;whether transport and communications, waterfront reform or whatever&mdash;we have not had one question from those on the other side, from either the National Party or the Liberal Party, on these fundamental issues. They trumpet these ideas out as some grey, flowing areas that will deliver some extra dollars to compensate for a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson was the exchange rate. I do not think he understands that we floated the dollar. Under the characters on the other side with the McEwen monkey on one shoulder and the backwoods regulator on the other, we had an overvalued dollar all through the McEwen, Menzies and Fraser years. The dollar is trading lower than ever before. The other problem relates to what the GST does to exports. It allows inflation to run at about 7 per cent. Our international competitiveness would be destroyed under a GST, yet those opposite have the hide to come in here and talk about exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other facet to this&mdash;the labour market. Those opposite always have an attitude of nastiness in this respect. They are on about taking away wages, award conditions, for millworkers, sugar workers, right across the country. They see that as a way of making us more efficient and of benefiting farmers. Those opposite do not have a very good understanding of the sugar industry, because it has had&mdash;and still has&mdash;the best industrial relations system of any industry in Australia's history. There has been a fundamental understanding that workers in the sugar industry deserve a fair wage. Throughout all the years that the sugar industry has been established, since 1915, we have seen virtually no disputation of any considerable degree. This is because of the understanding that canefarmers and the industry have of the need to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite want to abolish the award system and to bring in voluntary agreements. Of course, they back that up by saying they want troops on the waterfront. Let me tell them that they cannot handle sugar mills and exporting sugar with troops. It will not work. It never has. We have seen what the National Party is like in relation to industrial relations in Queensland. We had it for 32 years. We saw the SEQEB dispute. We saw the marchers in the streets. We saw people dragged off to gaol and, lastly, we saw National Party Ministers dragged off to gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial disputation, industrial turmoil, is not the way to help the sugar industry. Every time it gets down to that, the last thing that those opposite trot out is the argument that, if we attack the workers, it will somehow make us more competitive. The countries that have done well with exports have a good understanding with the work force&mdash;they do not have slave labour. That attitude has never worked in the past and it will not work again. It is about time that those opposite stopped trotting out that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how brave the honourable member for Dawson will be when I speak to some of his rank and file millworkers over the next few weeks and tell them what he has been saying here, that he wants to take money out of their pockets. Let him front up and tell them that he wants to dud every working family in Mackay. Let him tell them that he wants to take away their holiday leave loading. Let him tell them that he wants to take away all the over-award payments. Let him have the courage to say that. He did not have the courage to talk about what zero tariffs were about until he was flushed out like a quail being chased out of a paddock of corn. At the end of the day he has to face his own constituency and tell them that he wants to dud workers and that that is his way of improving the lot of the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another issue that was mentioned related to expanding the production of sugarcane. It is true that some areas have not been taken up. Some of the assignments have not been taken up. There is a reason for that. Every area has peculiarities and some areas are more prone to the opportunity to expand, others are not. That is dependent on circumstances. They are the sorts of things we will be looking at over the next 12 months. I think everyone should know, if they do not already, that there is one area that can put in another one million tonnes of cane tomorrow, given the opportunity; that is, the Tully area, the King Ranch area. That also was not mentioned by people on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that tariffs have been the big issue in the sugar debate over the past few months. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> newspaper reported:</PARA>

It still has not dawned on those opposite, any more than it has dawned on the hillbillies in Tennessee and Mississippi, that this is 1992 and the Leader of the Opposition will drag them screaming into his brave new world.

But a 15 per cent tax will be imposed on farm produce in the Australian market. That is what farmers will get from those characters on the other side of the House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is to increase the maximum research and development levy from 10c to 15c a tonne. The levy is payable on sugarcane produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill. The levy is collected on funds and activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The request for this amendment has come from the Australian Cane Growers Council, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Australian Sugar Milling Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar research is currently poorly supported, with growers providing only 6c a tonne&mdash;or about 0.17 per cent&mdash;of the annual gross value of production. One can compare this figure with meat producers and wool, wheat and oilseed growers, who contribute 0.5 per cent. Canegrowers have recognised that fact and they now want to increase the amount that they pay by 8c a tonne to 14c a tonne. The Government also provides primary industries with a dollar for dollar research and development grant up to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry ranks as one of Australia's most important agricultural industries. As the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) said, it creates jobs and has been a major contributor to decentralising Australia's population. It is a major contributor to the wealth of this nation and it is terribly important in terms of Australia's regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 95 per cent of total Australian sugar production is based in Queensland. A further 5 per cent is produced in northern New South Wales. Perhaps those two figures will reflect the score that we will see in the State of Origin match in Sydney tonight. As a result of widespread drought, the Australian cane harvest in 1991-92 was 23.1 million tonnes&mdash;the lowest harvest since 1979-80 and a fall of 15 per cent on the 1990-91 harvest. I think that reflects the severity of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar production fell by 400,000 tonnes from the 1991 harvest to 3.1 million tonnes. The value of sugar sales from the 1991-92 Australian crop declined by $255m to $949m. Those figures reflect the plight of many sugarcane farmers&mdash;a decline of $255m in the value of the crop&mdash;because those dollars were lost to canefarmers right across Australia. In 1992-93 cane production is forecast to recover to 25 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of research and development cannot be overstated. Australian farmers are recognised throughout the world as leaders in efficiency and productivity. There are several lessons the Queensland and New South Wales sugar farmers could teach the Australian manufacturing sector. The major productivity gains in the last decade have been achieved through the purchase of modern machinery and improved agricultural practices. However, I believe that the productivity gains in these areas have reached the peak and the same levels of increases are going to be difficult to maintain in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmer already works from dawn till dusk and, when needed, thereafter. The cane harvesting process has evolved from the days of cutting cane by hand to the mechanically driven machines operating today. To a certain extent, productivity gains in these areas have come as far as they are likely to in the near future. However, the Australian  cane industry must not stop the search to improve its product. We must maintain the competitive edge that distinguishes the Australian product from the products of other countries. The way to achieve this competitive edge is through research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of this progress lies in genetic engineering. Improved plant varieties, better sugar content, resistance to disease, resistance to drought, and more efficient utilisation of water and soil nutrition, are research projects which will ultimately lead to further efficiency gains. Many such projects are being undertaken with the levies that have already been collected in the past. For example, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a couple of those projects which are already under way and I support the need for research. They are going to be invaluable in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to one project that is being carried out by the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations. Its main objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To produce genetically transformed (transgenic) sugarcane plants expressing agriculturally important genes such as resistance to sugarcane mosaic virus and resistance to the herbicide glyphosate.</PARA>
<PARA>That has the common name of Roundup. That is a terribly important objective and a terribly important project which is going to give the sugar industry much better plants and enable it to use fewer herbicides. It will not only improve the productivity of the cane farmers but also be of benefit to our environment if that project is successful. There is another project in the area of conservation and fallow management techniques for the cane industry. This is being carried out by the Department of Primary Industries in Queensland. Its objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To evaluate three "best bet" reduced tillage fallow management techniques for new plant cane on four different soil types in the Maryborough District.</PARA>
<PARA>That might sound pretty dry sort of research, but it is terribly important. These are the sorts of projects that are going to lead to the productivity gains that we must have if we are to have a viable cane industry in the future. The efforts of such projects will serve ultimately to distinguish the Australian product and ensure a place for Australia amongst the most efficient farmers in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a strong supporter of grower levies collected for the benefit of promotion, research and development. I will briefly declare my interest as a woolgrower and grain grower, and a payer of such levies. I am certainly very supportive of the sugar industry wishing to increase its contribution to research. It is great to see that people are out there trying to help themselves rather than always coming to governments for help. I know that the sugar industry and all agricultural industries appreciate the dollar for dollar contribution that comes from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is all very well to be the best and most efficient farmer or manufacturer in the world, Australia must have access to international markets. There is no point having a product that cannot get access to another market. Therefore, the importance of the GATT round of trade negotiations is imperative. Whilst the current proposal is not all that we as a nation would have hoped for, it is a proposal and it is progress. I believe that the efforts from both sides of the House and all the member countries of the Uruguay Round which have stuck so strongly together will see some progress being made. It is absolutely vital for agriculture in Australia to see progress in this Uruguay Round. I would hope that it is not too long before we see a positive response from the Americans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, sourcing new markets is also imperative to the Australian sugar industry. The potential demand for food and fibres from the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States immediately comes to mind. I was recently in Russia on a project under the agriculture co-operation agreement. Whilst on that trip I took the opportunity to  meet with officials in Moscow. They advised me that Russia plans to import 3.8 million tonnes of raw sugar this year alone. One of the problems that Russia is having, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) would know, is the payment of its existing debts. It  appears that we have this stalemate. Russia is placing priority on food ahead of manufactured products and fibre. I believe that that reflects the need to feed that nation, and because of the acute shortages of food there are huge opportunities for us as a nation to get up there and negotiate the existing outstanding debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian producers do not stand to benefit from this trade unless we can get some action. I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is able to have some influence in this area, because I believe it is a very important subject. The Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) should lead a delegation to Moscow as a matter of urgency in order to explore options for the repayment of this $250m debt to allow the quickest possible resumption of trade. I believe the Australian Government is sitting on its hands over this issue and that is really going to be at the expense of future trade. The opportunities are there now to be part of that reform and assist the Russians. I believe we should be up there negotiating. We should be sending the highest possible delegation; it should not be just bureaucrats. The way I see it, Government members and Ministers need to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of the freedom within the Commonwealth of Independent States will create valuable trading opportunities that will provide a necessary boost to our rural sectors and a welcome injection of funds into regional communities. A very important factor at the moment is that Russia is paying debt according to a schedule. Those who are currently trading foodstuffs can expect to receive preferential treatment. Given this fact, it is imperative that an arrangement be nutted out in order to allow the resumption of trade, not only for the benefit of the Australian sugar industry, but for the benefit of industry across the board. If the Minister is not prepared to take such an initiative, Australia is likely to miss the opportunity of a century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House support the Bill. It is good to see the sugar industry wanting to increase its contribution to research. I hope the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will take up the issue of the Russian debt with the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development. I believe it is very important that we send a mission of the highest possible level to Russia as soon as possible because it will be to the benefit of Australia's future trade relations and it will be to the benefit of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian sugar industry is going through a period of change. The Government's commitment to consultative industry reform is just one example of the changes afoot that should see the industry enter the twenty-first century stronger and more internationally competitive. That consultative approach has been complimented by previous speakers to this Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, and I think their comments need to be reinforced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also would like to reinforce the accolades that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has received from the dairy industry for his role in consulting with that industry and implementing the changes that it saw as being necessary to take the industry through to the twenty-first century. I know that we will see a similar consultative approach to the sugar industry, and the Minister has guaranteed that. I know that the industry is waiting with bated breath, in some sense, but I also know that, in terms of looking at previous results, the industry is certainly pleased to know that the results for the dairy industry have been constructive. I know that the sugar industry is expecting a similar constructive result from this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar is of great importance to my electorate of Richmond in northern New South Wales. So it is with great pleasure that I speak today on the Bill. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) mentioned that the northern New South Wales region produces a smaller proportion of sugar in comparison with the major effort that is made by Queensland. He did get one score wrong, and that was his reference to the State of Origin result tonight. I think he has made a little mistake there. I am sure that the mistake is just as glaring as that which he and the National Party will find in Queensland and northern New South Wales in terms of their approach to the sugar industry in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill, which was originally initiated at the request of the sugar industry itself, provides for an amendment to the maximum rate of levy which is currently set under section 7 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. This Bill increases the maximum rate of levy from 10c per tonne to some 15c per tonne of sugarcane. The Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 imposes on sugarcane produced in Australia and accepted for processing at a sugar mill a levy to fund the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is based, as I have said, on a recommendation by the raw sugar industry bodies. It will allow for future increases in the sugarcane levy rate above 10c per tonne. These levy rates are set by regulation following consultations between the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and, importantly, the sugar industry organisations. It is the raw sugar industry itself that has requested that the sugarcane levy be set at some 14c for 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sugar Research and Development Corporation oversees research and development for the industry. It is a mark of the maturity of this greatly valued Australian industry that it has taken the initiative to increase through this levy the funds available for research and development. That should be a source of concern to those National Party members opposite who think that they have some special `in' with our primary industries sector. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only recently we had representatives from the dairy industry in the Caucus primary industries committee room speaking in glowing terms about the Government's commendable and consultative approach to the changes to that industry. My recent experience with New South Wales Canegrowers, following a meeting in Grafton with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, points to a similar mutually satisfactory outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy of this Labor Government has been to encourage increased contributions by primary industry for rural research. The Government made a commitment to continue matching expenditure of approved industry levies on a dollar for dollar basis. This was reaffirmed in the May 1989 Government statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research, Innovation and Competitiveness</EMPHASIS>. These are three words which never would have cause to slip through the lips of the National Party members whom I see in my part of the country. Most likely one will hear words that amount to their saying one thing and doing exactly another. One reads things such as `Nats call for sugar tariff rate freeze', and then one will hear the Liberal bosses saying, `We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000'&mdash;`we' meaning the Opposition at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the credibility? Do the National Party mouthpieces in the bush think the politically astute primary producers never tune into the national media or read newspapers other than their local weeklies? Who are they trying to kid on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally recognised that research and development in the sugar industry is underfunded at present when compared with research and development efforts in other rural industries. Currently, about 0.17 per cent of gross value of production has been matched in the sugar industry when compared with an estimated 0.5 per cent in the wool, wheat, meat and oilseed industries. The Commonwealth is committed to match the expenditure of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation dollar for dollar, up to a limit of some 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of leviable sugarcane. The current maximum levy represents some 0.29 per cent of the gross value of production in 1991-92. Certainly, the Commonwealth's estimated maximum contribution for 1992-93 at 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production would be some $3.15m, equivalent to a levy of 0.126c per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 is part of this Government's commitment to listening to the needs of primary industries such as the sugar industry. The industry in my area, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, is a small or a modest industry on a national basis. However, it does contribute substantially to the economy of the north coast. It has seen crises before. In the late 1970s it went through a crisis in which the refining giant CSR withdrew from the New South Wales industry. The industry faced up to that crisis on a number of fronts. Through the cooperative, it was able to raise sufficient finance and, in cooperation with venture finance or a 50 per cent equity coming from Manildra Stockfeeds Group, it was able to establish its own refinery and go on from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that a substantial part of that finance that kept the north coast industry on its feet came from the State Labor Government, which continues the role that Labor governments have played in all our primary industries, not just the dairy industry and the sugar industry, in supporting those industries and keeping them viable. So much through history do we see that the real decisions, the real support, have come from Labor governments&mdash;both State and Federal. This is in stark contrast to the performance of some National Party members who toured through my electorate recently. I did say, rather tongue in cheek, that I was somewhat privileged to have them in my electorate recently, and I will say that again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as likely, though, the farmers are listening very clearly to the fact that a lot of those taxes do not impact upon the farms at present. As a matter of fact, as has already been pointed out, things such as the removal of the wholesale sales tax, as espoused and embraced by the coalition, is simply a policy which this Government is already following. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to payroll tax, unless the farmers pay themselves exorbitant wages, which we all know they do not, they are not going to be paying payroll tax. Mention has been made of the fuel levy. As the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), who is a cane farmer, quite rightly pointed out&mdash;indeed, I think even the National Party members recognise this, even if they are not farmers&mdash;diesel fuel is the fuel that is used to drive the primary industries of Australia, and there is no tax paid on that by the farmers. Again, we have the mouthing off from those opposite of the grab bag of benefits that will come from the Fightback package when they are not there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I fear, which canefarmers in particular have mentioned to me, is the removal of the training guarantee levy. It has received a lot of publicity in other areas and many other sections of industry have commented on it. Even the canefarmers have benefited, are benefiting and will benefit from the training guarantee charge. I compliment in very strong terms the canefarmers in my electorate. I urge the House to take note of this matter. The industry on the north coast is to be commended for the fact that it is running training courses for farmers in the safe and proper use and handling of chemicals. At this stage some 300 farmers and farm workers have gone through that course to ensure that the handling of chemicals is done in a proper and safe manner. All those things are put at threat by the removal of a training guarantee charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courses that the industry has been running are at the forefront of those offered by some of the primary industries in Australia. The people in the industry recognised that there was a need to lift their act in this area and they have responded in the appropriate and proper manner. I know that other industries are looking at the sorts of courses that have been offered around the north coast to take up this initiative. I compliment the New South Wales Canegrowers and the sugar industry for their role in leading the charge of ensuring that their work force is trained, capable and working in safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is all part of recognising that both safety and industrial relations are part of the rights of workers in the industry, on farms and within the sugar refineries and mills. The industrial relations proposal that comes from the GST package will put the stability and the progress of that industry at risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly! Why would they bother when they know that the Nationals have been politically castrated by the Liberal Party with its negligible tariff protection mates? I feel privileged that members of the National Party came to my electorate. They got a shock. Anyone who had lived in Richmond while the Doug Anthonys and Charles Blunts were the elected members would know what I mean. Not only did they not get out and talk productively at all with the primary producers about the need for research and development or other industry changes; it would seem they never talked to anyone at all. Constantly, as I move about my electorate talking to the constituents, I am told the same thing: `We never saw those fellows up there in the electorate at all'. I would say&mdash;and my electorate would certainly agree&mdash;that enough is enough. It is a bit of an insult&mdash;or is it just a tasteless joke?&mdash;that the National Party has preselected a third generation of its absentee landlords to contest the seat of Richmond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 responds to a request. We cannot respond to a request unless we are listening, and listening is not something many people have come to expect from the coalition. The only things the National Party seems to hear these days are the sweet nothings&mdash;and I mean nothings&mdash;offered by the Liberal Party. The Leader of the National Party has been running around my electorate, rare as that is, saying that the Government intends to eliminate sugar tariffs by 1998. As the Minister for Primary Industries stated in this House on 27 May in response to a question I raised, there will be no further adjustments to the rate of tariffs post 1 July, and the level already announced will remain until consultations have been carried out with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has not been driven by the Industry Commission report. Representatives of the dairy industry came to the Caucus primary industries committee recently and were more than happy with the constructive consultations that took place there. Those in the sugar industry, including the New South Wales canegrowers, are getting a lot of satisfaction out of that dairy industry response. They know that this Government does listen. They have proof of it. They can speak to the dairy industry representatives. They do not need to be convinced by this Government. They have no reason to doubt this Government. They know, however, that they have a lot of reasons to doubt a coalition whose Leader says, `We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other aspects that were mentioned in this debate this morning went to the heart of some of the other reforms which might be needed, including the anti-dumping and cabotage provisions with regard to coastal transport. If those opposite look through their own proposals on anti-dumping, they will realise that they are nowhere near as good as those the Government already has in place. They are offering a second-rate change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ongoing reform of the waterfront has been beneficial. The figures are there. Those opposite can see them, but for some reason or other with their blinkered response they seem to wish to ignore them. The industry itself has made tremendous gains. I compliment Senator Bob Collins on his involvement in it when he was the Minister for Shipping and Aviation and on the changes that I know have been welcomed by the industries that are affected by coastal transport and by the people whose jobs depend on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is the real relevance to and benefits gained by primary producers across Australia by being primary producers. All that is wiped out with a package such as Fightback. They no longer get the recognition that the economy and governments give them for being primary producers. They have to compete on an equal footing with other industries. They do not get the protection they deserve because of the unique position they occupy in producing things for this economy. Having to forward $50,000 or $60,000 to the Government every year before they actually pay themselves will be an impost that I do not think they will be able to afford and that I know they will not take on board. The farmers in my area know that they have a lot of reasons to doubt a coalition whose Leader has said that he will eliminate tariffs. They know that a vote for the National Party is simply a vote for the Liberal Party in Federal elections. There are no two-way communications there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning now to the legislation before the House, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. As is well-known by now by all members of the House, the Bill increases the maximum rate of the levy for research and development from the sugar industry from 10c to 15c per tonne. The investment by the various commodities into research and development is critical to their long term future. That hardly needs to be stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But despite the importance of innovation in rural industries, I very much fear that there has been little systematic effort to forge a genuine community of interest across the agricultural sector. Nor has there been a sustained effort to coordinate the sector's various resources and capabilities to enhance its long term prospects. This, for instance, is one of the reasons why the CSIRO has recently embarked upon a full scale review of its relationships with the rural research community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, I should add, is a review which will prove significant in addressing a number of the concerns I will shortly touch upon. It is a review process that the Parliament ought to endorse, as it not only reflects on CSIRO's seemingly limitless energy in trying to get its various research priorities on track, but it also represents an effort to ensure that the rural community gets everything it can out of its contributions to research and development and the existing rural research infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If nothing else, events continue to demonstrate that the fate of the industry cannot be pinned on periodic surges in international price for raw product alone. The rural sector must work harder on the domestic front to hone its resources and develop its capacities. Australia's agricultural capacity, however, is more than just a measure of raw commodity production volumes; it is a reflection of the chain of influences which affect the efficiency and quality of production and determine the ability of the primary sector to expand its share of the global market. Importantly, such influences include: the resources which make for innovation in agriculture, particularly the educational base to the rural community; the levels of activity within the organisational structure of the State and Commonwealth rural research effort; the orientation of the major funding bodies such as the rural research corporations; and the cost structures and other impediments to capitalising on the commercial returns from rural research and development projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is upon the effective coordination of these influences that the innovative capacity of the agricultural sector largely hinges. At the moment, there is little by way of a coordinated attack on each of these concerns. For example, the debate over the rural sector's levels of educational achievement and access to educational resources has even wider implications than first appears. The issue bears directly on the receptiveness of the next generation of farmers to the increasing opportunities provided by developments in technology and business management strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until such time as innovation in agriculture is driven by community demand and is more widely appreciated for the long term advantages it yields, rural research and development resources will remain under-utilised or poorly deployed. Importantly, changes of this order are critical to the approach of the rural research corporations to their research funding strategies. This, in turn, has a profound impact on the type and quality of research pursued in the longer term interest of the research sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of the rural community's demand for longer term strategic research, the rural corporations are shunted into accountability practices that can only be tested against short term goals. That is to say, research grants are increasingly evaluated against their capacity to realise immediate returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a function of corporatisation and conservative risk management strategies; it is a function of a body which largely reflects the interests and climate of opinion in the community that it serves. This process has inevitably distanced rural research corporations from the research agencies which undertake research and on whose expertise agriculture heavily depends. As a consequence there is little effective coordination between grants and research agencies, despite their interdependence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now only an emerging effort by commodity based rural research corporations to fund cooperatively research with widespread application. I know, for instance, that some efforts are being made by such rural research organisations as the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation to more effectively structure its programs. The Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation is undertaking to address national and regional research concerns. It is seeking to organise programs on a horizontal basis which allow for cooperation between a variety of related funding bodies and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an especially important development as it heralds an awakening that some research activities are multipurpose and have implications for a number of commodity groups. Accordingly, they must be sustained by across the board funding mechanisms rather than having their fate tied to one commodity corporation alone. I think some of the difficulties we have had keeping up CSIRO's screw-worm fly biological control countermeasures could have been overcome if we adopted this approach more so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation might have achieved much by way of innovative restructuring of programs, others have not been as successful or as enthusiastic. I believe it is critical that the rural research organisations embark upon careful planning exercises with CSIRO, not just to ensure that the organisation's own research base is stabilised and the correct balance of programs is maintained, but that the various commodity groups are able to exploit more effectively CSIRO's expertise over time. There are no universally accepted guidelines as to the balance between longer and shorter term grants that the corporations feel obliged to undertake, despite the importance of such a balance to their continuing access to high quality research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, research agencies and particular research program managers are not regularly taken into the confidence of the corporations as to their business plans and are unable to structure their research programs with regard to projected demand. What degree of consultation and planning, for instance, has been undertaken in respect of present and pending falls in research funding flowing from the decline in commodity prices? External funding for grains, meat and wool research has all been wound back but no attention has been given to its effect on core research capabilities. In circumstances such as these, it is imperative that funding and research agencies jointly formulate priorities and work pro-actively to shield vital resources which have been built up over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the challenges are even greater than this. I still believe that there is vast room for improvement in the relations between research agencies at the State and Federal levels and the corporations. In particular, the brittle nature of the State-based research capabilities requires dramatic action by way of added coordination. While aggregate Federal funding has at least reached some stability, State-based support for research is threatened. As the key sources of funding, State governments' cuts to research and research infrastructure threaten the nation's agricultural capacity more directly than any other concerns. Yet here, too, there is a vacuum in respect of initiatives to ensure that core regional and national rural research needs are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cuts might be unavoidable and reorganisation and redeployment of human and physical resources might be necessary, but they must be managed and coordinated in the longer term interests of the rural sector. To be sure, such a blueprint might well risk some States free-riding on others or the Commonwealth, but it is necessary to hope that some maturity of understanding will prevail when the longer term interest of a key industry sector is at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural research needs to be pursued on more regional lines. It needs to be structured so the various commodity groups are able to pursue programs in their common interests. It needs to be pursued with a closer eye to keeping alive the research resources which have taken many decades to build up. This last point is no idle or passing comment. Australia is a small nation with regard to the spread of specialised research expertise. Once we lose a body of expertise it is gone for good, or it will be mightily difficult either to resurrect it or to re-establish it at some unspecified time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of these difficulties, and there are others, it is difficult to contend that Australia's agricultural industries are at all well-placed to build their competitiveness beyond keeping their fingers crossed for sustained falls in exchange, interest and inflation rates. Governments, nevertheless, can help in filling the policy vacuum and driving change. In this respect, I would recommend to the House the CSIRO's recent horticultural review report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Horticulture in Focus</EMPHASIS>. There, as elsewhere in the CSIRO, there is evidence that there is not as yet any substantive organisational framework in place in respect of the relationships between funding bodies, research agencies and user groups which will ensure that commodity groups are able to capture the optimal returns possible from research activities. Consider the following quote from the CSIRO report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Declining State government allocations towards research for rural industries, the need for close cooperation between scientists working at the strategic end of the research spectrum with those adapting the new technology for industry use and the need for industry involvement at the planning stage emphasise the need for a collaborative approach towards the planning and implementation of research on a national basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter of the coordination of the rural research effort ought rightly to take precedence at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and should be subject to closer analysis by the Prime Minister's Science and Technology Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Premiers Conference might lay down some working principles for cooperation, the Science and Technology Council alone provides the forum for building constructive relationships across the rural research effort. If the existing science and technology administrative machinery is to prove its mettle, here is its chance. This is a matter which was raised in the editorial of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Search</EMPHASIS>, the journal of the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science&mdash;ANZAAS&mdash;in last December's issue. I commend it to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to appreciate that the issue of the national benefits of rural research is not one of measuring the outcomes in a technical manner of particular R&amp;D activities. Having a lot of good agricultural science around might make us feel good but it is not going to affect the important economic and commercial issues facing the nation or the rural industry. The various R&amp;D programs must be geared to marketing, they must be geared to controlling quality, and they must be driven from planting to the end market by the expectations of consumers. This is the only way in which the rural research sector can derive solid, long term benefits from its very significant contributions to its own R&amp;D capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that everyone in the industry has to work together and establish an even more unified chain of activity from production through to final distribution. Every player or stakeholder must have an acute appreciation of the needs of the wider process which he or she is part of. This is what I mean about closer coordination. The rural research sector is full of bit players concerned with their own immediate interests. We need a culture of rural research which is in tune with the long term development of the relevant markets. It is vital that I add that this perspective must be underpinned by greater efforts by government to strip away the price and costs and other structural impediments which stand in the way of further processing of rural commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not failed to develop value added processing based industries because it is dumb and needs to become clever; it has failed to do so because there has been no economic incentive to deploy resources into this undeveloped sector. We have not seized opportunities in advanced commodity processing because the commercial impediments and structural disincentives have been so powerful that no-one has dared to go into this end of the market. Have a look at every choke point on the processing chain, from transportation to indirect taxes to wage costs and other input fees and charges. At every point we are internationally uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government is serious about trying to build up a more progressive and export oriented rural sector, it might get down to creating the economic environment which fires these processes. It does no good blaming the industry for its myopia or blindness. It does no good trying to bribe industry groups to commit resources to processing activities of specific types; we have to create the overall commercial climate which drives the whole industry towards advanced processing and manufacturing of commodities. Importantly, it is also necessary to realise that this commercial climate feeds back into the research and development base. It brings new life to it; it attracts new resources and infrastructure; and it builds on all those relationships I mentioned earlier because it demonstrates that the market, when it can work, places value on intellectual inputs and knowledge and planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this regard, it is also worth noting that a stronger emphasis must be placed on rural research skills and education. The key function of government is to provide for skills development and research training opportunities. This should be pursued on the basis of providing even more extensive opportunities for industry involvement. Currently, the agricultural sector lacks a beacon for training and research. It lack institutional vehicles for expressing its capabilities and communicating its future, especially in the secondary school network. There are improvements in the post-secondary school and TAFE systems, but we have a long way to go yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an important way, the agriculture sector is still to take its own future in its hands. Creative administrative solutions to the problems as outlined might yield some returns, but substantive change will not grip until there is a community of views across the agricultural sector as to the role of innovation and change. Though it shoulders unfair burdens relative to other industries in the economy, the agricultural sector cannot afford to fall into despair or neglect the struggle to consolidate its future. That is a struggle which will be won or lost not by bureaucrats or administrators but by those who are now at work within Australia's primary industries. It is a struggle which must be complemented in practical ways by the government of the day, and critically so with regard to freeing up economic and investment resources across the sector, especially by breaking through the cost and structural barriers which stand in the way of rural industries' capacities to add further still to the national benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate at the outset that I appreciate the opportunity of joining in this debate with my colleagues the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), all of whom have a very keen interest in the industry and the future of the industry&mdash;not just in their electorates, but in northern New South Wales and the eastern coastline of Queensland. I will be restricting my comments specifically to research within the sugar industry, which is what the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with some degree of interest to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), in relation to research in a general sense. I think a lot of what he said was correct and quite interesting. Research is something that can be better put forward by more cooperation between governments at all levels and the rural sector. When we talk about cooperation between governments at all levels and the rural sector, and when we talk about the sugar industry, we get back to the situation that has existed for almost 80 years now, where the sugar industry was regarded as almost a closed industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travelled through my area, particularly those parts related to the sugar industry, with the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, who contributed so much to the industry, and I listened to him advise&mdash;not cajole, but advise&mdash;the sugar industry ad nauseam to look at a broader approach to research within the industry. At that time it did not even contribute to, or seek Federal funding for, research within the industry. Research was done solely through&mdash;and I emphasise the words `solely through'&mdash;industry contribution. Whilst that was not an insignificant contribution to research in the sugar industry, it took almost five years for the Federal Government to convince those at an executive level in the sugar industry in Queensland to get involved at a Federal level and seek Federal support for research. That is borne out by the fact that the principal Act was only introduced in 1987. That was another initiative of this Government, in cooperation with the sugar industry, by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). One could say that we are now looking at an upgrading or an increase in research from the original Act some five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I am fortunate that I am able to speak on this Bill, having had some hands-on experience within the sugar industry. It is not trite to say that for two years I was Chairman of the Mossman Local Sugar Cane Prices Board. I have appeared as an advocate before the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board. My experience within the industry&mdash;whilst certainly not at the grower level, but more at the legislative or regulatory level&mdash;is such that I believe I have a very good knowledge of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the more recent history of the industry&mdash;I do not intend to go back over the 80 years I have already referred to&mdash;we see that it has had its ups and downs, as do most rural or primary industries. If we look at the cyclical nature of the industry, we can understand the difficulty this industry faces. When I came to this Parliament, it was the most predominant and major industry in my electorate. It has been well overtaken by tourism, but it is no less significant. I follow the fortunes of the industry with a great deal of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research into the sugar industry will be boosted by the timely increase in the levy, which was sought by the industry itself. I hope that the industry places a higher emphasis on research within the very wet areas of sugarcane production in Queensland; an area that I believe has been overlooked in the past, and an area that will become more important as rural land on the eastern seaboard becomes even more scarce through urban and other forms of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this Bill. It is another initiative of this Government to support an industry which is extremely important to this nation. It is a continuation of our support for the industry over the years. If we comb very carefully through the record of this industry, we will find that, over the years, the only government that has given substantial direct support to the Australian sugar industry has been the Labor Government. It puts into place the myth that exists in some areas of this country&mdash;a myth which is quickly disappearing&mdash;that the National Party is the saviour of those in the rural sector. If we ask the people who have been involved in the sugar industry for many years where their support has come from in the last decade, we will get only one answer: the government of the day has been the only government at a Federal level to support the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by saying that I am extremely pleased that the Federal Government is cooperating comprehensively with the State Government in the future adjustment of the sugar industry. The relationship between the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is extremely good, and that can only be for the betterment of the industry, not just in the short term, but in the long term as well. The sugar industry is critical, not just to north Queensland, but to the nation as a whole as a major export earner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some comments made by those opposite about the lack of interest of this Government in the sugar industry. I have already outlined that that is not the case. The more recent debate on the reduction of tariffs within the industry is a glowing example&mdash;a patently clear example&mdash;of where the best interests of the sugar farmers of this nation lie in the future. Not only did we have the two National Party senators running out of control around Queensland&mdash;knowing little or nothing of the sugar industry, and clearly showing that through their ignorance and totally irresponsible and irrelevant statements&mdash;but we now have members of the major party in the coalition, the Liberal Party, also indicating in sugar growing areas in far north Queensland that the reduction of tariff by this Government is too severe and too fast. However, when one compares that with what we are going to see if, in the unlikely event, those opposite take the treasury bench, it will not be just a reduction in the tariff level, but a complete eradication of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, I am very pleased to contribute to today's debate on this legislation. It is a substantiation of the original Bill which was introduced by this Government in 1987. I support the current legislation and the future increase in levies and Commonwealth contribution for research into what is, as I have said over and again, a very important industry for this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As previous speakers have informed the House, this legislation is associated with increasing the research and development levy for the sugar industry from 10c to 15c a tonne. That, we are advised, is a matter that has the support of the industry. When we look at some of the information which, for instance, points out that presently the sugar industry is spending about 0.17 per cent of gross value of production as compared with the wool, meat, wheat and oilseed industries which spend 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, and when the Government is prepared to agree to a dollar for dollar subsidy to a value of 0.5 per cent of gross value of production, there is obviously a need for the industry to put more into the area of research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any dispute in this Parliament that research and development expenditure is a necessity and is something which, provided it is properly managed, should be encouraged at all times. This is the age of technology; this is the age of reform. Sugar growers, wheat growers and meat producers should be finding ways of investing in the improvement of their industry. I want to underline the words `development' and `improvement' because frequently when we talk about research we immediately turn our minds to science. There is no reason to ignore the efforts of our scientists today and, in particular, the wonderful organisation we call CSIRO. On so many occasions their efforts benefit many Australians. </PARA>

Apparently the gene has been inserted into the plant so it can better resist climatic conditions such as coldness, et cetera. It seems to me that plants are about to get a dose of cod liver oil. It is interesting to see that science is going down this road and being successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt at this point and previous to the conclusion of my speech most members of parliament, most sugarcane growers and others would be presuming that the welfare of their industry was best served by spending this money in the scientific arena. Whilst I would say it would always be appropriate to spend some of the money in that arena, I thought today I might put the case as to why some of these funds might be directed to other areas. The welfare of an industry is well recognised today in its capacity to not only increase productivity&mdash;for instance, of a sugarcane plant&mdash;but also improve the handling of the material and the harvesting. In my living memory, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</EMPHASIS> sugarcane was harvested by hand. One wonders how competitive we would be today if we had to revert to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research and development have created machines that do that work and do it very successfully. Notwithstanding that we do not cut cane with a machete and the brawn and muscle of individuals any more, the role of individual workers is still a very significant aspect of the efficiency of the sugar industry. Similarly, the role of government is very significant to the competitiveness of the sugar industry. I will not be the first speaker in this debate to mention some of the coalition's policies as recorded in its Fightback document. Whereas others have tried to insert this as an opportunity to get at us, I want to point out under the heading of research and development why there is good reason for these industries to ask themselves&mdash;and to spend some of this money&mdash;where they would benefit and be made more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 90-plus per cent of the sugar we grow is exported. I often remind people that in the export market only three questions are ever asked: How good? How soon? How much? It is a fact of life that foreign importers are not too worried about how things are going back here in Australia. They are not too worried about how our industrial relations system works or how we tax our producers. They just want to know how good, how soon and how much. Unfortunately, Australians quite frequently have great difficulty answering those questions in the proper fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that industries such as the sugar industry said to themselves, `Notwithstanding the commitment we have to research and development in the scientific arena, what else is needed to make our industry more competitive and, therefore, to expand and to make sure that in tough times there is a better return to the individual at the end of the chain, the one we all talk about but frequently help very little&mdash;the person who grows the product?'. Whilst I do not have the job of representing anybody who grows sugar, I certainly represent the largest group of farmers to be found in any electorate in Australia. Those people face similar problems to those in the sugar industry in that they have to export onto these markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the problems that are being confronted by the sugar industry in the way this country is run today?  We have a process, entrenched in the laws of this Parliament, called centralised wage fixing. The issue of wages is very sensitive. Most politicians, myself included, are anxious to see the welfare of the wage earner improved; but I for one, unlike some others, know that we improve the welfare of a worker only when we give him a wage increase in real terms&mdash;in other words, a little above what inflation is taking away. I might add: a little above what inflation and the tax system&mdash;bracket creep, the result of inflation&mdash;take away. That is when a worker benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear remarks about a minimum wage of about $3 an hour in America. We are not reminded that people can buy a pair of good quality jeans for $US35. So what is a fair wage? A fair wage is something that allows somebody to keep a family at local cost of living in a reasonable circumstance. It has nothing to do with how much money one gets. Frequently we find in Australia that the more money one gets the more in percentage terms the tax man gets and the less one has to keep one's family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having had the New Zealand situation poked down my throat in this Parliament for the past six months, the current silence of the Government on New Zealand is very noticeable, and we know why. New Zealand, which has undertaken many of the reforms that are proposed in the Fightback document, has just achieved an $80m current account surplus&mdash;not trade, not export of manufactured goods. It is the first current account surplus for New Zealand in 20 years. It seems that something over there is working. But it is better than that. In regard to the welfare of employees, I got the High Commission to fax me an extract from its statistical return which advises us that for the last quarter, under these apparently draconian measures&mdash;as the Government and the trade union movement would have us believe&mdash;real wages in New Zealand have gone up by 1.3 per cent. That compares with a figure in Australia for the 12 months to December 1991 of plus 0.5 per cent&mdash;less than half; and for the nine months to December 1991, minus one per cent. We have not really delivered much for the workers. There might be something for the workers in what the New Zealanders are on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect of this relating to the workers in the sugar industry. Notwithstanding that a farmer has to pay something like $300,000 for a piece of machinery simply to harvest the crop, he then has to put it into a little train or a truck and send it off to a sugar mill. This massive sugar mill represents a huge capital investment and ideally should operate 24 hours a day. Some might do so; others do not, as with the canning factories and all the other consumers of sugar. They do not operate because our centralised wage fixing system demands that an employee working the first hour on the second shift of the day has to be paid 1 1/2 times the wages of the person who worked the previous shift. We call it shift penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union movement will tell us that it has achieved that benefit for the workers. But driving around Australia through industrial areas, past sugar mills and all sorts of places, in most cases we find that they are closed during those working hours. When the employers sit down and estimate the cost of that capital sitting idle against this imposition of higher wages, they come down on the side of locking the gate. That is a great victory for the workers. Those who should be working on the second shift and the third shift are not working at all. They are not missing out on half the wages of their colleagues as a penalty rate, they are missing out on the grand total. They get nothing. The sugar industry needs its mills and those people who consume its product in turning fruit and other items into canned products which can be marketed in many Asian areas in particular to operate around the clock. It needs the Bundaberg distillery to operate around the clock and to be highly efficient for every one of those hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that sugar is invariably associated with heat. The sugar is extracted from the juices using a large amount of heat and more heat is used in cooking up the brew to make the rum. All these heating processes are in relatively isolated areas, and in most cases natural gas cannot be used because a pipe does not go there. So what do they use? Automotive distillate. What does this Government do to automotive distillate? It puts 26c a litre tax on it. If the researchers who will spend the money this Parliament is proposing to vote to them today were to do some research, it would take them very little time to find that our industry would be much more efficient and would be able to expand and create jobs at every level if we just got that tax monkey off its back. Fightback proposes just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the cost of this tax involved in the workers driving out to the sugarcane farms to drive the tractors will be reduced. The costs of the farmer will be reduced in the same way because, notwithstanding that the diesel he puts into the sugarcane harvester is free of that tax, the fuel on the train that takes his cane away, or the fuel in his car that he drives into town to negotiate his next loan with the bank, is not tax free. It is not free on any of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He can buy a four-wheel drive that is free of tax. But they are hugely expensive and he probably does not need a four-wheel drive. Under Fightback he can buy a simple little ute, a motor bike or a sedan, provided that it is for the use of his business, and he will pay no sales tax and no GST. What is more, when the sugar mill sends him the cheque for his grain crop, it will send him an amount plus 15 per cent. In his cheque he will receive an extra 15 per cent for his sugarcane. He will bank it&mdash;and the bank manager will be pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will sit on it for at least a couple of months, at which point he will be able to deduct from that amount of money any tax that he has paid&mdash;any GST tax that he has paid&mdash;on the inputs to his business, be it that new ute or tractor, fuel, fertiliser and so on. He could deduct all of that and send the tax man only what was left over. Of course, that will improve his efficiency, because it avoids a thing called `cascading'. This is what I want the researchers to spend some of this money on. I want them to go into the cascading effect on an industry such as sugar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a thing called payroll tax. We have heard&mdash;I think it was the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) who told us&mdash;that sugarcane growers do not pay payroll tax. Not much! The cascade effect guarantees that because they pay tax on everything that they buy. What do they think the fertiliser manufacturer pays? He pays payroll tax. What does the honourable member for Hinkler think the transport companies pay? What does he think the sugar mills pay? What do those opposite think all of these other firms that they rely on for services and goods do? They all pay payroll tax and they build it into their prices, and it flows down to the next one and they pay it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The generous body called the Industrial Relations Commission then gives its workers another $10, of which the tax man immediately takes $5. But the payroll tax goes up on the $10. It is driving people into the ground; it is $6,000m. The backs of sugar growers carrying these cascade burdens are probably more bent than those blokes who used to cut the cane. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trucks carry fuel that is burnt at Bundaberg Rum or at the various crushing mills. That fuel is being transported by road in a truck and is taxed. The sales tax on the prime mover is costing the owner-driver $900 a month in lease payments and the tax on the fuel he consumes to deliver the fuel is costing him another $2,500 a month. Do those opposite think he says, `Well, I know life is tough for the sugar growers. I'll absorb those taxes. I won't pass them on'. Of course he passes them on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the misfortune of the sugar grower as an exporter is that he does not write it on the bottom of the docket. He does not say, `To my labour and to my profit and to taxes'&mdash;which are about 30 per cent of his operating revenue. So how does the sugar company get that tax back? It cannot. It is just there. It is time that these researchers put some of this money into establishing that. They will have to find a pretty interesting gene to put into sugarcane to make it produce enough sugar to match what the Fightback policy will give to the workers, to match the growth that the Fightback policy will give to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As much as I am in favour of scientific research, there is a real need for the researchers to say, `Well, just hang off for a minute. Let's go and see which is the quickest way to get an immediate benefit for the sugar industry to make it more competitive out there in the world, to double the size of it'. Do honourable members know the answer that these researchers&mdash;these men of exact mind; these scientists&mdash;will come up with? Two words: `Vote Liberal'; `Vote National'. That is all that they have to recommend; the rest will happen. It is a very interesting area of research to benefit workers and industry but, most importantly, to benefit Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this Government has generated growth in this country&mdash;and it has borrowed every penny of it. Now, of course, we are paying 25 per cent of the value of all exports, sugar included, to service those debts. That has happened only twice in the history of this country: during the 1930s Depression and during the 1890s depression. And others say that we have not had a depression!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that those researchers will read my speech.

The reluctance also of the speakers from the Opposition to get into the real issues facing the sugar industry has been noted in this debate. Later I will cover that a bit further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992 is to increase the maximum rate of the levy on sugar to 15c a tonne. The levy is paid on sugar which is produced in Australia and which is accepted for processing at sugar mills. At present the maximum rate that the levy can be raised to is 10c a tonne. Regulations to raise the levy from 6c a tonne to 10c a tonne were passed recently as an interim measure pending the passing of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill is the result of recommendations from the Australian raw sugar industry. The request has come from the Australian Cane Growers Council, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Australian Sugar Milling Council. The industry levy provides funds for the activities of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation. The request for this increase demonstrates the industry's commitment to research and its desire to enhance the competitiveness of the sugar industry, both through exports and on the domestic market through this Commonwealth scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to matching the Sugar Research and Development Corporation on a dollar for dollar basis, up to the limit of half a per cent of the gross value of production of sugar which has had that levy paid. The increased rate of levy is in accord with the Federal Government's policy for rural research and development. This policy encourages increased contributions by primary industry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is generally recognised that the research and development in the sugar industry at present is inadequately funded compared with research and development programs in other rural industries. At present, about 0.17 per cent of GVP is matched in the sugar industry, compared with about half a per cent in wool, wheat, meat and oil seed industries, or about one-third of the amount in those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry is one of Australia's very important agricultural industries. It ranks as Australia's third most valuable export crop, coming behind wheat and cotton. Over three-quarters of the production is exported. More than 90 per cent of total Australian production of sugar comes from Queensland, with the remainder coming from the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. Although, in an Australian context, New South Wales is the smaller producer, the sugar industry is nonetheless a very important industry in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales and in my electorate of Page. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales sugarcane is grown by about 550 growers in the three river valleys of the Tweed, Richmond and Clarence. Cane production is not irrigated any differently to many areas of Queensland, and flood mitigation and drainage are significant production costs. In New South Wales cane is harvested from about 18 months to two years of growth; in Queensland it is harvested after about 15 months of growth. In 1991 approximately 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, from 1.45 million tonnes of sugarcane, was produced in New South Wales. This equates to about 7 per cent of Australia's raw sugar production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Sugar Milling Cooperative, to which all New South Wales growers belong, owns and operates the three mills at Condong, Broadwater and Harwood. A refinery with a capacity to produce 250,000 tonnes of refined sugar is located at Harwood. Raw sugar from the three mills is sold to the Harwood refinery, and currently all refined sugar is sold on the domestic market. It is worth noting that all domestic sugar from New South Wales is sold on the domestic market. The New South Wales industry is encouraging growers to expand cane production over the next 10 years by about 40 per cent in order to utilise that excess of refined sugar capacity. In 1991 about 40,000 tonnes of raw sugar was purchased for refining at Harwood from the Queensland Sugar Corporation to fulfil contracts that the New South Wales industry had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that growing conditions have been good for the current season, and sugar production is expected to reach 190,000 tonnes in 1992. That is due to seasonal conditions, good rainfall and generally advantageous conditions for the sugar industry on the north coast of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international outlook for sugar is that sugar prices are expected to fall to US8c a pound in 1991-92, which is down from the average price of US9.3c last year and US13.9c a pound the previous year. Medium term prices should continue to be cyclical. The price cycle of the early 1990s is likely, however, to be shorter and shallower than the cycles of the 1980s. Prices are expected to be low over the next two to three years, followed by the cyclical increase to maybe 12c a pound in the middle of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World production is projected to increase at a slower rate than the growth in world consumption. By the middle of the decade, production is likely to rise as world prices rise. Consumption is currently low in Asia, at about 12 kilograms per person, and that is expected to be the main region of consumption growth through the 1990s, but it will be offset by a probable decline in consumption in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Import demand is expected to show little increase over the medium term. In Australia, cane production in 1991-92 is estimated to have declined 15 per cent from the 1990 season, mainly because of drought. The level will be 21.3 million tonnes, resulting in 3 million tonnes of sugar&mdash;a reduction of 0.4 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export returns are forecast to be down $639m in 1991-92, down by a level of $233m, which is a reflection of both the low production and the low prices. Returns to cane production are forecast to fall by 23 per cent in 1991-92 to $585m. Sugar production is forecast by ABARE at 3.4 million tonnes for 1992-93. Over the medium term, increases in sugar plantings are forecast to result in sugar production rising to around 4.5 million tonnes in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at those figures, we see that there is no doubt that the sugar industry has had a tough time in the last few years and will continue to have a tough time in the short term, mainly because of crook weather, low prices, corrupt markets&mdash;all of which make life difficult for sugar producers. These difficulties, which are reflected by those ABARE forecasts, mean that the Government needs to be able to consider industry needs for future policy. There needs to be cooperation between the Government and the industry in formulating responses, especially to the Industry Commission's report. The industry needs to respond to the Industry Commission's report in a way which sets out its plans for progression&mdash;progressing towards greater efficiency, productivity, competitiveness and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry can take hope from the comments of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) that he and the Government will not be driven by the Industry Commission report. The report will not be used by the Government as a benchmark or a blueprint. It is a document that needs to be considered. But, along with it and the consideration of it, responses of the industry also need to be taken into account. The just arguments that the industry puts forward on the Industry Commission report will be given the weight that they deserve by the Government. This is something that the Government will do, but the Opposition cannot and will not do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The schoolboy stuff that we get from over there! I am happy to say that I proposed to the committee of the Caucus of the Government today and it accepted, as the Cabinet subsequently accepted and then presented to Caucus, a revolutionary new policy for pay television in Australia. The basis of that policy is that the Government will seek to establish a new operator in the Australian media that is not owned or partly owned by either any of the existing operators, that is the existing free to air television companies, telecommunications carriers or large newspaper groups. In other words, Australia will have a new media entrant which has no shares in and owns no part of the old media areas of print, television or telecommunications. That will mean in the development of satellite pay television that the first four transponders on the satellite, which will be issued upon bidding, will find that there will be a pay TV operator in drama, film, sport, et cetera, which will be virtually a new entrant to the Australian media. As part of the policy, on transponders five and six there will be no equity restrictions. These will be available to the free to air television operators, the telecommunications companies, Telecom and Optus, any of the large newspaper groups and any other interested party, be it a supplier of drama or television or film product.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This presents a new and revolutionary competitive model in pay television; in the first instance, a new operator, independent of the existing multimedia arrangements and combinations in Australia, to provide to Australia and the Australian people four channels of pay television from the satellite which is available now and can be available to access 94 per cent of the population with existing technology and which will not be compromised by interests of the television networks or the telecommunications operators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, on transponders 5 and 6 there will be an opportunity for the people who want to advance the new technologies&mdash;cable, fibre optics, MDS and any of the other technologies&mdash;combined with the abilities and capital of the networks, the telecommunications companies or the film and television product suppliers. It seems that the Government will be able to offer Australians the best of both worlds: a new entrant to supply entertainment and sport on pay television while at the same time leaving open the technological opportunities and technological innovation of cable, MDS, fibre optics, and the rest.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be substantial benefits all round to the airlines concerned, to their passengers, to the nation through the greater capacity of our airlines to compete, and to the Government in regard to its Budget. The merger is a better outcome for the Government, as a seller, and for the airlines. That is because of the synergies or efficiencies that the merger will enable us to achieve. They have been put by the airlines and our advisers at well over $100m per annum. When capitalised, that adds several hundred million dollars to the value of the airlines. The combined airline will be much more efficient than each of the two on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, it is much more able to be competitive, much more able to provide competitive fares to its customers, and is also worth more to the Government in the sale process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the proposal to sell 100 per cent, rather than 49 per cent, of Qantas, I point out that 49 per cent would not have brought much return to the Budget because the recapitalisation requirement of the two airlines combined is in the order of $1.5 billion. Most of the revenue from a 49 per cent sale would have been needed to meet the Government's share of recapitalisation. The sale of 100 per cent avoids the need for the Government to fund any of that recapitalisation, so it provides us with a much better Budget outcome&mdash;well over $1 billion. Quite clearly, there are benefits all round, as I have said.</PARA>

In the face of those facts, we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that we are selling off the family silver.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, since that time we have had a deregulated domestic market. It is an open, contestable market. We have had a new entrant who, certainly, has failed; but another entrant is limbering up and is hoping to start shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation, we opened the market further to Air New Zealand by proposing a single Australasian aviation market, thus bringing more competition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation, we scrapped the single designation policy&mdash;which was the policy that you pursued all the time that you were in government&mdash;and brought in the possibility of other aviation operators from Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In One Nation, we also announced our intention to develop a multiple designation regime for Australasian carriers in the international market.

Of course, other people are not so stupid or so prepared to try to play politics; they are prepared to address the real issues. Let us look at what the Tasmanian tourism Minister, Peter Hodgman, had to say today on ABC radio in Hobart. He was asked about this matter and he said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that we have now got the proposed combining of Australian Airlines and Qantas gives us a direct international penetration into all international markets. I mean it's great news. And I think the prices should come down. . . </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the prices should come down. . . you'll pay international rates from Hobart in a one-stop shop ticket. And I mean it's very exciting prospects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not be absurd. Mr Speaker, there is a simple notion about. The assumption that if the superannuation guarantee levy is not paid there will be no cost whatsoever to employers is a false one because it would be paid otherwise as wages. That is not to say&mdash;and it will not be the case&mdash;that it will be paid to the exclusion of increases in wages, because both can be paid. As I indicated, we will need only to devote a third of the productivity available in the next few years to pay this increase in the course of the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met the ACTU last week and drew attention to the One Nation commitment to support for a continuing role for national wage cases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I add that in the One Nation statement we have the commitment from the ACTU for the first time for organised labour in this country ever to commit itself to a wages policy that will guarantee an inflation rate comparable with that of our trading partners. I said that, given the present information we had about inflation, earnings growth and output growth, there would appear to be room for a national wage increase and the SGC&mdash;the superannuation guarantee levy&mdash;in the course of 1992-93, consistent with our inflation target. However, I gave no commitment on the timing of the increase or the quantum of the increase. In fact, the ACTU has not yet formulated a claim and there have been no discussions with the Government on quantum or timing. I also mentioned Treasury evidence to the Senate which showed that, on even a modest forecast of productivity growth, the guarantee levy's implementation over the decade will equal, as I said a minute ago, only one-third of expected productivity gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a sensible development of superannuation, a sensible development of a retirement incomes policy for higher standards of living for the retired aged, particularly those who will join the retired aged population around 2010 and 2015, the baby boomers from beyond the Second World War, demographically doubling the number of retired aged persons in the community compared with today, there will need to be in place a retirement incomes system to meet it&mdash;not only to provide some relief from the burden on the Commonwealth Budget but also to provide a better standard of living; and, in so doing, provide a necessary and advantageous pool of national savings in the meantime.</PARA>

Mr Howard, who also had another meeting with APPM Chief Executive Bill Paisley and Public Relations officer Chris Oldfield in Canberra a month ago, told Parliament Mr Wade had briefed him on the company's position in the dispute and why it had behaved the way it had.</PARA>

Perhaps the honourable member for Kooyong will ask the Leader of the Opposition to tell us exactly how he left here in 1983 as an officer serving the Treasurer and came back in 1987 with $5m worth of assets, and how he has worked all sides of the streets throughout the portals of Sydney business to advance himself politically and commercially.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have often told the House that the Government has been acutely aware of education and training in this country. From 1983 to 1992 we have seen, in the primary instance, in the compulsory education system, the retention of young people in school rise from 30 per cent to nearly 80 per cent. This higher retention rate in schools has been met by a growth in places in tertiary institutions. We have added 50 per cent of the places to tertiary institutions, creating the equivalent of 120,000 extra places in universities&mdash;the equivalent of 12 campuses&mdash;in the period from 1987 to 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that revolutionary change, again in education participation and in tertiary education, which the Government presided over in the 1980s that has given Australia a chance to climb back up the ladder as a technological country, as a country with technological abilities, to be able to play its role in Australia. In the One Nation statement the Government also announced that it would be looking for a reformation of the TAFE system to better support vocational education so it can play its role with that other tier of education in Australia&mdash;the tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that we see that vocational education training is a very important part of our education system. We need a truly national system&mdash;a system of high quality and high status. That is why there is a commitment in One Nation to vastly improve the TAFE system. That is why the Commonwealth is offering to assume full responsibility for the funding and the administration of TAFE. The reforms are not options but imperatives.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question which is, as he said, on the issue of superannuation, a matter which the Leader of the Opposition referred to earlier in a question to the Prime Minister. It should first be pointed out that we have a most appalling scene in the Senate, where the Opposition is trying to lead a charge against a very important reform, a very important measure, which will bestow benefits on hundreds of thousands of Australian working men and women. The Opposition is trying to frustrate this initiative in the absence of any workable policy of its own. It is interested only in trying to destroy a measure which has been put forward by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the remarks by Mr Ian Salmon, the Managing Director of the AMP Society, in a speech he made yesterday on this topic, when he lamented the fact that the issue has become a political football here in Canberra and quoted with approval the observation of the Prime Minister, made a couple of days ago in relation to the position of the Opposition, about the `mindless obstructionism and vandalism of the Leader of the Opposition and his Party in this regard'. Mr Salmon went on to make this observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For weeks, Federal Parliament and the media have been ablaze with the controversy over Senator Graham Richardson. Did any of this benefit Australia in any way? I doubt it. Did it do anything to help our economic problems? No.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet day after day and question after question, we have seen the Opposition, led by this bankrupt&mdash;and I use the term metaphorically&mdash;Leader of the Opposition, trying to distract the attention of the Parliament away from these real issues. Mr Salmon went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what does not bear any argument is the pressing need for a universal system of superannuation: to provide an umbrella of protection over the nation; to provide much of the long term savings needed to develop the businesses of Australia . . . Such is the priority of this issue that you could very reasonably expect our political parties to themselves reach some form of consensus on how to prepare for the nation's future.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet in the absence of any workable alternative policy&mdash;indeed, the policy is so flawed that it has been sent off to an adviser who has already told the Opposition that it needs compulsion to make a superannuation scheme work&mdash;those opposite are simply trying to wreck, frustrate and delay the Government's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, they are not entirely alone in this endeavour; they have the Confederation of Australian Industry doing some of their dirty work.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. In fact, it disagrees with itself&mdash;as I will show the honourable member in a moment. The CAI, in conjunction with Westpac&mdash;and I really do wonder how long Westpac can continue to be a co-signatory to some of the surveys which are undertaken&mdash;put out a press release in March this year. In that press release it said, `Manufacturing at the bottom but no recovery yet'. Yet this press statement containing that assessment was over the top of a survey result which said that the outlook for general business conditions for the six months ahead had reached its highest level since the September quarter of 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than portraying the reality of the survey results, the CAI will go to any lengths to try to distort these matters, apparently for its own particular purposes and also in order to assist its comrades in arms over there. In December last year it said, `Disappointing results as recovery hopes stall'. Yet this press statement was on top of a survey result which actually showed that a significantly larger net balance of respondents expected output to increase over the next six months. And the list goes on and on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the wonder of them all is the most recent effort by the CAI in relation to the SGC. It put out a statement which said that 180,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. It talked about the additional costs which would be imposed upon industry, when, in fact, its own survey revealed that 90 per cent of the work force covered by this survey already had superannuation of 3 per cent or more. It also said that, overwhelmingly, these respondents were small businesses, which, in any event, for the next year under the SGC would have to comply only with their current obligations as regards the 3 per cent payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How this could have imposed such an additional expense on business that it would be required to lay off 180,000 people is not clear, until one realises the basis of this particular calculation. The survey found one respondent, with 1,200 employees, who said that even though 90 per cent of his current employees had 3 per cent or more superannuation cover, he was going to have to put off something like 35 employees as a result of the introduction of the SGC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this one employer with 1,200 employees, 90 per cent of whom are covered by the requirements of the levy in any event, then said that he would have to put off 35 employees. So what does the CAI do with this? It says, `Oh well, 35 per cent equals 2.9 per cent of the work force, and if you translated this over the entire economy, it adds up to 180,000 people losing their jobs'. This is a survey of one firm which the CAI is broadcasting around as a reason for supporting this case that there would be 180,000 people losing their jobs as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee levy. I would have thought that any self-respecting business, unless it were a total political zealot, would think twice about paying its subscriptions to the CAI ever again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, a day or two ago we had from the Opposition spokesman on shipping his usual rather churlish outburst that comes every couple of months on what is supposedly a fundamental failure in terms of the Government's program for waterfront reform. Unfortunately for him, the statistics do not bear him out; fortunately for the nation, they bear out the claims that we have been making as to the likely outcome of the waterfront reform process that has been put in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the waterfront authority, on stevedoring performance indicators as at March this year, these things are worth talking about. Firstly, the work force has gone down by 42 per cent since the beginning of the reform program in late 1989. It has gone from 8,900 to 5,100 employees and, when the program is completed at the end of this year, the work force will have been halved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, productivity has soared. In container terminals, productivity per employee, measured by the average number of standard containers handled per manned shift, increased by 100 per cent between 1989 and the end of 1991. Average crane handling rates rose by almost 60 per cent, from 12 containers per hour in 1989 to 18 or 19 by March this year. This is equal to or better than rates achieved at major overseas terminals such as Osaka in Japan, with an average rate of 17; Pusan in Korea, with an average rate of 19; and Tilbury in England, with an average rate of 18.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report it is interesting to examine the performance rate in New Zealand, because New Zealand is touted by the Opposition from time to time as the measure by which it wishes every economic performance in this country to be judged. The proposition is that it will introduce in Australia a similar system, an excellent one from its point of view. However, the report gives the average container rate achieved in Auckland in New Zealand as 18 containers per hour, which is equal to the Australia-wide average and well behind some of our major ports. For example, the rate in Sydney and Adelaide is 19, and in Fremantle it is 21.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the national accounts were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. We have brought on this matter of public importance to look more closely at and to analyse some of the results which came out of them. As is virtually always the case in these debates, I have absolutely no doubt that, as we look at some of the problems and, sure, recognise some of the good things in the Australian economy, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will get up and personally bag me on the basis that we are talking doom and gloom. That is always the Government's line. It is never prepared to look at the fundamentals and at what needs to be done to turn this country around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is absolutely certain about the future   economic path that this country is going to take is that we cannot have more of the same. This country cannot go on the way it has been going. When the Treasurer stands and runs his usual sort of personal abuse, I would like him to cast his mind back to a recent article in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 28 May 1992, which is headed `The Beaten Generation'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each day, 500 children join the 680,000 who have neither parent working.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought it was a very graphic description of the magnitude of the problem. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> mentions the fact that, in an average classroom of 30 students, five have parents who are either unemployed or outside the work force. This country is facing a national crisis. We have nearly one million people unemployed. When the figures came out yesterday, what did we get from the Government? We had its members oozing deception about the state of the Australian economy, and there was a smell of smugness and a sense of arrogance from them about their current economic policy. The Government's policy has failed and it is hurting literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, every day the Government says, `Look, things are fine; things are on track', it is putting off and deferring the inevitable changes that this country must make. Basically our view is: why let our country drift on for another three or five years and why do all the considerable damage that we will do to ourselves, rather than take the bull by the horns now and go for some fundamental reforms that we know will make the difference? Basically, the Government's line&mdash;and we will hear it all again in a moment from the Treasurer&mdash;is that things are working. We hear that every year from members opposite. If one goes back to the Budget in 1987, five years ago, one will see that the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said, `Tonight I can report that Australia is winning'. Then a month later he said, `This is the golden age of economic change'. In 1988 he said, `This is the one that brings home the bacon'. In 1990, when he was asked whether there was going to be a recession, he said, `I will not let there be a recession'. When he was elected Prime Minister, he said, `I am not going to tell lies any more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we had soothing words from the Treasurer, that we are on the growth plan for a sustainable, widely spread recovery. I honestly would like to believe that that were true. It would be great if we had come to grips with the basic problems facing this economy and if one could say honestly to people, `Yes, things are fixed; things are going to be better'. But the truth is that that is simply not there on the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Opposition saying this. The Government cannot get up and say, `You guys are running this line for your own political benefit'. We only have to pick up the papers. The editorial writers are not exactly card-carrying members of the Liberal Party. For example this article, headed `Now pray there is no relapse', appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this is an economic recovery, we had better pray there is no relapse. The anaemic, unsteady and uneven growth revealed in yesterday's national accounts figures flatly contradicted the claim by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, that the economy is "on the path to widespread and sustained economic growth".</PARA>
<PARA>I think it put it very nicely when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Either he was trying to boost the Government's flagging political stocks or he just does not understand the numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>Which one is it? Either he does not understand, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, or he is just pushing a political line for his own benefit. The only jobs Government members are interested in are their own. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate investment has slumped for 11 consecutive quarters and the outlook for rebuilding the nation's productive base continues to be gloomy. . . a generally anaemic economy, with an alarming taste for imports, means unemployment will remain high for quite some time.</PARA>
<PARA>Kenneth Davidson, no great fan of the Liberal Party, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The March quarter national accounts show why the Keating Government is on the nose with voters.</PARA>
<PARA>Alan Wood, perhaps at a different end of the spectrum, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when we come to look at the sources of future growth and their prospects the outlook becomes more uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA>George Megalogenis says in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the pace of the recovery is more than three times slower than the corresponding pick-up after the last recession and is not yet strong enough to put a cap on the unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to note the disturbing sign in respect of exports. When we look at the underlying fundamentals of the Australian economy, we see that we have a long way to go. The Government cannot stand up here and say, `We have fixed it. We are going to have more of the same, because it is working, and Australia is going on to a bigger and brighter future', when the reality is that some of the figures are adverse to our future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I particularly want to focus on the investment figures. Our investment performance is absolutely appalling. Until we get a sustained growth in investment, we are not going to have a sustained pick-up in jobs. It is as simple as that. Until people have a sense of confidence in the future of this country and are prepared to stake their money in the future of this country by investing, we can basically kiss away any sustained pick-up in growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total private investment we have had 11 consecutive quarterly falls. It has been dropping month in, month out for nearly three years. The Treasurer has a great graph on which the line that was coming down is now on the way up. I have a graph showing private investment. I am told that investment as a percentage of GDP&mdash;as a percentage of the total national cake&mdash;is at an all-time record low. Let us look at the history of it in the last two or three years. For those honourable members who cannot see the graph, it shows investment starting up high and dropping like a stone. There is an absolutely remorseless fall off in investment, which means that it is very difficult to see a pick-up in investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer is going to say, `This is in an economic cycle. Things are crook for a while, but when things pick up, after a while investment will pick up'. We have heard it all before. I have had this job for nearly two years now. I can refer honourable members to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>in the last two years&mdash;in May or August 1990&mdash;in which Government members were saying exactly the same thing. They were saying, `By March of next year'&mdash;that is, last March&mdash;`we will be bounding along in a growing, strong economy'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should anyone believe Government members when they have been so wrong month in, month out? I know they are going to say, `It is the lagged effect'. It is all predicated on their claim that this is just like any other garden variety recession: things are bad for a while, they pick up, you get a job, and everybody loses his job. Frankly, that is not right. All the evidence shows that not only is this the worst recession since the Depression, but also it is a very different sort of recession from those which we had in 1982-83 or 1974. Unfortunately, as we look to some pick-up in the Australian economy, the thing which is going to impede investment is that we still have very high real interest rates. One of the reasons for that is that we have a massive debt to the rest of the world, propping up high real interest rates when we take inflation into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that is different from some other recessions is that a lot of investment is in the commercial building sector. Everybody knows we have a massive glut in the commercial building sector. We are not going to get a pick-up in investment there. The reality is that we have got a lot of empty office space through all the major CBDs. This is not going to be a source of pick-up in the investment figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the total private investment figures, but it is also worth noting the equipment investment figures. The figure actually dropped back another 4.3 per cent in the March quarter. It was 4.6 per cent in the December quarter, but it was 1.8 per cent and 3.5 per cent in the two preceding quarters. In other words, there is no sense of a pick-up there at all. In fact, March was just about as bad as December. The Government is saying that things are on the up, but the latest March quarter figure was 0.6 per cent; it was better in the December quarter, when it was 0.7 per cent. Where is the pick-up in that, Minister? The truth is it was a very flat performance in the March quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second area of concern from the Opposition's point of view is what is happening on the export side in respect of the balance of payments. Yesterday, not only did we have the national accounts, which tell us about investment, consumption, spending and such things; we also had the latest estimate of this country's debt. It is a salutary reminder to us all of the magnitude of our problems, because net debt was up again, from $144 billion to $148 billion. That is nearly $8,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. Do not blame it on the last Government, because when this Government came in this country's debt was about $23 billion. Today it is $148 billion&mdash;and we saw evidence yesterday that it is still climbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening with the balance of payments is of concern, because March was not a good quarter. The Australian Bureau of Statistics review of the balance of payments for the March quarter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In volume terms, exports of goods and services fell $279m, while imports of goods and services rose $91m. The resulting decrease of $370m in the surplus on goods and services will make a negative contribution of 0.5 percentage points to the March quarter 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, volumes were down. It did not look as bad as it might have, because prices were up a bit. But the underlying problem is that exports were falling and imports were growing. That is the wrong way around for this country. We have to export more and import less. To import less, we have to produce more in Australia; we have to remove many of the taxes on our business community, so that they can then afford to employ more people and produce at cheaper costs. We can then compete against imports and start to fix the two big problems&mdash;unemployment and our massive and growing debt to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a problem with investment; the problem with the balance of payments is staring us in the face; and the other problem is the imports to sales ratio. It is a measure of the extent of imports as a percentage of the total sales in the economy. There is nothing wrong with imports per se, provided we can afford them. Our problem is that the latest set of figures show a growing number of imports coming in. We have the third highest figure of sales to imports ratio on record. It suggests that we just do not have the capacity in the Australian economy to produce more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent figure given by Access Economics was very revealing. It showed that we actually went backwards on capital stock in the December quarter. That ought to have set alarm bells ringing in the heads of the Treasurer and his advisers. They have been diminishing the capital stock of the productive capacity of the Australian economy. So much for the chances of some booming recovery. The reality is that, when we look at the figures and the fine print, we see, unfortunately, that the situation is pretty crook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the consequences for jobs one sees that, again, it is not a happy picture. The projection on unemployment for 1992-93 by Access Economics is a rate of 10.7 per cent. So we are a long way off fixing the problem. I say to the Minister: put your politics aside for a moment and ask yourself what you are going to do for this beaten generation&mdash;those 680,000 kids in a home where neither parent has a job. He is a long way from the big reforms which this country needs. He ought to abolish payroll tax, reduce income tax, double the family allowance, take tax off the business community, and give this country the fundamental reforms that it so desperately needs. Do not stand up and give us your smug, arrogant `She's all right; more of the same is what this country needs' attitude. We need fundamental reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) would have been half as long if he had not spent time trying to anticipate what I was going to say. He could have saved all of those opposite, who were given the task of sitting through his dreary exposition, 7 1/2 minutes. Instead, they had to listen to him for 15 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am always happy to debate sensibly these issues which are brought forward, but I do wish the Opposition, and particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would approach these things in a rather more candid way than the way he does repeatedly. This is a debate about the fact that Australia is now recording an annual growth rate of something probably over 2 per cent at least. Far from the Opposition saying, `This is a good sign but there are a few areas which deserve attention', the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `This is all shocking; the Government is trying to gild the lily; the Minister is trying to exaggerate the circumstances and really things could not be worse'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened in my room to a speech by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) in which he made a number of the points that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I think, inexpertly made. He particularly made the point about unemployment and about that continuing to be a serious problem, particularly in Victoria but in other parts of the country as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return to the question of unemployment because I think the current unemployment situation is undeniably terrible and we have to see an improvement in it. But we will not begin to see an improvement in unemployment unless we see the economy growing again. That was the thing which I was heralding yesterday&mdash;the fact that we have now had two quarters of growth of around 0.7 and 0.6 per cent respectively, which is something to be pleased about. It is not something to lament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Opposition comes in here not even being prepared to say, `Well, thank goodness; at least the country is growing again. What can we do? What should the Government be doing to try to make this a more widespread and sustainable period of growth ahead of it?'. No, we just have the usual tirade to attempt, unsuccessfully, to predict what I am going to say and attempt to score some cheap political points about the failure of the Government in terms of making predictions in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one more culpable than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in terms of appalling record on what is likely to occur at any stage in the future as far as the economy is concerned. Time after time the Leader of the Opposition, in the context of any particular economic statistic, has said, `Things are getting worse; things are not getting better; Australia is hopeless; Australia is uncompetitive; we are in for a decade of struggle and travail as we try to get this economy moving again'. If anything is clear from yesterday's figures it is that the Leader of the Opposition is an appalling judge of economic developments. Whether or not people think that the economy is strong enough&mdash;I do not think that it is yet, and I have made that point&mdash;the fact that it is growing once more is something which is unambiguously good news for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very instructive to make just an examination of this level of growth, this 0.6 per cent growth in a quarter&mdash;an appalling performance, to be disregarded, to be totally discounted, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Let me just make a comparison. I am not going to spend my time trying to blame our predecessors for all of what has happened&mdash;</PARA>

They revealed in the last two quarters a growth rate which was superior to the average rate recorded through all of those long, barren, Liberal-Country Party years from 1976 to 1983.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I grant the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the employment situation is a legitimate target for him to focus on and, as I have said, I will come to that. But he wants to pick, as he does in his graph, the question of private investment. He anticipates what I am going to say&mdash;which I will say&mdash;which is that private investment has always been pro-cyclical. In every recovery private investment has picked up after the recovery has begun. Even taking that point on board, let us just examine what is the real private gross fixed capital expenditure now compared with what it was in 1982-93. In 1990-91, a year which those opposite have targeted as being an appalling level for investment, it was $42.5 billion. In 1982-83, their last year, in the same dollars it was $30.8 billion. So there was $30.8 billion worth of investment in the last year of the coalition Government, yet there was $42.5 billion in our last year&mdash;and a weak year as far as we are concerned, and a year that we considered to be too weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course we want to see investment improving. That is why in the One Nation statement we decided to restructure the depreciation allowances. That is why we decided to bring in the pooled development funds. That is why we decided to bring in the infrastructure bonds. That is why we decided to bring in the development allowance. All these are designed to focus on the inadequacy of investment and to provide some incentives through the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do those opposite do in relation to these tax incentives to boost investment? They come in here and try to vote them down. They vote against the very measures which are designed to give Australia a more competitive capital regime as far as the taxation system is concerned. Struggle as I might through all of those long, boring 600 or 800 pages of Fightback, where do I find a suggestion of how depreciation might be changed? Only in the last few weeks, in response to One Nation, have those opposite decided that they had better have a look at business taxation in the depreciation area. So what has happened is that, in the wake of One Nation, a few people in business have said to those opposite, `My God, this has been a great deficiency in your proposal and you had better do something about it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned to provide in Australia a competitive taxation regime in order to provide some stimulus to investment which, I concur absolutely with the Deputy Leader, must improve&mdash;and, I predict, will improve as the recovery takes hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just concentrate for a moment on this issue of unemployment. I am not trying to duck it. During the last six months, we have seen unemployment basically stuck at around 10.4 or 10.5 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. It is worth while if we are to have a sensible debate about this for the Opposition at least to acknowledge that there are two factors at work here. One is obviously the recession, the economic cycle which has had its own effect on the employment rate, on the labour market. But, as well as that, there is the question of restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the restructuring that has taken place in the Australian economy, whether it is in response to changes in protection policy, reduction in tariffs and subsidies or whether it is in reform of government business enterprises, whether at the Commonwealth or State level, one would have thought that those opposite, given all their bravado and heroism that they have gone on with in Fightback about the need for more of this&mdash;in fact, I would have said lunatic amounts of restructuring in relation to some of our manufacturing industries&mdash;one would have thought that at least they would acknowledge that part of the job losses can be dealt with by restructuring and making our economy more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lamenting as he does the fact that we ought to be doing better on the export front, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ought to acknowledge that where we have been weak on the export front in the last couple of months has been in the agricultural sector, and to a small extent in the resource sector. But where have we been doing well over the last 10 years, and where are we continuing to do well? It is in the manufacturing sector and in the services sector. In both those areas we are recording record levels of export growth which are not just recession induced. We are getting some of the fundamental changes and redirecting Australian industry away from our tiny little, relatively speaking, domestic market towards the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition berates us about the pace of change, about the need for tariffs to be reduced to zero as quickly as possible and the need for public business enterprises to be sold. To be sold for what purpose? To be sold so that someone else can restructure them. What does restructuring mean to those opposite? It is a code for throwing lots of people out of work so that these enterprises become `more efficient'. Of course that is something which is already happening. But, frankly, I do object to the duplicity of the Deputy Leader when he does not even acknowledge that part of our slackness in the labour market, part of the unacceptably high unemployment rate, is due to just the kind of restructuring that he has been urging upon us, which he says should be faster and which he says under those opposite would be faster, would go further and would go into more areas than we have already been into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows&mdash;even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, if he had a moment of candour in his life, would recognise and acknowledge this&mdash;that at least the initial consequences, whatever might be the eventual consequences, of Fightback would be more unemployment, not less. That is what is designed into the approach of those opposite. One of the reasons why they are going to be so hard, heartless and cruel to the unemployed is that they know that there will be more of them and they want to spend less money on them. That is the reason for their approach. </PARA>

That is why we are trying to persuade the States to take a better attitude to vocational education and training. That is why we are offering hundreds of millions of dollars to expand that sector to provide better opportunities for our young people.

If that increase is annualised, that is an increase of 9.6 per cent per year. What hope do we have if this keeps up? Sure, inflation is down, but it is only flat because of the severe recession, or depression, that we have at the moment. I would venture to say that inflation is probably near the bottom of what it is going to be. If we do get any upturn, we will get a surge in imports and there will be an immediate deterioration in the balance of payments that will exacerbate the foreign debt and lead to higher inflation.

Let us look at the last quarterly figure for investment. As the shadow Treasurer said, we have just had the lowest level of equipment investment relative to GDP in Australia's history. That is absolutely unbelievable. Investment fell 4.3 per cent for the quarter, which brought it to 13.5 per cent for the year. These are horrific figures by anybody's standards.

What has it done since it has been in government? It has introduced a whole raft of new taxes: a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax and has tripled the wholesale sales tax collections and quadrupled the fuel excise.

I am sure that Australians do not believe him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member raised the bogey of Australia's foreign debt. It is often raised in this House, and it is a cause for concern for us all. But it needs to be put in proportion. We need to understand that our foreign debt&mdash;$140 billion or whatever the net figure is&mdash;represents, for somebody who has an income of about $30,000 in a country like Australia, which has an income of hundreds of billions of dollars, a mortgage of $10,000 on his or her home. Anybody living in any capital city in this country who understands anything about financing his or her own home understands that that sort of mortgage repayment is eminently manageable. We need to understand that that is the order of magnitude we are talking about. Australia has an income of $450 billion to $500 billion. We need to understand that and put it in context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important for us to consider the Opposition's suggestion&mdash;and, indeed, the honourable member for Parkes has introduced some new measure of productivity&mdash;that productivity has declined.

We need to look very closely at some of the things that the honourable member said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance is about the evidenced weakness in the Australian economy. But let us look at some of the fundamentals of that economy. For instance, we are given the opportunity to measure the performance of this Government. As we climb out of a downturn and a recession, we have quarterly growth at 0.6 per cent. It is interesting to note, as was pointed out by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), that that represents an improvement on the figure that was obtained by the Opposition in the average of all of the quarters when it was in government. If this is a terrible figure, those opposite are saying that their performance during those halcyon days of 1976 to 1983 was indeed abominable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the fundamentals of Australia's economy now, one can see that we are concerned about the level of unemployment. Nobody in this place should suggest that that is not the case. But the fundamentals through which we can rebound from these circumstances are universally acceptable and universally good. We have an inflation rate which, measured by the CPI or the implicit price deflator&mdash;whichever measure one wants to take&mdash;is about 2 or 2 1/2 per cent. Indeed, those sorts of figures are very encouraging for somebody who wishes to invest in this country. The expectations for inflation are also very encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The profit share for business is measured, on the current figure, at about 16 per cent. The profit share at the nadir of the Opposition's recession was measured at about 12 per cent. We are indeed in an improved circumstance in respect of that measure. Average earnings have increased by about 3 per cent over the last year and the cost of labour has declined. So, for investment purposes, those fundamentals are very encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit has almost reached stabilisation point, and that is a very encouraging development. If one looks structurally at the Budget and at the concern about the level of Budget deficit, one can compare our figure of about 2 1/2 per cent of GDP with the figure that we inherited in 1983, when it represented nearly 5 per cent of GDP. The level of interest rates in this country is historically low, especially in the last 20 or 30 years. If one looks at all these things, one will find that we have an environment in which investment is encouraged and we have a group of fundamentals which will allow us to rebound from the circumstance that we are in at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not deny that we are seeing the beginnings of a steady recovery. We believe this recovery will occur over a number of years. We believe that next year we will see the sorts of growth figures that are predicted in the One Nation statement and we understand that this will be underpinned by sound fundamentals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who want to invest in business in this country&mdash;those who want to put their money where their mouth is&mdash;want to know that the fundamentals are sound and that the future projections of those fundamentals are consistent and believable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that unemployment, as has been indicated by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), is of great concern to us. But all Australians should be wary of the solutions outlined by the Opposition. One of the solutions is to have a consumption tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) put forward the proposal that we should be creating dead-end jobs for people. It needs to be understood in this country that we have unacceptable unemployment rates. They are the result of a coincidence of factors. One of those factors is, of course, the cyclical nature of our economy. Indeed, if people wanted to, they could point the finger at monetary policy; and I think they would be correct. But we have to look at other important factors. The restructuring that is occurring in our economy, the downturn in the rural sector, and the downturn in international circumstances are critical to that level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to do something about this problem, we have to look at all of those factors.

We have given increased depreciation allowances for businesses, development allowances, and the sorts of things that will target the investment where it needs to be. That will be directly responsible for a change in Australia's culture and will develop the sort of investment pattern we want to develop in this country&mdash;one that is realistic and sustainable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Badgerys Creek Airport development, Stage 1.</PARA>
<PARA>Badgerys Creek is located in the Liverpool local government area, some 46 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district. The site is 20 kilometres west of Liverpool, 20 kilometres south-east of Penrith and 23 kilometres north-west of Campbelltown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a period of 40 years several studies have been carried out in relation to a site for a proposed second Sydney airport. In February 1986, the Government announced that Badgerys Creek had been selected as the site. Acquisition commenced in that year and has now been completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following evaluation of the airport needs in the Sydney basin, the Government announced, in March 1989, a comprehensive and integrated strategy which included the commencement at Badgerys Creek of a staged development of a second major Sydney airport. The initial development provided only for general aviation. The airport will be operated by the Federal Airports Corporation under a 10-year lease agreement with two options which could extend the lease for a further 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This stage 1 of the development will provide a general aviation airport which will be designed within the constraint of being easily expanded into stage 2&mdash;domestic and international development. The facilities to be provided will include a sealed runway, parallel taxiway, aircraft parking, runway and taxiway lighting, an access road and parking, together with a terminal building of about 100 square metres. Also involved will be cut-to-fill earthworks; site services, including water supply; drainage and sewerage, including on-site sewage treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the work has been estimated at an indicative cost not to exceed $56.1m at December 1990 prices. The overall duration of stage 1 is 27 months from commencement of the detailed design process with the new airport operational before the end of 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I would acknowledge the presence in the House of the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), who has been assiduous in striving and fighting very long and hard to bring this proposition to fruition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuing the debate on the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992, I would just like to make a few closing comments in the short time left to me. The Bill demonstrates the industry's commitment to research and development. It has demonstrated that it wishes the levy to be increased in order to undertake further research and development. The Bill also demonstrates, of course, the commitment by the Government in matching that levy. Research and development will help the industry to find the way forward to more efficiency and greater competitiveness and show the way to the future for the sugar industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's position on the industry in general terms, of course, is just that: to assist the industry and to negotiate and cooperate with the sugar industry. That is also shown in one of the big issues facing the sugar industry at the present time&mdash;that is, the response to the Industry Commission report. The sugar industry finds the Industry Commission report most unpalatable and it needs to respond in such a way that the Government can take notice of it. The Government's position is that it will not be driven by the Industry Commission report, but it will give due weight to the just arguments of the industry as to how they see themselves progressing. The genuineness of that position is proved by the way in which the Government handled a very similar issue with regard to the dairy industry. In recent days, the dairy industry welcomed the Government's response to it through legislation that was passed recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Opposition is completely averse to tariff protection for the sugar industry. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) categorically stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will eliminate tariff protection by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has also endorsed the draft report of the Industry Commission which came out before the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document and which recommended zero tariffs by 1998. I repeat the statement by Harry Bonanno, the Chairman of the Cane Growers Association, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if any party policy statement is so inflexible as to not accommodate the rightful needs of an industry as important as the . . . sugar industry, then either the statement will end up being changed or those who support the statement should be changed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was obviously directed at the leadership of the coalition, who cannot and will not negotiate with the sugar industry in any way. Mr Ballantyne, the General Manager of the Cane Growers Association said, after a 45-minute meeting with the Opposition Leader, that Dr Hewson had confirmed the coalition's position that, if elected to government, there would be no special arrangements for the sugar industry, or for any industry, and that tariffs would continue to be progressively reduced towards zero from 1993. This shows a real problem for the Opposition parties. The country areas of New South Wales&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is all very interesting, although a lot of it is not correct. But this Bill deals with an amendment to the Sugar Cane Levy Act. It is not just about sugar; it is about increasing the maximum rate of levy from 10c per tonne to 15c per tonne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is probably about time that we introduced an element of sweetness into this debate. I know a few puns have been made along those lines already. People might be wondering why somebody with an electorate that does not have any sugarcane growing in it might want to speak on a Bill that has to do with the sugarcane industry, the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill. Honourable members know that I represent one of the most magnificent electorates in the world, an electorate even more beautiful than the electorates of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), both of whom spoke earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that I have the essence of sweetness running in my veins due to the fact that I come from a long line of sugarcane producers and people who have always been interested in research. That is why it is relevant that I address this levy legislation. Going way back to the last century, those people would have all been in favour of research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great-grandfather had large cane holdings on the Clarence River. My mother was born in a house on one of the cane farms on Chatsworth Island. My great-grandfather, at the end of last century and at the beginning of this century, had one of the 102 sugar mills in New South Wales. Interestingly enough, my father, who migrated from Scotland, was engaged in research in 1921 at the Mossman mill just out of Cairns. Wonder of wonders, my wife, who is a New Zealander, had a great-grandfather who was the first manager of the mill at Broadwater on the Richmond River. I mention these matters as qualifications for my obvious interest in supporting the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the maximum rate of levy on sugarcane to 15c per tonne as provided in section 10 of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. Quite a bit has been said about the sugar industry and I would like to repeat a few things so that these details can be recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar is one of Australia's most important agricultural industries, as has been mentioned by a number of people. Therefore, it is critical that attention be paid to maximising research and development for such an important industry&mdash;hence this levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sugar is Australia's third most valuable export crop after wheat and cotton, and 75 to 80 per cent of raw sugar production is exported, so it is a major export. As a result, valuable dollars are imported into the coffers of the country. In 1991-92, production of raw sugar was 3.2 million tonnes from a drought affected crop of 21.3 million tonnes of sugarcane, with a gross value of production estimated at $585m. This is well below the record of 3.8 million tonnes of sugar produced in 1989-90, but production is expected to rise again with increases in the area of land under cane. All the research available, and the increased research that will come as a result of this increased levy, will be extremely helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of sugar in one's diet is something that has been debated over and over again. Sugar is referred to as nature's sweetener. A lot of people make up stories about sugar that has been refined, saying that the refined product is virtually useless as a food, and so on. I would like to mention the fact that it is a pure food. We are all born with an innate taste for sugar, and the newborn infant shows a preference for sweetness. So we have an inclination towards the consumption of sugar from a very early period in our lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions that I raised a moment ago with regard to the value of sugar is worth mentioning. A lot of research has been carried out on its value as a result of the levy that has existed up to the present time. Some of the research information available tells us that there are no significant nutritional differences between white sugar, raw sugar, brown sugar and honey. A lot of people go to a lot of trouble to say that they are vastly different in terms of their value as foodstuffs, but research and development undertaken by CSIRO and many other organisations show that there is no significant nutritional difference between any of those foods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That ought to put to rest a lot of what is being said today about white sugar being very harmful for us and that we ought to stick to some of the other sugars. Of course, sugars are used differently in foods because of their distinctive flavours and colours. But, as I said, nutritionally there is not much difference between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the research already undertaken as a result of the levy that has been in place has been conducted by the CSIRO. We often read on some of the products that we get from supermarket that there is no added sugar. I would like to mention a couple of things that have been put forward by researchers into that kind of advertising and put to rest some of the myths associated with that particular claim. It is not an impressive claim by any means. An article I have before me states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no real nutritional benefits, as `no added sugar' often means sweetened with juice. These juices (used in many products) are actually concentrated syrups made up of a mixture of sugars&mdash;sucrose, fructose and dextrose and will be very similar in kilojoule and nutrient content to one using sugar. Thus the consumer who has bought the product to reduce kilojoules (calories) has been misled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, the value of sugar as a preservative long acknowledged is now beginning to be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>Researchers at the CSIRO Food Processing Division in Sydney, who have been some of the beneficiaries of levies in the past, are dealing with increased requests from the food industry and consumers to identify moulds that are being found on new products with decreased sugar or salt content. One of the comments made by scientists is this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing the sugar and salt causes problems because these bind moisture and hold it so that the food is protected from mould. These products have a shorter shelf life, so mould growth is being noticed two days after opening e.g. in jams.</PARA>
<PARA>The health risks of eating food contaminated by fungi is not known but, as many moulds can produce toxins, the CSIRO advises people not to consume them. There are all kinds of research being undertaken in a great variety of ways by the sugar industry into the various claims that are being made not only with regard to sugar being unsafe but also with regard to the benefits to health of sugar. I want to quote from an article which deals with the safety of sugar. It follows some of the research that has been undertaken in other parts of the world, and is an indication of the kind of research that will be undertaken and able to be increased with the added levy that we are debating at the moment. Right from the outset, as a result of a great amount of research that has been done in the United States, for example, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sugar is safe. It has been found to be so, over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the result of research into the use of the product. I want to quote from the three most recent reports because they cover the kinds of activities which we will be engaged in and extended by our own research people in this country. The United States Food and Drug Administration task force reported on the evaluation of health aspects of sugars contained in carbohydrate sweeteners as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other than the contribution to dental caries, there is no conclusive evidence on sugars that demonstrates a hazard to the general public when sugars are consumed at the levels that are now current and in the manner now practised.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a definitive statement from a very well recognised research organisation that has benefited from levies that are being paid in other countries for this kind of research. The British Nutrition Foundation's task force report on sugars and syrups in 1987 reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no evidence of a direct association between sugar consumption and heart disease, cancer, gallstones or diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another very significant and important comment to have come forward as a result of this research. The United Kingdom Department of Health committee on medical aspects of food policy conducted an inquiry and report on dietary sugars and human disease in 1989. This is the finding it arrived at:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sugar does not contribute to heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, gallstones or other major diseases; although, as is the case in many areas of nutrition, more research is needed.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the kinds of things that have taken place in other countries. A great deal has taken place in this country as a result of research into this wonderful food, as I describe it. I am very happy that we are debating this Bill to increase the availability of research funding to the sugar industry. I do this as one who has had this sweetness, as I said, running through my veins from a long way back. I know that the research which will result will be of a great benefit to the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There does not seem to be much opposition to the Sugar Cane Levy Amendment Bill, and what became a pretty wide ranging debate earlier in the day I think has raised a number of issues that require some response. I say at the outset that I believe there is a very strong future for the sugar industry in this country. This piece of legislation will help underpin it because it provides the basis for increasing the amount of money that is spent on research and development within the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) took issue on the question as to whether there was adequate funding. I think he confused what we were talking about in this legislation associated with Commonwealth contributions with what is paid in addition by way of State contributions to R&amp;D. But the fact of the matter is that this piece of legislation will increase the proportion that goes into R&amp;D, and it comes to us at the request of the industry. I join with all of those who have congratulated the industry in having the foresight to support this decision, which is the reason we are in the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter, though, is that that strong future needs more than just an underpinning by commitment to  research and development. It needs a process by which we bring together all of the respective elements in the industry&mdash;not just the canegrowers, the millers, the refiners or the manufacturers, but all of those together. Such a structure does not exist in this industry at the moment. It is for that reason that I established the committee that is to be chaired by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson took issue on this, saying that that was fobbing the matter off for consideration by a committee chaired by a backbencher. The honourable member for Dawson misunderstands the purpose of this committee, which is to bring together the different elements, the different stages, in the process of production to manufacture. We do not, as I said before, have such a structure in the industry. We did have it in the dairy industry, and I think it was very useful in helping us arrive at an outcome. The Australian Dairy Industry Council is a very representative organisation of both producers and manufacturers, but there is no such similar organisation in relation to the sugar industry&mdash;and that is the purpose of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to abrogate my responsibility or, indeed, not to pursue the same approach as I did with the dairy industry. I make the commitment in this House, as I have indeed to members of the sugar industry&mdash;and the canegrowers in particular, with whom I have met at length over the last few weeks&mdash;that I am prepared to deal with them directly. I believe we need a mechanism by which these linkages between the various stages of operation can be achieved. I think, and the industry recognises, that it needs to get more effectively into the value adding activity, it needs to improve the technology, and it needs to promote economies of scale. I do not think there is disagreement with that view. The question is: how do we do it? What I have done is to propose a means by which we can address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason for the Courtice committee, if you like, but again I think that my preparedness to demonstrate, by way of practical outcome in dairy, has given a very important signal to the canegrowers in this nation. They have had the opportunity of speaking with the dairy industry to understand how that process worked, and I think that they are well satisfied with that. We have the runs on the board and I think that, our having achieved a very successful outcome in dairy, the sugar industry now wants to get on with the task of developing a similar response for it. I am committed to ensuring that we have a strong sugar industry, one that does more with the product that is produced&mdash;and, indeed, produces more product, for that matter&mdash;and one that converts it in a more effective and efficient way than in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of the committee's report on these elements is really something that the committee needs to address in the early stages of its activities. I do not see it as being one, as someone suggested by way interjection, that is simply helping us get over problems associated with elections in the future. I think we can work constructively with the industry to bring forward a growth strategy for the industry, and I would prefer to do that sooner than later. But I will not rush the participants in relation to that. I think there are some important issues that they need to address. It will be an industry driven approach and the timing will be as a consequence of consultations that I have with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to another issue that was raised predominantly in the speech by the honourable member for Dawson. He took a lot of time and effort in dissecting, criticising and analysing the recommendations in the Industry Commission's report. And well he might, because that is really the problem that the coalition parties face in relation to the sugar industry. It is all very well for him to assert in this place that coalition policy, and indeed Fightback, is for negligible levels of tariff rather than zero. But I simply remind the honourable member for Dawson&mdash;and I am pleased to see that he is in the House now&mdash;of table 4.1 on page 34 of the executive summary of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, which is a table of reforms that would be introduced by a coalition government under Fightback. Under the heading `Reform' is `Rural and manufacturing assistance'. It makes no distinction between manufacturing and rural assistance. It lumps them all in together. After the words `Rural and manufacturing assistance' it has `(IC)'; in other words, if one reads the rest of the document, one sees that the Industry Commission, the IC, has identified a number of savings that will produce efficiencies in the industry. It would adopt the Industry Commission's report. That is there in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, under the heading `Measures involved', it clearly states, in relation to rural and manufacturing assistance, `Elimination of tariff, quota and bounty assistance'. That is in<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Fightback!,</EMPHASIS> and the canegrowers of this country know that is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>. That is why they refused to meet the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) when he went to the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) the other day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply pose this question to the House: if <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> says `negligible tariff' and does not adopt the IC report, why did the honourable member for Dawson have to resign? If he could live with Fightback because he says that Fightback represents negligible tariffs, why is he now sitting on the back bench? He was forced to resign because Fightback really does not say `negligible tariffs'. There has been some momentum of recent times to try to reinterpret the position. </PARA>

So the canegrowers of this country know that, if the coalition were to win, they would be faced with the adoption of the Industry Commission's report and zero tariff in accordance with that report either by the date proposed, which I think was 1998, or within the shorter time scale, depending upon the compensation payments contained in it.</PARA></TALK.START>

It made no specific distinction for sugar; it made none for dairy. As I said on another occasion, the dairy package could not have been delivered by a coalition government.

If there are any doubts about the success of the mechanism, I urge honourable members on the other side, as few of them as there are, to sit down with the dairy industry of this country and see how this process has been successfully developed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can identify the circumstances for dairy that are similar now to sugar&mdash;that is, a hostile Industry Commission's report, a report which, the industry said, if implemented would wipe it out. But the industry was able to sit down with us, develop a strategy consistent with what we had outlined generally for tariffs and get an agreement that has been not only welcomed but applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the difference between this side of the House and the coalition: we will have regard to these economic analyses that are made from time to time and we will use the disciplines and the information that might come from the Industry Commission, but we will not be driven by it. An industry policy essentially means working with industry&mdash;not governments or committees determining it and having it rubber-stamped&mdash;on the starting position of identifying what the potential is for that industry, then recognising the impediments to achieving that potential, and working with government to see whether those impediments and difficulties can be removed. That is the approach that we would adopt, standing in stark contrast to what the Opposition would have the industry face up to if ever it were elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate the honourable member for Dawson spent some time attacking the Industry Commission report and then trying to promise a great benefit to the farmers of this country as a result of Fightback. He made some comments about how this Government had done nothing but increase costs and had done nothing in the way of micro-economic reform. I found it rather odd that he spoke about how little had happened on the waterfront and then went on to say how our terminals in the sugar industry were amongst the most efficient in the world. How would we achieve that unless we had the cooperation of those operating the waterfront and the terminals? He admitted in his speech that the last occasion on which he had had an opportunity to speak to the Queensland sugar industry was four years ago. That would be a great font of information as to the present circumstances!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very interesting table. I used it when I spoke to the National Farmers Federation a couple of weeks ago. The index of competitiveness is very important in terms of understanding how export industries are going to grow. This table demonstrates the measure of competitiveness in the period 1976-83&mdash;call it the Fraser years or call it the pre-accord years&mdash;and then the period 1983-91, which is when the accord has operated and when this Government has been in operation. As much as honourable members on the other side of the House might like to criticise and denigrate the prices and incomes accord, that is the measure of competitiveness in those two periods, and there has been a significant improvement in competitiveness under the accord.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australians speak of their multicultural society with some pride. That has not always been the case. In the unenlightened Menzies years and earlier, Australians were taught to fear reds under the bed and the threat of the yellow peril. The Whitlam Labor Government did much to educate the Australian community in terms of accepting and understanding its diverse multicultural make-up. The notion of a perpetually cosy Anglo-Saxon society stuck down in the antipodes was questioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the Whitlam Government on this score will be acknowledged by history. It was a period that saw significant societal change. Australian people began to think differently about their country and the people who made it what it was. It was no longer a case of thinking we lived in a WASP-ish colonial backwater. Australians were made to consider the true make-up of their society. That is in stark contrast to the coalition governments immediately before and after the Whitlam Government, when there was no progress, no change, just blame. Given the chance to have an honest look at Australian society in its complexity, I would venture to say that most Australians very much liked what they saw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this Government's response to the finding of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is of far greater historical importance than Whitlam's efforts to open the eyes of all Australians to the complex nature of our society. Our indigenous population is the very cornerstone of a rich multicultural society. But Australia has been a fractured society, torn apart by the absurd and arrogant notion of terra nullius. Our Aboriginal people have been treated with a mixture of ignorance and contempt by the non-Aboriginal community, and our society has suffered as a result. We have failed to adequately acknowledge the important contributions made to Australian life by our Aboriginal people. We have found ourselves living in a divided society, with benefits to all Australians diminished as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This response to the in-depth, intelligent and commendable report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody sets about addressing the causes of this division as well as the gross inadequacies that led to the deaths of these 99 young Australians, who represent only a proportion of those Aboriginal people who have died in custody through white Australian history. Central to this is the recognition of the need to achieve reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community. Without this reconciliation, any action taken by governments will be of the bandaid variety. This response acknowledges that we can no longer take that sort of approach and that we are faced with a long, hard road. It acknowledges the work to be done by everyone in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report points out that because of the historical experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their continuing disadvantage, relationships with non-Aboriginal people are often characterised by `distrust, enmity and disputation'. In supporting the process of reconciliation, the report says that to succeed it must be accompanied by a renewed commitment to addressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social and economic disadvantage; that it must have strong and bipartisan support; and that the focus should be on the process of reconciliation and not on any instrument which may be an outcome of that process. The Commonwealth Government has already established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation with 25 council members, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginals, from a wide cross-section of the community. The Federal Parliament has unanimously given its support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three fundamental principles underpin the process of reconciliation and the work of the Council. First, there is a decade-long commitment to promoting a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and of the need to redress that disadvantage. There could be no better way to celebrate the history of our Federation in 2001 than by witnessing significant change in our respect for and understanding of non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minjunbal Aboriginal Museum in my electorate of Richmond is an example of the early stages of this educative process. The popularity of the museum with local school groups, and other groups, points to a new generation of Australians&mdash;better educated, better informed and better equipped to really tackle the hard task of reconciliation than the generations brought up with the contemptible notion of terra nullius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission has argued that considerable advances can be achieved by increasing the amount of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies in teacher training and schools. The Commonwealth will encourage the development and implementation of Aboriginal studies curricula through its national reconciliation and schooling strategy. The strategy involves a number of commitments which will make a substantial contribution to the way Australian society views its indigenous population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal studies curricula are to be developed for all schools across Australia from kindergarten to year 12. There will be teacher education courses aimed at promoting greater sensitivity towards Aboriginal issues and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. There is also a commitment to establish a sister school system between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal schools. And, as is already happening to an extent in my electorate, this Government's response includes the promotion of greater understanding by students of their local Aboriginal community and its history. There is also a commitment to increase the school community's capacity to research local Aboriginal history and to involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in classroom activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major principle underpinning the process of reconciliation is the commitment to social justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and an ongoing national commitment to cooperation to address disadvantage. One cannot help wondering where the reconciliation process could possibly go under a coalition government with its commitment to reducing the budget for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs by $80m per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this Government's response to the report includes a commitment to extensive consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the wider community to determine whether all Australians want a more formal document of reconciliation. The Royal Commission report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commissioner Dodson speaks of the need for a maturing of the relationship between Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people; a deeper understanding of how each sees the other and why; a bringing out of the common ground between us.</PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commission found that relationships between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the non-Aboriginal society were at the heart of the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody. Relationships must be very bad indeed when we consider that the report found that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were being imprisoned at a rate 29 times higher than that for non-Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In earlier remarks on this statement, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) quite correctly made reference to the referendum figures. Interestingly, he pointed out that, despite its high acceptance across Australia, there was great disparity between urban and country areas in terms of voting for the referendum. He said that in urban areas the non-acceptance of the referendum was down to 4 per cent; whereas in country areas it was as high as 20 per cent. It is a little difficult to reconcile the discrepancy between those figures. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in an attempt to do so, I would say that the issue that non-Aboriginal Australians have not been prepared to face up to also goes to the heart of what reconciliation is all about: the attitudes of non-Aboriginal Australians; the educative process, which has produced a culture within us; employment; and academic credentials. That was certainly the case in earlier days, but it is becoming less so now. Non-Aboriginals were very unaccepting of a society and a culture which did not embrace the particular attributes of employment, or some academic credentials. As we move to attaining more of a multicultural society, all that will hopefully pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reconciliation cannot be advanced without evidence of positive measures to address the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and indeed all Australians, need to see evidence that the inequalities&mdash;economic, social and physical&mdash;to which they have been subjected are being readily addressed. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has been made aware by ATSIC of a number of concerns relating to reconciliation that serve to highlight the complex nature of the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participants at several meetings raised important issues when they called for consultations with the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to be done on a community basis, led by traditional leaders in their own language. These groups have also highlighted the fact that reconciliation, as presented by the Government, is not properly understood by Aboriginal people, particularly those who need to relate it in the context of Aboriginal law. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are sceptical about reconciliation. One speaker at a meeting held in Canberra expressed this perfectly. He said, `How can you be reconciled when you've never been married?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians have been married, it has been an ugly shotgun wedding, marred by violence, substance abuse, the breakdown of the family unit, and worse. But I believe it is an alliance all the same that has not irretrievably broken down. This Government's response should ensure that the alliance is improved upon to the point where we are equal, if different, partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the process of social reconciliation has already begun in a broad sense. It was encouraging to note the media attention given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues in the days leading up to, and immediately following, the announcement of this Government's response. The treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by segments of the Australian population was heartily condemned. The tone of news reports was one of outrage. How could Australians be subjecting fellow Australians to such grossly unfair treatment? The issue of non-Aboriginal Australians' treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders was placed firmly on the public agenda. This response aims to ensure that it stays on the agenda; that it is an issue that will only be resolved by being at the fore of Australia's national conscience in the most constructive way possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Royal Commission recognised the impact, both positive and negative, that the media has on perceptions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) also mentioned this impact in his address yesterday. The report emphasised the importance of Aboriginal and Islander media in giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a public voice and raising their self image. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Koori Mail</EMPHASIS>, Australia's first national newspaper reflecting the views and concerns of Aboriginal Australians, operates from an office in south Lismore&mdash;an area adjacent to my electorate of Richmond on the north coast of New South Wales. This is a newspaper of a high standard that has been instrumental in putting many issues of concern to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders on the national agenda. The report makes a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring the viability of the media, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Koori Mail</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is reviewing its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander broadcasting policy in the light of the recommendations made by the report. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Koori Mail</EMPHASIS> is showing the important role Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander media can play in the essential reconciliation process. The same is true of both CAAMA, the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association, and TAMA, the Townsville Aboriginal Media Association. The Royal Commission's recommendations are also aimed at bringing about changes in media practices and policies in reporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. The Commonwealth accepts a responsibility to encourage the media industry to adopt strategies which will give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people better opportunities for training and employment in commercial media organisations. It will also encourage the development of journalist training courses, codes and practices on the presentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and promote the establishment of awards for excellence in Aboriginal affairs reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role that the media play in this instance is one of empowerment. This matter was addressed by the report and is summed up by the comment, `There is no other way. Only the Aboriginal people can, in the final analysis, assure their own future'. The establishment by this Government of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, has gone some of the way towards addressing the question of Aboriginal empowerment. The main emphasis of the recommendations made by the Royal Commission is the elimination of disadvantage and the growth of empowerment and the self-determination of Aboriginal society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission expressed strongly the need for Aboriginal and Islander groups to be involved in implementing its 339 recommendations. The Government's response to the recommendations in the report provides the opportunity to further incorporate the concepts of empowerment and self-determination into policy making and program development. In his overview to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Commissioner Elliott Johnston, QC, said that the whole thrust of the report was directed towards the empowerment of Aboriginal society. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-Aboriginal Australia must face the fact that for a very long time we have proceeded on the basis that Aboriginal people were inferior, were unable to make decisions affecting themselves, that we knew what was best for them; it became second nature for us to have that attitude. . . But until I examined the files of the people who died and the other material that has come before the Commission and listened to Aboriginal people speaking, I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the One Nation statement, I bring to the attention of the House some of the things that have occurred which were signalled by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made his One Nation statement on 26 February. The Prime Minister told us he had a vision for Australia which would take Australia into the twenty-first century, which would be built on cooperation and a competitive and more highly skilled and trained Australia. This was not simply some kind of vision that was plucked out of the air to make people feel good; this was a vision which was practical, constructive and on the ground.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to report to the House that I know of two things cited in the One Nation package which are happening and which will continue to happen. On Friday, along with the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, I will be inspecting the progress that has already been made on the Gold Coast rail link&mdash;that is, the extension of the rail link from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, from Beenleigh to Robina. What we have seen is action. This rail link is already in the process of construction. People have jobs out of it. It will provide development for the area and, in the long run, an opportunity for residents of Logan City to access the jobs which flow from the tourism and hospitality industry sited on Australia's Gold Coast. So there is one very clear example of action which has come out of the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major action to take place has been in the aviation industry. Many honourable members would recognise that a decision has already been taken to merge Qantas and Australian Airlines. The planning process is under way and Australians can take heart from the fact that no longer will there be huge Qantas jets flying empty from Perth, Melbourne and other places. Instead, the airline will be inextricably linked to the domestic market. As we heard today from the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), people who live in Hobart are delighted that they will be able to access international airlines from anywhere in Australia. This is revolutionary change. It is change which can come about only through cooperation and vision and by putting in place real, constructive government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major area mentioned in the One Nation statement concerns the development of the tourism industry. I was delighted to see at the Gold Coast a program being developed to attract people from other parts of Australia to the Gold Coast strip. Indeed, a whole range of prizes and excitement was being offered to lure people who live in the south, and whose winters are perhaps a little colder, to visit the delightful Gold Coast. Already it is being predicted&mdash;and it is happening this year&mdash;that there will be enormous growth in the tourism industry. In that area tourism is up by 30 per cent this year. So one has to say that this is economic recovery on a great scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does tourism bring to Australia? It brings opportunities for us to provide services and for the commercial sector to develop buildings. Australians benefit as economies are generated from the money that is spent within Australia. The tourism industry itself recognises that the number of visitors will go up from 2.4 million to 6.5 million by the end of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate this Government on being the first government to have a Minister for Tourism. The Minister is a member of Cabinet and has a national tourism strategy. I was delighted that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) was able to visit Brisbane and meet with a group of people who are heavily involved in the tourism industry. The Minister was able to hear what those people wanted to say and to discuss it with them. All those people, who were from a wide political spectrum, congratulated the Minister and the Prime Minister on the action they have taken to develop the tourism industry and on ensuring that it continues to become one of our major export earners. Indeed, it provides a whole range of jobs for our young people which are portable throughout Australia and the world. I might say that this is in great contrast to the proposal by honourable members opposite who seek to impose a 15 per cent goods and services tax on that aspect of tourism, which will certainly hurt the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as in all things in relation to the Fightback package, there are some special benefits for those who are rich. If people travel to Hawaii or some other international exotic place, they will be exempt from the GST. The rich and those who go overseas on wonderful holidays could not possibly be charged a goods and services tax. But, never fear, our local hard-working, battling Australians who want to go down the coast and stay a few nights in a caravan or cheap motel must be hit. Once again, they will be hit with a good old goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry understands this. The south-eastern Queensland industry knows that almost 80 per cent of those who holiday on the Gold Coast are Australians: it is a domestic market. Many of them are local south-eastern Queenslanders. For them, the impact of a goods and services tax is quite horrifying. I also mention those who run some of the most interesting amusement areas on the Gold Coast which lure people there all the time&mdash;Movie World, Sea World, Dreamworld and so on. Families like to go to these places to enjoy themselves. At present the admission fee is about $30 or $40 for an adult and half of that for a child. It is quite extraordinary to want to put a 15 per cent tax on such a fee. The operators understand that people will not have any more money under a goods and services tax&mdash;not to mention the fact that their accountants and office administrators will be enormously busy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am just simply drawing attention to the kinds of differences that exist between the Government and the Opposition. Here we have a One Nation package. We have already seen in place the development of the national tourism strategy. We have seen a tremendous growth in the tourism industry this year. We have also seen the change, the dramatic revolution, which is occurring in the aviation industry and which will bring national travel into the realm of feasibility for many more Australians. So we see under this Government an industry being recognised for what it is&mdash;a major export earner and also a major generator of jobs and employment for many of our young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major area that One Nation addresses, and in a very dramatic way, is the area of training. Indeed, we have already seen action on this. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) is already negotiating with the States in relation to the technical and further education sector. Many of us who have been involved in education recognise that that sector has been marked by a decline over the past decade. Whereas we have had a doubling of students staying on at secondary school&mdash;from 40 per cent to 75 or 80 per cent of our students staying on at school to year 12&mdash;and a doubling of students going to university, the TAFE sector has declined. We have to ask ourselves why. Why have the State governments found themselves unwilling or unable to put money into what is becoming a vitally important and crucial sector of education if we are to have a trained and skilled work force into the twenty-first century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money, the impetus and the drive for us to expand our TAFE section, to ensure that industry is part of TAFE, that we comply with industrial standards, that we move to the national accreditation of very many of our apprenticeships and change the nature of the way in which apprentices operate&mdash;all of those things are important and are at the heart of changing that training sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with that is the notion of entry level wages and the youth training wage. Indeed, those were addressed yesterday by the Prime Minister at the youth unemployment summit. He has acted on what he was asked for there yesterday and is going to hold a summit with business people to do something constructive and real to develop better employment strategies for our youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jobskills program is one of the very important programs that were signalled in the One Nation statement. I cite my own experience: only the week before last 116 unemployed people in my electorate of Forde were found positions under the Jobskills program. Indeed, we will be looking to place another 100 or 150 in the next couple of weeks. So those programs are providing real hope and real jobs for people on the ground. This is not some sort of vision dreamed up on a computer in the middle of the night. These are tangible projects that are happening. People understand that they are happening; they understand that they are very definitely part of the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the way we treat industry and the question of the wholesale sales tax reforms which will bring about a change in the way very many of our small companies operate. People may be interested to know that there are 800,000 small businesses in Australia, all of which would have to pay a goods and services tax if the coalition were in government. Currently, only 70,000 of them pay wholesale sales tax, and under the new regime only 16,000 of the 800,000 will be subject to the wholesale sales tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk about everything and everybody paying wholesale sales tax and say that people already have to accommodate it. Let me tell honourable members that there are over 700,000 small businesses in Australia that have nothing to do with the wholesale sales tax regime in this country&mdash;nothing to do with it. But, my goodness, would they have something to do with the goods and services tax. They would be up all night every night doing work for the Opposition. But we do not have to worry about that and people do not have to worry about that because Australians just will not buy another tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most pleasing aspects of the One Nation statement for very many families in my electorate and across Australia was the one-off payment of the family allowance. We have heard some very deprecating remarks, in particular from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others, about this one-off payment. But I can tell them that people who were putting children into school found the money very useful for school bags and school shoes, and in some parts of Australia found an ability to buy winter clothing for their children. They welcomed it and they understood that this Government is about families; it is about providing support for families and for working families. The fact that the money will continue by $3 per week per child is welcomed by all those families in Australia. They understand very clearly what One Nation is about. It is about cooperation, about working together and about creating a great and wonderful country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that this is in diametric contrast to the situation, which can only be called the tragedy of Burnie, where we see the Opposition's industrial relations policy in the workplace clearly outlined for the whole of Australia. It involves conflict, division, setting family against family, worker against worker and, of course as always, boss against worker. We understand that and we know that very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That kind of fear, mistrust, and of course ultimately lack of profitability, lack of productivity and lack of any sort of reasonable, meaningful process in the workplace, contrasts with the kind of enterprise bargains that have been negotiated under our regime. Indeed, only yesterday, one of our big unions in Australia negotiated an enterprise agreement right across Australia for about half a million workers. That is Labor Party policy. That is what One Nation is about. It is about working together to ensure that infrastructure is put in place, that things actually happen, that families are catered for and that in the big picture, when we are building roads, railways, national electricity grids, TAFE colleges and all those sorts of things for the community as a whole, we do not forget the individuals and individual families and that we continue to support them. We know very clearly that we operate as a community and that we care as a community. It is this kind or cooperative effort and cooperative spirit that dominates One Nation and that the Australian people feel and understand very clearly. It is that kind of society that they want to take into the twenty-first century. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The resurrection of the debate in this chamber on the absurdly titled One Nation statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes at a time when prospects for a return to prosperity are even more precarious than they were earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at unemployment levels. One can look at the lack of productivity. One can look at the investment figures&mdash;11 consecutive quarters as a percentage of GDP at a record low level. Indeed, as the nation slides further into the black hole of debt, of uncontrolled debt, and becomes an increasingly uncompetitive player in the world marketplace, the Prime Minister's pathetic pork-barrelling promises are revealed as the sham that most Australians already know them to be. Is it not good that the Prime Minister is now a pork producer? He is pork-barrelling. It is rather ironic. I wonder whether he will continue to tell porkies at Question Time. Those opposite should realise that the Prime Minister is just in a blind panic. It is not policy by evaluation or consideration, but panic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Government came to office in 1983, the foreign debt was about $23 billion. Since then the indebtedness has continued to climb relentlessly. It is now over $140 billion. But there is no evidence that any of the policies of this Government, particularly those outlined in the One Nation statement, will in any way reduce this horrendous sum by even $1. It may come as a surprise to honourable members opposite to know that one of the founding principles of the Australian Labor Party was the control of public debt. Those genuine representatives of the working class in whose interests the ALP was initially formed would be dismayed to see the extent to which their ideals have been corrupted a century later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, which in the last 20 years has been so comprehensively hijacked by the beard-stroking trendoids from the campuses of the 1960s and the self-interested thugs from the Swanston Street Soviet, would be disinherited by such worthy forebears as Andrew Fisher, Joe Scullin, John Curtin, Ben Chifley and Arthur Calwell, to name a few. Nowhere is the betrayal of the great quest of the 1890s more evident than in the words and actions of the present Prime Minister. Which of the great Laborites of the last hundred years would pour scorn on his fellow Australians by referring to them as scrubbers from the west? No-one. I believe all would regard the interests of Australia as being of much greater importance than their own self-pursuit for power. No previous leader was so lacking in understanding of his own society that he would so callously have engineered a depression and thrown a million people onto the unemployment scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Prime Minister openly boasts about these good figures. During Question Time he claims that we are heartless. Who can imagine John Curtin so blatantly coveting the trappings of middle-class respectability that he would pour scorn on those Australians in the electorate with whom he grew up? A person of Curtin's stature and integrity would be sickened and disgusted by the hollow promises and egotistical tone of the One Nation statement. Of course, in reality, One Nation has nothing whatsoever to do with securing a prosperous future for this nation and its people; it has nothing to do with reducing our foreign indebtedness, making us more competitive, restoring employment opportunities or dealing with the chronic structural problems that so impede economic progress. It is a statement about one thing, and one thing only: the retention of the Prime Minister's job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the inevitable historical comparisons are drawn, this pretender to the highest office in this land will be judged and will be found wanting. History will detail that in 16 economic statements he never got it right. History will detail how he destroyed the prospects of over a quarter of a million families in Australia. In my electorate of Dunkley the Prime Minister will be found wanting by the 7,272 registered unemployed, 200 of whom have joined this unhappy army since the release of the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the young people trapped in the educational institutions know that when the inevitable day of reckoning arrives, there will be no jobs anyway. They have been gratified by the Prime Minister's concern for their future, I don't think! Having ensured their effective exclusion from the labour market by the rent-seeking thuggery of the Swanston Street Soviet, this Government is condemning a generation to the humiliation and despair of a world of welfare and dependence. For them, this will be a world in which they do not have the freedom to exchange their labour for a fair price or to take charge of their own lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clyde Cameron, a former Labor Minister, has repeatedly stated that he regrets having allowed youth wages to increase to the point where many have been excluded from the work force. It will be a world where increasingly their every change of status, educational records, deposits in bank accounts, medical history, taxation records, and other private and sensitive information, will be available to nosy bureaucrats, obsessed with the interminable form filling and ever-expanding data bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the demented rhetoric of the One Nation statement, we have seen that Senator Walsh&mdash;whose comments ought to be compulsory reading in universities, especially those of the Dawkins variety&mdash;has exposed the real agenda of the education mafia. In discussing the question of the so-called unmet demand for tertiary places, Senator Walsh rightly raises some very fundamental questions about the purpose of tertiary education and the number of people who have the intellectual ability to complete such courses. In reflecting on these crucial matters in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The demand for university places is being fed by poor youth employment prospects, aggravated by the recession, and the much larger proportion which now completes high school is also probably related to poor employment prospects. Over the past 10 years high school `retention rates' (ie, those completing high school) have doubled to almost 70 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One consequence of this huge increase in retention rates is that today's average high school graduate has less ability to complete a university course. They are, however, encouraged to try. The current system makes no attempt to maintain an ongoing objective minimum university entry standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many academics and university administrators know that. A few even have the moral courage to say so. At the very least politicians should support them when they do.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the Government's education policy! The Dawkins legacy will live for decades. So much for its concern for young people! So much for its commitment to excellence and the clever country! On page 57 of the One Nation statement we are told that in 1992-93 the taxpayer will be providing $49m for 10,000 prevocational training places in TAFE colleges. To quote from One Nation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These courses will provide training opportunities . . . for young people who have been unable to obtain jobs and who are at risk of entering long term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>What an admission of culpability. Who seriously believes that such measures will do anything for the hapless recipient of more training courses? Training for what, one might ask. In case the Prime Minister is not aware, youth have been deliberately priced out of the labour market, and no amount of so-called training will get them back into it. In my electorate of Dunkley youth unemployment is at least 60 per cent and in some areas it is more like 70 per cent. Precisely what kind of jobs does the Prime Minister and the bureaucracy believe these young people will actually get? The sad reality is that there are virtually no jobs for young people. Even university graduates are finding it hard to get work. For end-of-year apprentices the outlook is just as gloomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having presided over the de-industrialisation of Australia, does the Prime Minister seriously believe there will be employment opportunities for skilled tradesmen in the future? The greenies and the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) are doing their best to destroy our great mining industry, while their overt hostility to industrial development of any kind has halted most major projects in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members should look at the pitiful number of major projects proceeding in the country at the moment. The One Nation statement has been widely condemned&mdash;and rightly so. It is little more than an unfunded way of pouring millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds into already featherbedded industries. It is all borrowed money. Surely it is about time that Australia tried to pay its way and stand on its own financial feet, so that we become an nation independent of international financiers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister comes into this House every sitting day claiming the credit for whatever is right in the economy and blaming everyone else for the failures of the past nine year. However, despite what he says, the situation is slowly deteriorating. Honourable members should look at my home State of Victoria. Official statistics reveal an unemployment rate of over 11 per cent. Most commentators believe it is probably more like 18 per cent. In the electorate of Dunkley it is at least 25 per cent. The effects of the Nissan collapse and the continued failure of so many businesses are yet to be felt. Let us look at the record of the Prime Minister himself. It is worse than that of any senior Minister in the nation's history. Let us look at his promises and remember his forecasts. Eight years ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tonight I am proud to be able to tell the Australian people that we now have strong economic growth, many more jobs, a substantial fall in inflation and declining interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>In his 1987 Budget Speech, he claimed:</PARA>

<PARA>Two years later foreign debt passed $100 billion and the news from Canberra was still phoney:</PARA>

<PARA>Well, Mr Prime Minister, as the Duke of Wellington once said, `If you believe that, you will believe anything'. But if the Prime Minister does not believe me, he should come and see for himself. He should come to Dunkley and see the people whose lives he has wrecked by the recession we had to have, and the depression we did not want. He should come down to Dunkley and see the unemployed youth, with resentment and defeat stamped all over them. He should come down to Dunkley and see the empty shops and idle factories. He should come down to Dunkley and spend a day with the Brotherhood of St Laurence or behind the counter at the Department of Social Security. He should come and see the depression of the 1990s at first hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1983 through to this One Nation statement, the Prime Minister has got it wrong&mdash;so wrong it would be laughable if it were not so tragic. It is quite obvious that he has not learnt from his mistakes. Maybe he cannot learn; maybe he can only abuse and bully. That could explain much of his behaviour. Maybe he is just one of T.S.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As John Stone reflected in his 1984 Shann Memorial Lecture entitled `1929 and All That', the experiences of history can be most illuminating, especially with respect to economic catastrophes like depressions. Now that the Prime Minister has suddenly discovered history&mdash;or is it that he has discovered a speech writer with a PhD in history&mdash;he might consider studying a previous depression. If that proves too difficult, he might care to refer to Mr Stone's address published in the October 1984 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>. Better still, perhaps his advisers might care to reflect on some of the more salient features of the last depression.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me warm to this theme. The honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) raised the question of youth employment and youth training. He and I both know that one of the most important reasons&mdash;perhaps the most important reason&mdash;why there are simply not enough jobs for young people in Australia today is that we do not have the same sort of manufacturing, production-line approach to jobs that there once was. We simply do not have those jobs which we once had in the railways or on the factory floor, as storemen and packers, street sweepers and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have, and we will never have again, the situation of days gone by when it was possible for a 14-year-old or a 15-year-old to get a job without undergoing training. The only solution to the problem of jobs for youth is through training. In fact, the best signal of a healthy economy is a well trained group of young people. The honourable member should not misrepresent the case of youth unemployment; rather, he should analyse what it is in the economy which needs to be fixed or better understood. I am talking about the sort of money that One Nation has promised, and delivered, in terms of training for youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to some of the remarks that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made yesterday in a speech at the opening of a forum for youth training and employment. I also want to look at an idea raised by the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Peter Hollingworth, who I think has responded in the wrong way to the problem of youth employment, as has the honourable member for Dunkley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said yesterday that we have to pour a great deal of money into the technical and further education system. We will do that, either in conjunction with the State systems&mdash;which fund 90 per cent of TAFEs&mdash;or against them. I do not care that much, to tell you the truth; but we must pour more money into that sector of training. The One Nation statement has already started that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has a yearning to the effect that if we cannot do anything else then why do we not just produce dead-end jobs? Do honourable members remember that? The honourable member for Bennelong said, `Look, why don't we recreate the jobs whereby you go and sweep the streets and clean the factory floors?'. It is no use looking backwards. The sorts of jobs that will be, and are being, produced every day in Australia are jobs which require great skills. There is no use suggesting that there is an alternative, that we can all go out there and, as Archbishop Hollingworth said, have a community service program for youth whereby all young people of a particular age should go out&mdash;and he does not say it should be compulsory, but he does imply this&mdash;and work for a year as volunteers in order to receive the dole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither treating youth as a subclass or an underclass of the total number of people seeking jobs, nor going back and trying to recreate the jobs that will never reappear in the Australian economy are solutions. Archbishop Peter Hollingworth&mdash;decent person; wrong idea in this case&mdash;and the honourable member for Bennelong both fail to understand that we have to lift our performance in terms of training, and One Nation is directed at that particular point of view. Ross Gittins made the point&mdash;and this was quoted by the Prime Minister yesterday&mdash;that if we cannot do better than the creation of dead-end jobs there will not be much hope for the rest of us. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An economy in which there is a great demand for unskilled workers is an economy at the bottom of the pile in the international division of labour; one with a low standard of living, producing low value, labour-intensive goods and watching the nations with cleverer, better-equipped workers pass it by.</PARA>
<PARA>He is right. I know and the honourable member knows that we have failed to produce significant numbers of those sorts of jobs. But at least we ought to get the analysis right and then follow it up. The money needs to go towards training for skills. It is no use suggesting that the problem is other than that. The November economic statement of last year also addressed this very question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of progress has this Government made in that direction? I will cite some of the figures. The Prime Minister, in his speech yesterday, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has never been a group of school leavers in Australia with higher levels of formal education than the group now entering the labour market. In the last decade the proportion of young people completing secondary schooling has doubled&mdash;from 35% in 1981 to 70% in 1991.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is brilliant. He continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our higher education system compares well with the OECD average. In 1992 around 500,000 Australians are participating in higher education, an increase of over 120,000 students since 1987&mdash;or the equivalent of 12 new universities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By 1994, we will have increased the total number of Commonwealth-funded university places by 50% since 1983. Over the 1992-1994 triennium, the Government plans to spend a total of $13 billion on higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can see these changes reflected in the education and labour market profile of young people. In the mid 1960s nearly six in ten 15-19 year olds had a full-time job; by the early 1990s, this stood at less than one in three. Less than one in three were full-time students in the mid 1960s; now six in ten are.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1992, 117,000 of our 1.3 million teenagers were seeking full-time jobs. One in ten young people is unemployed&mdash;which is actually 32,000 less than the number seeking jobs in April 1983 in the last recession.</PARA>
<PARA>Our goal is not simply to keep young people busy and off the streets, but to make sure that they are sufficiently trained to take advantage of the jobs that are appearing which require skilled labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to say, `Well, we have not got the jobs'. We know that. We know there are insufficient numbers of jobs. But we do not stop the effort in training. Those opposite have already stated in their Fightback package that they would cut back on the level of training; that they do not regard it as a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take up the question of Peter Hollingworth, who has a very high profile and is held in very high regard in the welfare sector. I am afraid his statements were very misplaced yesterday when he said he wanted to establish what he called a community service program for youth. I want to read the response by Margaret Bell&mdash;an Australian who is the World President of the International Association for Volunteer Effort&mdash;who today strongly criticised Archbishop Hollingworth's proposal, which she described as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . exclusive, dangerous and potentially linked to receipt of benefit.</PARA>
<PARA>His idea was that a young unemployed person could gain personal development and training through a year's community service in environment, sport, recreation, culture, youth welfare and local organisations. This apparently full time community work, whilst not explicitly a condition of the receipt of unemployment benefits, at least would carry with it that sense of work for the dole. I caution Archbishop Hollingworth that he should not go down that track. To establish a special scheme for youth is to set them apart. He describes youth unemployed as an under-class. There is nothing better designed to maintain the notion of unemployed youth as an under class than a special scheme for that youth under class, whereby young people volunteer to work for a year in return for the dole. Whilst a number of people in the community have approached me from time to time with this sort of concept, in the end all it does is put a label on a particular class of individual in the community, and it does not train them in the skills that are absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I canvass those in the welfare sector who from time to time think that is a great response to youth unemployment. It is not. I certainly counsel the honourable member for Bennelong, who says that producing dead-end jobs&mdash;that is, returning to the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;is some sort of solution to youth unemployment. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see essentially one of the Opposition's responses to youth. Not only are those opposite not all that interested in training youth, but also they want to tax the food out of their mouths. Let me raise the question of the GST, the consumption tax. </PARA>

A number of countries have chosen to have a GST, but even in Margaret Thatcher's England she had the decency to have a GST which was not applied to food at the punitive rate at which it was applied to other goods. If we run through a number of examples, we see that Austria has a standard rate of VAT of 20 per cent but the rate on food is only 10 per cent; Belgium has a standard rate of VAT at 19 per cent, but on food only 6 per cent; Canada has a Federal GST&mdash;it has a State one as well&mdash;at 7 per cent, but a zero rate for basic groceries. But a number of countries, such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and our dear friends in New Zealand, rate food exactly the same as any commodity for VAT. In Denmark there is a 22 per cent standard rate for VAT, and 22 per cent on food also. That is disgraceful!  France has an 18.6 per cent standard rate of VAT but, thank goodness, on food it is only 5.5 per cent; Germany, 14 per cent standard rate, 7 per cent on food; Greece, 16 per cent standard rate, 6 per cent on food; Hungary, 25 per cent&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but those opposite do not differentiate; that is the problem. Hungary&mdash;this is aptly named&mdash;has a 25 per cent standard rate and a zero rate for food. That is an acknowledgment of the ability to fiddle the system, that is, pick and choose between the goods and services that perhaps ought to be more generously treated by tax&mdash;which is what we do under our present system. Those opposite want to turn that around and make sure that they make jewellery and fast cars cheaper but make food more expensive. Essentially, a VAT is nothing more than a flat rate of income tax. That is what the Opposition wants to do. It wants to take the progressive nature of taxation out of the system, to the extent that it can. It will substitute one tax for another, but in doing so it will be sending out signals that certain goods will be cheaper and certain other goods will be dearer. There are some beautiful examples as we run through these other countries, which have said, `Hey, that's not the right thing to do; that's immoral. If we are going to impose a VAT, at least we will tax at a much lower rate basic food items'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Ireland, which has a 25 per cent VAT, there is a zero VAT on food; Italy has an 18 per cent standard VAT, 4 per cent on food; Japan has only a 3 per cent VAT, but food is exempt; Luxembourg has a 12 per cent VAT, but the rate on food is only 6 per cent; and our dear friends in New Zealand&mdash;the purists, with the pure model that the Opposition wants to introduce&mdash;have 12 1/2 per cent right across the board. The Netherlands, more sensible I guess, if one of these ridiculous taxes has to be used, has an 18 1/2 per cent standard VAT, but only 6 per cent on food. In Norway, that high taxing country, it is 20 per cent right across the board, including food; Portugal has 17 per cent as a standard rate, zero on food; Spain, a 12 per cent standard rate, 6 per cent for basic foodstuffs; and Sweden, another high taxing country, a 23.46 per cent VAT right across the board, food included&mdash;and what an awful place to live in Sweden must be these days. Switzerland has no VAT&mdash;it knocked it off in a referendum in 1977. It is good to see that referenda do not get up in other places as well. Turkey is very sensible: whilst it has a VAT at 10 per cent, the rate for basic foodstuffs is only 3 per cent. The United Kingdom, which has a 17 1/2 per cent VAT, has a zero rate for food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am saying is that if those opposite want to have a flat rate tax, which is what VATs and GSTs are all about, they should note that a number of nations that have introduced them have at least held on to one principle: they make sure they do not tax basic food items, which account for a very high percentage of the income of poorer people, at the same rate as they tax other goods. Our tax regime presently has that amount of sensitivity in it whereby the people wealthy enough to buy expensive products are taxed more highly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) is starting to believe his own rhetoric in relation to the Fightback package. I well recall his own leader advocating a similar option in 1985. I draw to his attention the key element that he is arguing here&mdash;that the goods and services tax be applied selectively. He is drawing it to our attention that some countries do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that one of the key elements of the Fightback package is that we do not exempt any items. One of the difficulties that those other countries have is making the distinction between those items. That has been one of the failures in those countries that the honourable member has mentioned in terms of the application of the GST at various rates. The increase in paperwork and definition of the particular items makes the system almost unworkable. His whole case falls down as a result of the evidence in the other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the former Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), stamped the country and advocated a similar proposition to that which the Opposition is now advocating with clarity and with an understanding of what advantages it will give to Australia. I think the Parliamentary Secretary's observations are without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholesale sales tax is a ramshackle tax, as everyone knows, and almost impossible to administer. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) have now introduced yet another set of wholesale sales tax arrangements that nobody can understand, and nobody will understand them until October 1994 when we get rid of the whole lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is an ageing document. It does not come to the challenges of the 1990s, with the nation facing a debt of $150 billion. I notice that other speakers have drawn to the attention of the House today the fact that our national debt continues to escalate. Unemployment is at record levels. This draws my attention to the great Jack Lang, who was the mentor of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). During his time in the Parliament, the numbers of unemployed were as great as they are now under his protege, the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement is trying to regain political momentum. The original estimate of the blow-out was $4.7 billion. We know today that it is nearly $9.3 billion. That is the estimated figure; all of us on this side of the House will be interested to see what the final blow-out figure of the Budget prepared last August will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement portrays a remarkable growth rate of 4.75 per cent&mdash;nearly 5 per cent&mdash;in the next 12 months. That is remarkable when one thinks that this dramatic increase in growth is going to start on 1 July. In the next 12 months that will be the order of things in Australia; the economy will have this sort of upturn and there will be a turnaround in economic activity, confidence and the ability of Australians to make money and show profits. The latest ABS figures indicate that the gross domestic product is increasing only by around 1.5 per cent per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other failure of the One Nation statement is that it does not address the problem of the industrial relations of this country. I will talk more about this. It has added just another 1,000 pages, as I mentioned to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), to the wholesale sales tax package. Members of the accounting profession, having spent three days reading it, cannot understand this. That is just one example that has been drawn to my attention. That is the state of play: the Government, while trying to simplify a tax regime, is making it more complicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw to the attention of the House some features of the One Nation statement, a statement which the Prime Minister spent the first couple of months of his prime ministership preparing. He made no policy pronouncements and it was regarded as a benchmark of the Keating Government. It spent $2.3 billion of extra money on capital projects, and the rate of return of these projects would have to be questioned in the shorter term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting factors to emerge from the polls is that the One Nation statement represents no flag and no Queen, no monarchy. That is the message that the Prime Minister has been able to convey to the Australian people. So much for the One Nation mini-Budget statement. That is all it is, a mini-Budget statement of the Government's intention to spend more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me compare that very briefly with the Fightback package. All honourable members in this House would be aware of the very positive nature of that. In the Fightback package, there is the abolition of seven taxes; a 30 per cent flat rate of income tax, which I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be very happy about, on incomes between $20,000 and $50,000; an 8 per cent rise in pensions; and a $20 billion cut in business costs around the nation. The Opposition concedes the point that a 15 per cent goods and services tax will be applied to those services, but in the final analysis we know that the cost will go up by only about 4.4 per cent; in fact, the Government's own estimates suggest 3.6 per cent. All those wholesale sales taxes of 10, 20 and 30 per cent will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me continue to emphasise that position of the Fightback package compared with the One Nation statement. It is a clear plan: it cuts taxes, it is pro-business, it is pro-jobs, it is pro-saving and it is pro-investment. It is a 700-page carefully detailed document of what the Hewson Government will do when it reaches the Government benches in the very near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the industrial relations issue which members of this House have been debating in recent days and, in particular, the APPM issue. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), yesterday in this House gave a stirring speech, which demonstrated his understanding of the issue and the way in which the Opposition would handle the industrial relations matters involved in that particular dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government, the State Government and the ACTU President, Mr Martin Ferguson, have tried to get involved in the act. It is the last-ditch stand for those particular people to try to save the union movement from slow and gradual decline in Australia. The fact of the matter is that the management is prepared to negotiate with the union movement about pay, long service leave, conditions, overtime, all those sorts of things, but it is not prepared to negotiate with the unions about the outdated work practices in that particular plant. That is the position of management, and it is completely untrue to suggest that the company has not been prepared to negotiate on those issues. That is what the public relations people and the President of the ACTU would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key point that I want to re-emphasise is my total agreement with the shadow Minister that the matter of industrial relations, in this particular instance and other major disputes, is a matter between management and the workers on the shop floor. No amount of interference by the members of this Parliament, by the Prime Minister, by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook), or by any other senior official will help this particular dispute. It is time that we in Australia realised that disputes are between the workers and management and need to be sorted out at that level. The former President of the ACTU, Mr Hawke, used to ride up on his white charger and solve a dispute at the last minute&mdash;or think he did. Those sorts of attitudes are no longer relevant to the way we run our industrial relations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally endorse the shadow Minister's stand and suggest that all future disputes be handled by the participants and not be interfered with by members of the Government, the Opposition and the President of the ACTU. The shadow Minister was very clear on his particular role in this whole matter. The responsibility for industrial relations is at the shop floor level and that is where negotiations should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just mention the independent contractor suggestion put forward by the Government. I have had more representations on this issue than any other issue this year. A number of independent contractors, in my electorate and elsewhere around Australia, are concerned that this Government, under the proposals put forward by the One Nation statement and other legislation, is going to force independent contractors to come under award and union control. This would mean that 84 per cent of those persons working on both small and large building sites around Australia would be forced under union control. The last-ditch stand of this Government is to force people into trade union membership. Think of all those truckies moving down the Hume Highway. As independent contractors they, too, would be forced to come under the control of the union movement. The outcome of this particular approach&mdash;and I notice that the Government is having second thoughts about it&mdash;is that a new home of $110,000, which is the average price, would be increased by at least $15,000 if the home building industry were forced to use unionised labour at all times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement, a memorable statement about industrial relations, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of (labour market) reform has now switched from the industry and award level to the individual workplace to generate the productivity gains necessary for Australia to reap the gains necessary for Australia to reap the full benefits from general market liberalisation, structural adjustment and other microeconomic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>What wonderful high-sounding words about the change in approach by this Labor Government!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it has not changed at all. In fact, it has corrupted the idea of enterprise bargaining and, as I observed recently, it is a hybrid type of industrial relations arrangement. It is neither fully centralist nor largely decentralised. It is neither one nor the other. The only way to go is to totally disband the centralised wage fixing system, which has taken place in New Zealand with startling results, such as in the case as the Comalco firm that I referred to on another occasion in this House. The improvements in productivity, quality control, output and labour relationships have been dramatic and startling. In the case of that company, the arrangements were conducted at the work floor level, where management and the work force got together to improve output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gradualist approach favoured by the Government, because it is not really game to face up to the issues of industrial relations and dramatic changes, means that we are not addressing the competitive position of Australia in the world. According to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, foreign ownership of Australian enterprises has moved from 33 per cent to 50 per cent. Foreigners are now moving in to take over our enterprises because they know they will make the changes at some later date under the new Hewson government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be aware that we now live in a global economy. We have to have the advances in transport and communications that mean that we are competing with other nations. We have to have those activities on world best practice so that we are competing efficiently with everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the superannuation proposals that have been put forward in the One Nation statement. Again, the Government is having second thoughts about this. The Prime Minister has advocated these compulsory superannuation arrangements here in this Parliament day after day without thinking through their implications for employers and for the number of jobs that might be done away with because of the high impact of compulsory superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the employers be totally responsible for superannuation payments? Why should the employees not make a contribution to their long term superannuation? Why is this Government forcing, by way of legislation, superannuation payments on all employers around Australia? The CAI suggests that 60,000 jobs will be lost because of compulsory superannuation. So, by the Government's very act here in this Parliament, by forcing superannuation on large and small employers, between 60,000 and 100,000 jobs could be lost over the next couple of years&mdash;at a time when we have one million Australians unemployed. So much for the One Nation statement, which is the basis of the Keating policy position for 1992. It is wrongly based, it is a big spending document and it provides no plan for the future for the Keating Government. The Fightback package will be the way to go. </PARA>

This idea the Opposition has of what families do with their money is very wrong. Most families I know spent the money very wisely on their children, and I know were grateful for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This one-off payment was accompanied by an increase in family payments across the board. Of course, since the One Nation statement we have also created a family payment, as opposed to a number of different family payments. That money will make it easier for families to budget and will go directly to the carers of children, that is, mostly women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement also included measures to create jobs now and into the future. As I have indicated, many jobs are already being created, although not as many as we would like at this stage. The statement also contained personal income tax cuts&mdash;without recourse to a consumption tax. And people will benefit from those income tax cuts. The people at the lower end of the income scale who are not included in the income tax cuts will benefit from changes in the family allowance structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement included incentives to work and increase productivity. This is most important, and an area in which the Government has taken a great interest since its initial and subsequent elections. We do believe in micro-economic reform. We do not believe in disrupting the work force through strikes and confrontation. We believe in negotiation, discussion and consultation with workers and employers to achieve the types of micro-economic reform that this country needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement also included support for Australian products and ideas. That proposal cannot be overstated. It is an area where many people in Australia get frustrated. They see companies leaving Australia, not because of the labour costs, but because they feel they are not getting recognition for their ideas and products. That was an area that the Prime Minister touched on as an important area in his statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement also included specific help for business to invest and to export.

He is very determined that the recovery upon which Australia has now embarked will not stall for want of effort on the Government's part. On Sunday, he reiterated in no uncertain terms&mdash;and very publicly&mdash;the Federal Government's determination to take the vocational education agenda right up to the States and to ensure that TAFE is not left as a second class cousin in the tertiary education system. This proposal offers improved access to those young people who do not want to go to university but who would rather pursue education with a more vocational orientation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that people understand that this position exists and that a number of youngsters have opted for university education because they think that that is what their parents, teachers or others in society think they should do. When I was involved in the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training one of the reports that we presented was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Restless Years.</EMPHASIS> In that inquiry we found that there were a large number of young people who would have preferred, had the options been available to them, to have pursued a vocational education from very early in high school. What we can do as a Federal government is to ensure that places are available in TAFE for them. The importance of the Federal Government's undertaking in this regard, both in One Nation and since, is that more funding will be available for the expansion of the TAFE sector; and better, more uniform credentials will result from the studies that people do in the TAFE sector. </PARA>

This proposal will lead to significant micro-economic reform in that industry and has the support, I believe, of the majority of Australians. Indeed, it was an area of reform that many Australians were advocating at an earlier stage when these proposals were first being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the sale of 100 per cent of shares in the merged airline with the retention of a golden share to protect areas of national interest and prestige still requires ratification by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;it is not my preferred position, although I accept it may well be the preferred position of others on my side of the House&mdash;there is no doubt that this proposal has generated a great deal of interest and provided a signal of positiveness to the business world and the community at large as to the Government's intentions. I will leave it to the Party to decide whether we will have 49 per cent or 100 per cent ownership. Nevertheless, it is a bold proposal which is overdue. The merger is significant and the proposal to float the shares will also be significant and, I believe, welcomed in the community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, the Liberal-National Party Fightback proposals impose a 15 per cent consumption tax on everything. I cannot marry this consumption tax with any claims by the Opposition that its proposals will create jobs, nor can I see that its proposals could possibly have an anti-inflationary effect, only an inflationary effect, when our Government and indeed the people of Australia have undergone so much to ensure that we have a low inflation outcome and we can now reap the benefit of that outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fightback proposals also cut sole parents off benefits when the youngest child is 12 years of age. How can it possibly marry this with its feigned concern for the welfare of children? Perhaps `marry' is the key word in that sentence. I recall this particular proposal being raised by the Opposition in a previous election manifesto and causing great concern amongst sole parents in my electorate. No doubt that concern will still be evident this time around and people will understand that it is a very bad proposal. People with 12-year-old children, be they male or female, do not wish to be in the work force if they are not already in the work force, and they certainly do not want to be forced to go to work because they are not eligible for benefit. I think sole parents, be they men or women, do a very good job of raising families in the community; it is a very difficult job. They would certainly be eligible for any benefit that they may apply for. Twelve years of age is very young for a child to be left alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback also proposes to cut the self-employment assistance programs, which I again think is a retrograde step, given the importance of these programs to people's self-esteem when on unemployment benefits and given the fact that in my electorate people have commented to me that they have been able to support themselves after being on one of these programs, because they have had the time and the assistance of government people to develop a proposal for employment. Obviously, there is a need to continue this sort of assistance for people who have an idea or a craft that they can develop with a little help, a little expertise in financial matters and some assistance in drawing up a plan for their business and in developing a niche market. Obviously, identifying and developing that niche market is a very important aspect of any self-employment proposal. These assistance programs are very valuable. I cannot understand how the Opposition could be proposing to be supportive of business and also be proposing to cut these sorts of assistance programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also wants to cut unemployed people off benefits after nine months.

Interference in the back room of the APPM dispute has been a feature which has only just come to the fore, but it is one where a particular hypocritical bent is being shown by the Opposition. It has criticised the Government for its attempts to openly resolve the dispute and has been saying that there is no role for government in the dispute.

She says that there is no consumption tax on food and clothing. I do not know what she thinks payroll tax, sales tax, fuel excise tax and all these types of things are. On clothing there is a consumption tax equivalent of 35 to 40 per cent due to the tariff on clothing alone. This side of the House has pledged to get rid of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The country at this stage is in a hell of a mess. We have an overseas debt which rose again yesterday from $145 billion to $148 billion, which is a 2.4 per cent increase for the quarter. On an annualised basis, that is a 9.6 per cent increase, which is a horrific figure to contemplate. There are one million people unemployed, which is 10 per cent of the general population, and 30-plus per cent of the youth of this country. There are record bankruptcies everywhere. We have members on the Government side getting up and trumpeting the One Nation statement. They may have made the statement, but nothing in the country has changed. Things go on as badly as ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures introduced in the One Nation statement were supposed to create 800,000 jobs over time. That is a very interesting figure. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, said he personally had created one million or so jobs while he was in office. We worked out that it was costing Australia $70,000 to create each job. Under this One Nation statement, if an extra 800,000 jobs are created, on the projections of the blow-out in the overseas debt it will cost $109,000 to create each of those jobs. It is very easy to create jobs by using somebody else's money; it is a different matter to create them yourself. The upwards of two million jobs which we say in the GST-Fightback package will be created before this decade finishes will not be created by government. Government will not have anything to do with it. In that sense, they will be created by business. Businesses will be creating the jobs because government will be getting off their back and allowing them to create the jobs themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to speak about the GST-Fightback package. It is not just about taxation; it is about a whole host of portfolios, the main one of which will be industrial relations, which will give a great impetus to getting this country going again. I always cite the SPC canning factory at Shepparton in Victoria as an example. It was going broke as a result of bad management decisions and bad industrial practices. The management said to the workers, `We will all be out of a job in a few months unless we come to our senses'. They sat down and negotiated an enterprise agreement together. John Halfpenny, bless his heart, heard about it and managed to water it down. Even with that watered-down agreement, there has been a 35 per cent lift in productivity and the company has gone from a $12m loss last year to a $6m profit. There is some hope for that company now, as a result of that enterprise agreement. If that was not in place, no doubt that company would have been shut down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That example shows that although people are despairing now, the potential is out there for dramatic lifts in productivity. They will not come from the Government necessarily doing anything at all, but, quite the reverse, from the Government doing nothing but getting out of it and letting the management and workers solve the problems themselves at the workplace without having to trudge off tugging the forelock to the trade unions or the Industrial Relations Commission in Melbourne. That shows what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at the Government's own figures in this great volume&mdash;it must have 1,000 or 1,500 pages&mdash;which contains the briefing papers that came from Treasury as a result of the quarter of a million dollar computer model that was set up by a previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), that was going to destroy the Fightback package. The document says quite clearly how much each industry is going to benefit by as a result of taking into account only a portion of the GST-Fightback package. This table only takes into account abolishing the payroll tax, abolishing the fuel excise and abolishing the wholesale sales tax. We know there are many other benefits to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document says that agriculture alone will benefit by $1,025m. If we divide that into the number of farms in Australia, it works out at $160 per farm per week for the rest of their lives&mdash;an amazing figure. These are Treasury's own figures. The document says that the mining industry will benefit by $677m; manufacturing will benefit by $5,370m; and services industries will benefit by $7,722m. Think of the jobs that that will create and the businesses that that will make more profitable and will get going in Australia. I am delighted to see, by the Government's own figures, that it supports the GST-Fightback package, too, even though the Ministers themselves are not honest enough to admit it when they are talking to the media or here in the Parliament in Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a shemozzle of a system in the country today as far as taxation is concerned. We have only to look at the system as a whole. If we had to pick three things that are wrong with the taxation system in Australia today, we would say that the taxes we pay are far too high, the taxation system is far too complicated and the tax mix is wrong: we pay far too many direct taxes&mdash;taxes on earnings; as opposed to indirect taxes&mdash;taxes on consumption. We intend to lower the level of tax that we pay, to simplify the whole system and to change the tax mix. Essentially, that is what the GST package is all about. It does all those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The easiest way to envisage that is to look at the wholesale sales tax system that we have in this country today. We have five different levels of sales tax: a zero level, a 10 per cent level, a 15 per cent level, a 20 per cent level, and a 30 per cent level. There is no rhyme or reason why any commodity falls within any particular level. If we went out into the street and asked people to explain the rationale of it, they would probably say something along the lines of, `Luxury goods are in the 30 per cent level and the basic staples of life are in the zero per cent level'. If that was the case, we could see some logic to it. But that is not the case. For example, on simple things such as the wristwatch on my arm we pay a 30 per cent tax, and the clock radio we turn on in bed in the morning to listen to the market reports before we get up attracts a 30 per cent level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the scale, things such as pornographic magazines and caviar are exempt from sales tax. Anyone who can tell me the logic of that&mdash;the logic of having one tax on ornaments and another tax on souvenirs, or one tax on towels that are made out of cloth and another tax on towels that are made out of paper, or one tax on strawberry-flavoured Quik and another tax on chocolate-flavoured Quik&mdash;is a better person than I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We intend to abolish sales tax altogether and replace it with a tax at one level right across the board so that it is honest, visible and simple. It is something that close to 50 countries have done around the world. I think 22 out of the 24 OECD countries have done it. There has been no greater advocate of this tax in this country than the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He was quite right back in 1985 when he spoke glowingly on numerous occasions in favour of a tax of this type to replace the taxes we have now. I am sure he still believes that, even though he speaks differently of it today for political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are putting a GST of 15 per cent in place and we are abolishing seven taxes. We are lowering three taxes and we are delivering a host of other benefits, such as increasing pensions by 8 per cent and doubling the family allowance. It is the best system we could put in place, taken from the best features of all the countries in the world. When we have this in place, we will have the best GST system in the whole world. Some countries have done it wrongly, such as England and Canada, but they have still benefited from the tax. New Zealand was the second last country to bring it in. It brought it in in a very proper manner, but we have even improved on that, I am pleased to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the taxes we are abolishing&mdash;which I as a country member am particularly pleased to talk about&mdash;is the fuel excise tax. There was a 6c a litre tax on fuel when the present Prime Minister became Treasurer in 1983. He talked about petrol bowsers being tax collection officers. I notice that when he left the treasury bench that tax had quadrupled from 6c a litre to 26c a litre. We intend to abolish that and replace it with a GST. For example, in a country town where petrol is selling for 76c a litre, if we abolish the 26c a litre excise, the price of petrol will fall from 76c a litre to 50c a litre. The 15 per cent GST, in round figures, would be about 7c a litre. The petrol would then rise to 57c a litre. In other words, if we are using the petrol for our own <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>private use to drive away for a holiday or to travel around town to see our friends, we are going to have a cut in fuel excise of 19c a litre. In a 60-litre tank, for the average car, that is an $11.40 benefit. For people in business, the GST costs will be totally refunded&mdash;as all GST costs are&mdash;so they will benefit by a full 26c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I was talking to a small businessman in Nyngan. His name is John Richter, and he runs a stock transport company with only two trucks. On the abolition of the fuel excise alone, he will benefit by $65,000 a year. If we take a 30-tonne truck carrying stock from Cobar to Dubbo, the benefit one way on that journey will be $120. If we take into account all the taxes that we are abolishing, for a longer distance from, say, Wanaaring in my electorate to Dubbo, on a one way trip with a 30-tonne stock truck the benefit will be $241. The abolition of the payroll tax is particularly beneficial to country people. I had Roger Fletcher, from the Dubbo abattoir, in my office the other day. He said, `What are you going to do for us?'. I asked, `How many people do you employ?'. He said, `I employ 520.' I said, `That's interesting. How much payroll tax would you pay?'. He said, `I pay $1.3m'. I said, `We are abolishing it'. He sat there stunned. One industry in one country town is going to benefit by $1.3m just from the abolition of one tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forbes abattoir is in an interesting financial position at the moment and would have difficulty in keeping its doors open if it did not have overseas ownership. It employs 300 people. The wages that go into the Forbes district at this stage are equivalent to $8m. If that place had to close, the loss of those wages being spent in the town of Forbes and surrounding places would put businesses in that area in a dire position. But by the abolition of the payroll tax alone the Forbes abattoir will be better off by $563,000. That is an enormous advantage in securing jobs and keeping the abattoir open. I understand that it kills about 47,000 beasts a year, most of which go to export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As businesses and people in the street hear more and more of the factual, genuine detail of this package, they are embracing it more and more. They are very excited about it. They are agreeing with what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said when he was Treasurer back in 1985: that we should have a tax of this type. It will make business more profitable, it will create two million real jobs by the end of the decade, and it will be particularly advantageous to disadvantaged people. A pensioner couple will get an extra $40-plus in their fortnightly cheque, and people with disabilities will receive, over and above what is in their cheques, a non-taxable $45.

In early April, in my own electorate on the central coast of New South Wales, the family payment was made to the 27,000 families which receive family allowance. That injected $5m into our local economy. That $5m will ensure that our local economy&mdash;local business houses, people who work in the supermarkets&mdash;gets a kick-start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even on the Gold Coast we had, I think, over $300m injected into the national economy through the payment to families.

That is a road improvement which is very important to the economic infrastructure of that part of the Sydney region. I think work on the Glebe Island Bridge has already commenced. A major bridge which is important to the road network in Sydney will be constructed, not because of the Greiner Government but because the Federal Labor Government has put in the extra money now so that jobs can be created and that economic infrastructure provided for years to come. </PARA>

This is the first government since the Whitlam Government to make a major commitment to improving the economic competitiveness of our national rail network.

It will assist in ensuring that we can get freight off our roads and back onto rail, which is where more of it should be travelling. I am sure, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of the great importance of the rail projects which are part of the One Nation statement, because I understand there is one rail project that goes through the Gold Coast.

Yesterday the Government went one step further and announced the most radical revolution ever seen in Australia's aviation industry with the decision that Qantas and Australian Airlines are to be merged. That proposal will, for the first time, allow Qantas to compete on an even footing with all the other international airlines that have a domestic base feeding into their own international systems. </PARA>

In the same way, British Airways advertises that, if we fly with it to London, it can provide us with cheap air fares around continental Europe. Because Qantas has not had a domestic base in Australia, it has not been able to compete on a fair basis with the other international carriers. It has taken this Labor Government to merge the two airlines and to ensure that Qantas does not have to fight with one arm tied behind its back. </PARA>

I have no difficulty if some of those shares are sold to one of the foreign mega-carriers, whether it be Singapore Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa, or one of the other quality international airlines. I happen to think that it is in the long term interests of Qantas to have an alliance with one of the mega-carriers that are increasingly dominating world aviation. In that sense, Qantas can have someone who can speak on its behalf and advocate in Australia's interests an expansion of Qantas's access to routes in other parts of the world. I think it will work to Qantas's advantage if a major foreign shareholder is a mega-carrier. As we all know, market forces take their place not only in other parts of the world but also in Australia. If one of the mega-carriers does not bid a high enough price, perhaps 100 per cent of Qantas will remain in Australian hands but it will be in the hands of people who might bid at a public share float in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two people have expressed some concerns to me about the proposal to sell 100 per cent of Qantas and to merge Australian and Qantas. The first criticism is that this will reduce competition in the Australian aviation industry and it will be unfair to Southern Cross Airlines which is about to relaunch Compass in a month or two. Those people seem to ignore the fact that Qantas has had an alliance with Ansett Airlines for a considerable period. All that will happen is that the strategic alliance which Qantas now has with Ansett will be transferred to a strategic alliance between Qantas and Australian Airlines. Qantas has announced that it will continue to run Australian as a separate domestic airline for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second criticism that has been made is that if we sell off Qantas how can we protect Australia's interests? The Government proposes to maintain a golden share in Qantas which will allow the Government to protect designated Australian interests such as the name, the home base of the airline and its major route structure. That should ensure that if there is any attempt to threaten these designated Australian interests the Australian Government can take action to ensure that that does not take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this is a proposal that will be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of honourable members, but it is a proposal that has been implemented only because this Labor Government has been prepared to grasp the nettle, as announced on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, and implement changes that I think will work in the interests of not only Australia's air travelling public but also both airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had another victory in the announcement of the arrangements which are to apply for pay television. In a move which I know the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who is in the House, would support, the Government has decided that no networks, nor the national broadcaster, will be allowed to participate in the consortium that will control transponders 1 to 4. The honourable member for Bass, who has a long history of supporting greater diversity in the media, on occasions, would certainly argue that the networks should not be involved in transponders 1 to 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we will find quite a rapid expansion in pay television when it is launched perhaps late next year. I understand that the satellite signal will be able to be picked up by about 95 per cent of Australians. While it may cost about the same as a video recorder for the decoding equipment and a satellite dish, I think we will find, as we did with videos, that Australians will purchase this technology very rapidly because they seem to be addicted to television, like myself and perhaps others in the House. It will not take long before pay television will be playing a very important role in providing more news, information, sport and entertainment to Australians. It has been this Government that has been prepared to take the hard decisions, to say to the networks, `No, you are not allowed to be involved in transponders 1 to 4'. In that sense we are ensuring that there is greater diversity in Australia's media. </PARA>

When the honourable member gets a bill from his local council, because it provides a garbage service, a cleaning service or some other service, there will be a 15 per cent tax on that service provided by the local council.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to receive a note in the last week or so from the Insurance Council of Australia. The Council has been given what is called exempt status, which I would have thought it would have welcomed. However, it is the reverse. The Council has demanded that a GST be applied to it. Because there will be so much complicated paperwork involved in its being an exempted industry it is demanding the Opposition to put a tax on it. If that does not demonstrate how ridiculous and how complex the Opposition's system is, I do not know what will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My prediction is that if the Opposition introduces a GST, in the unfortunate event that it is elected to government, we will see a return to the barter economy, where people will be seeking to exchange goods rather than deal in cash because they know they will be expected to charge a GST on that good or service which is exchanged.

Men and women aged between 30 and 45 with teenage children and mortgages, people who have held responsible jobs and have probably spent a long time in a particular place of work gaining credit and skill, are losing their jobs. Similar things are happening in the electorates represented by members of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight we are debating the impact on Australia of the statement made on 26 February by the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>. The Prime Minister commenced his speech on that night by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I became Prime Minister a little over two months ago I pledged to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I could muster.</PARA>
<PARA>Four to five months later we can assess how beneficial the One Nation statement and those decisions of this Government have been. In that time we have seen that, despite the promises in that statement, our domestic deficit has increased from $4.7 billion to $9.3 billion, in those few months a doubling in the loss that the nation has made. The Prime Minister said on that evening that under Labor's plan he would endeavour&mdash;I think he promised&mdash;to create 800,000 jobs. There is a commitment to get things moving, to fight unemployment and to create 800,000 new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment continues to rise, and still there is no relief for the Australian people. Having created massive unemployment, the Government continues to produce gimmick after plan, after deception, after deceit, to hoodwink the Australian people into thinking the Government is in control and managing and governing for the benefit of the people of Australia. That is not the case. A million Australians are testimony to why the Government has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I can understand why a man of your sagacity, with your distinguished career in the Parliament, would see that this is a place that you would rather be away from. Despite 10 years of claimed hard work by the Australian Labor Party, it has just put Australia in a worse position than when it first started to govern. What have those  boom  years,  those  heady years of the mates, with Bob Hawke off on fishing boats  and  travelling  the world as  a  statesman, amounted to? Complete and  absolute failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All members of the Australian Labor Party ought to be feeling that failure very sorely tonight. They ought to be feeling it in their electorates. They ought to be seeing it in the businesses that are closing, in the houses that are having to be sold, the homes and cottages that people can no longer maintain, and the kids and middle-aged people who are out of jobs with no prospect of gaining employment. That has been the result of 10 years work. The One Nation statement purports to resolve those problems. On becoming Prime Minister, the honourable member for Blaxland said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have heard the message. I know I, as Treasurer, created a problem, and now I am going to rectify it.</PARA>
<PARA>It took him eight years to create that problem, becoming first the world's best Treasurer and then the world's worst Treasurer. When he became Prime Minister he finally admitted that he had made a hash of it, but having become the general manager, he was going to put things right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the discussions in this Parliament between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then Treasurer, the now Prime Minister, when Mr Hawke sought valiantly to defend the policies of his Treasurer. He said, in metaphoric terms, `My arm is around Paul. He is my friend, and I know he would not lead Australia astray'. In fact, in the Parliament we saw the downfall of the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, brought about by the poor economic policies of the current Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the statement made in February by the Prime Minister, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, there are promises for a stronger Australia; getting things moving; and an immediate pay-out of $300m to Australian families&mdash;well warranted. But for those families it is like going to the bank manager whilst heavily in debt and being promised a loan from the bank's finance company to see them out of trouble. It is just what Australian families do not need in the long term because it puts them further into debt. As I see it, the promises made in the One Nation statement are not factored in to a calculation of where Australia stands in its economic balances of trade. They are not factored in to how Australia will balance its books or how we will pay for the massive borrowings that we have made, or how we will rectify the $148 billion trade deficit, or the deficit of $9.3 billion for the current year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody has considered that. It seems that the Australian Labor Party, while castigating the banks, is being a Shylock in its own right. It is just forcing Australian people further into debt, claiming purity at the same time. The deception and the deceit practised by the Prime Minister have created a situation where the Australian community no longer believes that deception and that deceit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the One Nation statement, the Prime Minister announced that he would return Australia to a surplus Budget by 1995-96, in a short three to four years. The first figures of that effort show that we are going further backwards. The Prime Minister has only two choices to solve that domestic deficit: to raise taxes or to cut government expenditure. He has no other options. He cannot manufacture the money; our credit ratings are not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had the decision to sell Qantas&mdash;a decision that I applaud&mdash;but, unfortunately, the proceeds of that sale, instead of paying off our debts, will just go to produce a little bubble of excitement and pay-outs for the forthcoming election and will basically be frittered away. I cannot imagine why the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) would want to bring the proceeds of that sale of Qantas&mdash;the Government claims it is $1 billion&mdash;into the Budget for other than political reasons and for reasons that are of no long term benefit to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not using the proceeds of an asset to rectify the long standing debt problem. It is not paying off the debt. Instead, the Government is just using that money to fiddle the books and to get itself through the next election. For the sale of a great asset, it will get $1 billion. Around Australia today, asset after asset is being sold. We are selling the silver; we are selling the farm. For what purpose? So that the Australian Labor Party can stay in front, so that it can appear to have the books balanced. When the facts are realised, one sees that we are sinking further and further into debt. With private investment low, the Prime Minister in the One Nation statement in February said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will take the opportunity to build railways, roads, ports, electricity grids, air terminals, waste management plants, colleges, schools&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>anything! It seems like the Government is involved in a giant auction with borrowed money from a bankrupt nation. What is the Prime Minister on about? We have seen those efforts. We have seen his endeavours in the past. They were the things that produced the circumstances that we are in now, and we are going to have more of the same. As I read on in the One Nation statement, I find that there is to be building of railways and competitive ports, as I have outlined, and a better and safer road network&mdash;all on borrowed money; all something that the nation cannot afford; all not funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of providing the jobs that will be created by these projects is massive. There is only one long term way in which we can create jobs in this nation: to allow those people in the private sector, the non-government sector, to be able to be profitable and to have satisfactory returns so that they want to expand and employ more people. The Australian taxpayer cannot go on funding forever. On one side of the equation we have the profligate attitudes, the profligate ideas, the profligate policies, of this Prime Minister. He will revolutionise the aviation industry&mdash;I have adverted to part of that in regard to the sale of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the equation is also interesting. Let us look at the way in which Compass was put down by the Australian Government, because it was unwilling to operate an effective, competitive aviation industry. The Government was content, despite its criticisms, to allow the two-airline policy to continue. One has only to read those Cabinet notes of the discussions between Ted Harris, Peter Abeles, the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and other Ministers, to realise that the plot in the pilots strike was to maintain two airlines, and the plot since then has been to retain two airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will Ansett be, given an international licence? There will be very few entrants into the field. The Government has rejuvenated Qantas. I hope Compass succeeds. But Compass should not count on too much support from this Government in gaining access to airports, in fair play between the other airlines or even in the proper application of the Trade Practices Act. The Government has some powerful friends and the Government supports those powerful friends, as we saw in the pilots strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is going to generate more power; it is putting $100m into that. In Adelaide, we are going to get the multifunction polis going. That is part of the One Nation statement. What a ridiculous project that is. If it will not work with private enterprise funding, it will not work at all. Why should the taxpayer sink money into the multifunction polis for the sake of the hide of the South Australian Government? I have visited the site; I have spoken to the operatives; and I have read widely on it. Japanese academics condemn it. They say that patriotic Australians should be most cautious before giving their support to the multifunction polis. It is a nebulous idea created on paper, backed by few with finance but by many who are prepared to say that, if the Australian taxpayer will foot the bill for the multifunction polis, they will endorse it. Of course, once they have tapped into the milch cow of the Australian taxpayer to pour more and more funds into this project, they cannot but succeed. I wonder who the beneficiaries of that project will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, what the Opposition has devised is a complete program, not a tax. It has devised a program called Fightback, which abolishes seven taxes. The total package puts $50 billion per annum, as defined by Treasury, back into the economy, back into the private sector, back into job creation. It removes taxes. It moves ahead in a substantial way in micro-economic reform. It also seeks to modify and change the workplace relationships between Australians. But, in contrast, the Government has produced the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspects of the Fightback proposal are that families and those who are elderly benefit. They are the beneficiaries of the Fightback proposal. Families, those with children, gain the most advantage from the changes. But, overall, all Australians will benefit because no-one is basically worse off. Everybody can see that there needs to be a change. Australians want a change. They do not want the fiddling and expenditure that the current Government is prepared to go on with. They need to see that hope and opportunity exist for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and our team have a plan. It is a fair plan, despite what is being said by those opposite. It is a plan that will be fair to the elderly, to those with children, to those seeking jobs, to those seeking to create jobs. It will be a plan which will give peace of mind to the Australian people because it is not radical; it is sensible and well laid out. It is the type of plan that says, `Paul Keating won't get my dollars before they go into my pocket. I, by some discretionary expenditure, will decide how and when I will pay tax'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an exciting end to a fairly pedestrian speech&mdash;talking about Fightback and what a great thing it would be. One can just imagine the coalition party room about a week ago with Andrew Robb there with a sales pitch, the slides and the glossy packets. They were all there waiting to here about Fightback and the second phase&mdash;or maybe it is the third phase. Fightback has gone over like a lead balloon out in the community. To hear those sorts of platitudes given to it by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), makes one wonder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happened to be walking past in the corridor when the coalition members were coming out with their glazed eyes and glossy pamphlets under their wings, going out to try to sell this Fightback package. We did not have to wait long to find out what was in it, because that night we saw the loaded gun, the frightened pensioner and the claims that Fightback will stop break-ins in homes. This is convoluted thinking at its worst, for sure. If the Opposition is starting to make those claims about Fightback, one has to start wondering about some of the other claims that are yet to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell, claimed that Fightback will be good for the elderly. The one thing that all people who have retired know is that they have been brought up in a regime where they have paid high income tax. The proposition now is to lower the income tax and start taxing expenditure. One does not have to be a Rhodes scholar to know that retired people or those approaching retirement have got to be affected by the worst of both worlds. During their working life they had to pay all of that income tax and, now that they have built up a nest egg, they will have it devalued by 15 per cent by what is essentially the tax on all their goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then had the hide to say that Fightback was going to create jobs. It is a pity that he did not listen to Mr Frank O'Collins, who used to work for the Liberal Party and was retrenched. He had a few words to say about the way in which Fightback was put together and some of the outcomes that might have been expected from it. He warned that unemployment would soar by at least 200,000 under a coalition government. Here is somebody who is intimately involved in the Fightback package claiming that another 200,000 people will be put out of work as a result of the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell railed against the unemployment rate. There is nobody on this side of the House who takes those figures lightly. There is nobody on this side of the House or, I am sure, on the other side who would be happy that the figure is as high as it is. But certainly we on this side of the House are doing something about it. Mr O'Collins said that he was not being bitter. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If my speaking out means Hewson gets beaten around the head a bit on Fightback for a month, then it will do him and Australia good.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition's plan to end tariff assistance would be particularly damaging and would result in about 200,000 people being sacked during the first term of a Hewson Government.</PARA>
<PARA>So that is the truth of it. Fightback is going to increase unemployment. We know that it is going to increase inflation and, with inflation going up, interest rates will go up. But that is the sort of panacea that is being held out by the Opposition as its prescription for what the country needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell also talked about the money from Qantas. He said that there was no long term benefit and that we were going to fiddle the books. All I can say about that is that, if we are going to fiddle the books, what was the Opposition going to do with the money? Was the Opposition going to fiddle the books also? I remind the honourable member for Mitchell that, if he is talking about paying back debt, there has only been one government in the nation's history that has ever done it, and that is this Government. We are paying past Liberal Party Government debt. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of tactic that the Opposition adopts. It was a grubby question. The Opposition sought to make some capital from the fact that the company in which the Prime Minister had invested did not have its returns in on time. Yet the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) left him for dead in those stakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it begs the question: what are members opposite on about?  Where is the substance and where are the policies? We hear speeches like that from the honourable member for Mitchell, who talked about the terrible fact that people in his electorate are losing jobs. The revolution that has occurred in the Australian economy over the last eight or nine years has meant that jobs will be lost. People who have been in jobs for a large number of years will see those jobs overhauled or replaced. But for every job that is lost, others are created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long, this country has gone along thinking that people could be employed at age 15 and knock off at 65 and still be in the same job in the same workplace. But those days are long gone. Back in the 1960s it may have been possible to think like that; but we have to change our attitudes, and they are changing under this Government. This is the only Government which has made significant changes in the economy&mdash;whether it is in the area of taxation, industry or tariff policy, or social welfare. All of those areas and more have been overhauled. Somebody revisiting Australia in 1992 would not recognise it, such has been the transformation in the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement takes that transformation even further. At a time of depressed economic activity, the Government has decided to inject sums of money into railways, roads, ports and all of those areas which will help our exports and our industries and which have been neglected for far too long. After the railway contracts have been let and completed, for the first time ever it will be possible to actually load something in Fremantle and take it all the way to Brisbane. How long has it taken Australia to get to that stage? I would say it has taken far too long. This initiative must do something to lower the cost of imports. Part of the Government's strategy is to make roads and ports more efficient. I think the efficiency on the waterfront would match that of any other area in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also contained in the One Nation statement is the additional allocation of $720m to TAFE. As a former TAFE teacher, I know that the money will be spent more efficiently in that education sector than in many others. It is that sector which will educate the people who will fill most of the positions that will be created in the Australian economy and most of the jobs that will be needed in the future. Not only will TAFE provide this education; links with industry will also be generated as a part of the overhaul of the TAFE system. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think it's less likely that it will hit 11 per cent, as Dr Hewson was saying several months ago?</PARA>
<PARA>He was asked that question in light of the latest unemployment figures which showed that the number of unemployed had actually plateaued. The honourable member for Bennelong replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't want to make any predictions about where it will hit. I mean, I haven't in the past done that because I want it to go down. I want Australians to get jobs. I want young Australians to have more hope. I want us to go back to a situation that used to exist when I left school, and that is, that if you wanted to get a job as a kid you could. And, we used to have a saying in Australia called the dead end job. That referred to somebody who got a job that didn't involve any kind of training, but you could get those in 50s and 60s&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you can't get them anymore. And, I would like to see Australia go back to those days&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, back to the days of the dead-end job when no training was required. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the jobs in Australia did not require training. Basically, in those days all we did was shear sheep, ship out wool, and dig up minerals and send them off. We never did anything smart with them. It was not until quite recently, when we started to see the advantage of adding value to our raw materials, that we started to think about training our people in Australia to add that value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the honourable member for Bennelong, in his nostalgic visit to the past&mdash;or his vision of the future; depending on one's point of view&mdash;said that he would like to go back to those days. We on this side of the House would not like to go back to those days because there is no future in having dead-end jobs. A country's prosperity can be measured, not by its physical resources, but by its human resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For far too long, Australia has been negligent in training its people. I remember that when I was working as an electrician there were hardly any apprentices around. We used to import all of our tradesmen from overseas. It was a lot cheaper for employers to get them from overseas than train them themselves. Nowadays, we know that all successful economies train their own people and that is what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the $720m which has been allocated to TAFE in the One Nation statement&mdash;which is in addition to the money that is already being spent on TAFE&mdash;will go a long way to giving our young people the skills they need in order to get better jobs. For each person who gets a better job in Australia&mdash;a job which pays more money&mdash;there will be a cumulative effect across Australia. If all of our young people get jobs, all of that extra earning will be reflected in the country's gross domestic product. It stands to reason that if there is a paddock full of people with no skills and a paddock full of people with skills, we will always do better with the second. </PARA>

It is a votergram from the Western Action Group of the western division of New South Wales which, as honourable members would know, is in drought at the moment. It is headed `Western Division S.O.S.'. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3 year drought&mdash;sheep dead&mdash;no production&mdash;no income&mdash;extreme pressure and foreclosures by banks.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Help! We're sinking fast!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contact us now!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need lifeboats!</PARA>
<PARA>Many members of the Parliament received this votergram and, as I represent most of the western division, I thought it was only proper that I bring this matter to the attention of the House. We all know that these people have been suffering over the last several years as a result of poor wool prices; the Hawke-Keating recession, now the Keating-Dawkins recession; and problems with the drought. There have been many pressures on them over the last several years. This has meant that the matter has been drawn to our attention on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I would like to speak about the rural counsellors who are trying to help the people in the western division. Where once upon a time there were only a few counsellors, there are now 19, and another seven are proposed for this year. Three years ago the rural assistance scheme was helping about 2,600 people; that number is now up to 7,000. Assistance by way of carry-on subsidies is provided through the rural assistance scheme for drought, for improving the farm, for maintaining the farm and, of course, for leaving the farm. As can be seen by this votergram, more and more people are leaving the farm because of this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Times at the moment are difficult and volatile. I would like to mention one particular rural counsellor, Fran Rowe, who has been in that position for six years. I do not know how Fran manages to carry on in this work, because it is difficult. Many of the people who see her are at their last ebb. They are affected in many ways. Their families have problems which have been brought about by the difficult situations they are facing. Overall, the number of farms in Australia in the last 25 years has dropped from 200,000 to 120,000. I believe that people leaving the land will increase by about 50 per cent this year alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people on the land at the moment are facing very difficult times, more particularly the people in the western division, whom I represent. I am bringing this matter to the attention of the House because in the past these people have been amongst the major wealth producers of this country. We have lived off the sheep's back and have lived on the toughness and resilience of these people in the west. I know a lot of the members here have been in the west, certainly the Minister for Family Support (Mr Simmons) and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), and they know just how tough the situation is. The farmers have been through drought, recession, low wool prices&mdash;just about every possible suffering they could go through&mdash;and every time they have put their head up it has been kicked. Eventually things start to fall apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Western Action Group and the people of the western division, I call on the House to try to do something to assist these people to stay on the land, because they are the wealth producers of this country, along with the mining fraternity and, to a small extent, the manufacturing sector. I call on the House to support the farmers where it can. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the remarks made by the honourable for Throsby (Mr Hollis). However, I came into the chamber to comment on another point&mdash;a point repeatedly made against the modelling contained in the Fightback package. That modelling is not meant to be more than illustrative, nor is it meant to cover the whole gamut of the Fightback package. Honourable members opposite repeatedly&mdash;yesterday, for instance, it was the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch)&mdash;make assertions against, all the benefits this side of the House claims, rightly, for the Fightback package, yet the modelling, in supplementary paper No. 1, embodies an increase in labour productivity to the year 2000, which is not much different from that which was actually achieved in the 1980s. Thus, when we adjust for the dependency effect and the participation and unemployment effects, the average increase in labour productivity for the 1980s is 0.7 per cent per annum, and for the Fightback modelling to the year 2000 it is 0.8 per cent per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I would stress in this connection is that the 0.7 per cent per annum for the 1980s is an average figure. After 1983, there was a lift in labour productivity associated with economic recovery and the bringing in to full use of new equipment. But from 1985, with the deadening effects on productivity of the accord, the increase in productivity flattens out. There was virtually no growth in labour productivity through to 1990-91, as set out in Industry Commission and other sources, including even the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this very day, at pages 36 and 37. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in the Fightback supplementary paper, then, there is presented the widely accepted Murphy model&mdash;the case where there are no major policy changes&mdash;for the period to 1995-96 and on to the year 2000, the average increase in labour productivity envisaged is only 0.43 per cent per annum, scenario A, or 0.4 per cent per annum, scenario B, reflecting the gradual but modest productivity growth from the latter 1980s doldrums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, however, you inject the micro-economic reforms, the tax reform and the labor relations reform&mdash;voluntary agreements for increased productivity&mdash;of the Fightback package, then, on the basis of Industry Commission, Business Council and other estimates, this is envisaged as raising the average productivity growth to the year 2000 to 0.8 per cent per annum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a big jump. It is true, then, that, on the face of it, this is only a small increase on the 1980s average, which was 0.7 per cent per annum, but it is a near doubling as compared with the situation in recent years and the accepted Murphy model projections in the absence of the major Fightback reforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's national accounts figures do not provide any grounds for questioning the relative shape and general thrust of these projections. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have acclaimed the 0.6 per cent increase in GDP for the March quarter as continuing the recovery, the so painfully slow recovery, of recent quarters from the most severe recession of the postwar years. That is welcome enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we look at table 3 of the accounts, that is, the contribution in percentage points of growth of the various components of GDP growth, we have increases in consumption, private and public, and in dwellings, totalling a full one percentage point of growth, more than outweighed by yet another&mdash;the eleventh in succession&mdash;decrease in private investment, a decrease in public investment and a decrease in net exports; a total of minus 1.1 percentage points of `growth'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there remains only the increase in stocks, private and public, of 0.7 percentage points to give you the recorded net growth&mdash;an item notoriously subject to considerable vagaries of estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the items on the negative side which are the cause for concern, fraught as they are with longer term significance for the recovery and sustainable growth of the economy. We have had this massive decrease over the last three years in investment and this sudden turnaround from the welcome recent increases in net exports. Private sector estimates so far as investment is concerned suggest that the national capital stock is actually decreasing. What is extraordinary is the conjunction of that with the massive increase in overseas indebtedness, when you include net equity liabilities, amounting to $200 billion. That is the net figure, including net equity liabilities. So the challenge facing the country is immense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went on to read the press release further and I thought, `Maybe he will have something interesting to inform me about what he perceives the Opposition is doing to assist the growth of this country. He went on and said, `The real answer, with all the solutions for everyone, is Fightback'. I would like to remind him, and particularly our members opposite, that in all of the OECD countries that have introduced a consumption tax, the rate has been subsequently increased&mdash;and increased substantially. The United Kingdom was going to be the great follower which the coalition wanted to copy. In the UK, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 17.5 per cent&mdash;a 75 per cent increase. In France, the standard rate has increased from 13.6 per cent to 18.6 per cent&mdash;a 37 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Austria, the standard rate has increased from 8 per cent to 20 per cent&mdash;a 150 per cent increase. In Denmark, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 22 per cent&mdash;a 120 per cent increase. In Germany, the standard rate has increased from 10 per cent to 14 per cent, and will increase further to 15 per cent in 1992. In Italy, the standard rate has increased from 12 per cent to 19 per cent&mdash;only a 58 per cent increase. And of course we have the great New Zealand model. In New Zealand, the rate has increased from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, without any compensation, in just three years&mdash;in other words, a 25 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look at what this Government has done to assist those people in need, the ones to whom this so-called Liberal candidate has referred. In particular, we have helped families. Over 200,000 families across Australia in the last 12 months have received a family allowance and family allowance supplement. To assist those families, the money goes directly to the carer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find, when we investigate, that 90 per cent of the family allowance supplement is used by those families to help pay for everyday essentials, relating particularly to the bringing up of their children. We know that 80 per cent of the family allowance supplement is spent by families on clothing for their children. We also know that over 50 per cent of that supplement payment to them by this Government is spent on food. Forty per cent of the family allowance supplement is spent on home expenses. In other words, the family allowance supplement is spent on the necessities of life, which would all be subject to tax under the GST, or so-called consumption tax. That consumption tax of 15 per cent will slash the capacity of these families to meet  their children's  needs.  It  will also increase the cost of clothing. It will increase the cost of food. It will increase rents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have the Opposition, and particularly the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), attempting to claim that the consumption tax would be very good for Australian families. It will be very good, all right. We will see Australia change. We will see people after nine months receiving no benefits. We will see universal superannuation completely opposed by the Opposition. We will see Medicare completely opposed by the Opposition. Capital gains tax will be opposed by the Opposition. Yet electorates such as mine are confronted with such ignorance in press releases by a candidate who has been brainwashed by the Liberal-National Party policies on what the Fightback package and the GST are all about. I say to him and I say to all members who have not fully studied and realised the ramifications of what a package such as this would do to their community to take time to sit down and read it, and then take time to go around the community and talk with the people it is going to affect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, the rich will get richer. They are the ones who will benefit from it. Obviously, the coalition and its members are the only ones they choose to represent them. But on this side of the House, we make a point of representing those who are least able to afford to pay and, most particularly, those who are least able to stand up for themselves, to defend their rights. I hope that we on this side of the House continue to fight and to make sure that those people can be served, that those people are getting the best and, most particularly, that those people never have to suffer a goods and services tax, as indicated by the Opposition in its Fightback package. It is no fight back; it is absolute disaster. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to bring to the attention of the House something that is really gratifying to talk about. It is good news that I am pleased to bring. The good news is the overwhelming response by the people of Canberra to a call by the Reverend Fred McMaster to donate good quality clothing to the children and people of the Ukraine, particularly in the Chernobyl area. Reverend McMaster, who was the superintendent of the Baptist churches in Canberra at the time, wrote a letter to all the churches appealing for as much clothing as they could possibly get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response was overwhelming, with over 3,000 kilograms of excellent clothing being donated by the people from the different churches. The logistics of getting three tonnes of clothing to the Ukraine was a pretty big problem. I was able to come into the story. I discovered that Aeroflot had two planes coming into Melbourne&mdash;one this week and one early next week&mdash;to pick up exchange crews for research and fishing vessels that have been brought into Melbourne. The General Manager of Aeroflot, Mr Victor Kasenov, has agreed to take the three tonnes of clothing back to the Soviet Union next Tuesday morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who coordinated the gathering of the clothing were Mr Peter and Mrs Valentina Gaschke, who were Ukrainians and are now Australian citizens. They came back with the cry that Australian people need to come to the aid of the people of the Ukraine in terms of clothing. So this has been a magnificent response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been overwhelming in its support. The embassy in Moscow is going to make sure that the transfer of goods in Moscow is satisfactory and that the 18 bales of clothing actually get to the people in Kiev who are waiting for it. Qantas, under the direction of the general manager of freight in Australia, Mr Emmet Hobbs, and the manager in Melbourne, Mr Richard Davies, has been absolutely overwhelming, to say the least, in its cooperative efforts to make sure that nothing goes wrong. We are able to get the 18 bales to Melbourne. All the paperwork, the Customs clearances and so on are being undertaken by Qantas. It is going to be a smooth operation to get the 18 bales of excellent clothing from Canberra, due to the generosity of the people here, to the Ukraine via Aeroflot, Qantas and the Russian embassy here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two people who raised the alarm for the Canberra people, Mr Peter and Mrs Valentina Gaschke, are going on the Russian airline with the bales. They have been allowed to travel on that airliner. The Russian embassy has been excellent. In particular, a chap by the name of Andrei, one of the Russian officials in the visa department, has been very helpful and very gentlemanly, and was extremely cooperative in seeing that Mr and Mrs Gaschke had their visas to go into Moscow and their visas to go from Moscow into the Ukraine stamped in their passports today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole exercise is one that we in this Parliament need to applaud and that the people of Australia need to applaud. The people of Australia need to repeat it so that we can help our fellow human beings who are suffering in a major way, particularly the children in Chernobyl as a result of the disaster that occurred there some years ago. I would like to place on the official record of this House my appreciation of what has been done. Indeed, I feel that I am echoing the appreciation of the whole House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want again tonight to raise the question of the impact of the goods and services tax upon the Australian community, Australian families and Australian business. I have asked in this place on several occasions: when is the Opposition going to come clean and explain why it is misleading the Australian public?  It says on page 116 of its document:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">we will continue to provide preferred tax treatment to the family home&mdash;in other words, we will not tax the family home . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But if one goes to the trouble of reading right through the document, one finds that on page 225 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of an average home&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is not a family home; it has now become an average home&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the net Goods and Services Tax impact is $2856 after discounting the effect of abolishing wholesale sales tax and petrol tax.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a blatant contradiction. It needs to be explained. Is it that an average home is never a family home, or is it that a family home is never an average home? There is a contradiction and a conflict in terms. The essential point lies in attempting to tell people that the cost of housing will not rise following the imposition of a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go on to refer to the impact on families, particularly lower income families, when they are forced to pay a 15 per cent GST on everything that they put in their mouth, on their feet and on their back. I have seen the brochure that has been handed around by the Opposition. I will come back to that in a moment. But there is another detail that I wanted to show specifically for the record so that honourable members on the other side of the House can come to understand just how specific and how personal the impact of goods and services tax would be on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it is going to reduce the family bill by the imposition of a goods and services tax. But bacon is not taxed, so it goes up 15 per cent; neither are bread, breakfast cereals, cheese, coffee, eggs, flour, fruit and vegetables, margarine, meat, milk, peanut butter, frozen peas, tinned pineapple, rice, spaghetti, sugar, tea, tomato sauce and tuna. But do people not eat those products?  The Opposition is saying that the costs will be reduced by the abolition of the wholesale sales tax. It is a wonderful statement, but a dishonest statement. The brochure says that abolishing the wholesale sales tax will save Australians $9.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the information of the House, I have run through some of the items which will be going up in cost by at least 15 per cent. In actual practice, they will go up by more than that because, as distributors and small business people pay GST, as they outlay money, they will mark their margin up on the increased cost. They are not that generous. They do not go on the basis of what they have on credit. If they have paid out cash, the standard practice in their experience is to put their 20 per cent or 33 1/3 per cent margin on top of that. So the actual increase is more than the straight 15 per cent. In item one of the Opposition's brochure it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wholesale sales tax abolished! Saves Australians $9.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>It substitutes a collection of $27 billion through GST for $9.4 billion. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You might not realise it but right now you are paying up to 30% on many goods you buy.</PARA>
<PARA>The 30 per cent tax rate produces 6.8 per cent of total sales tax income. In other words, 93.2 per cent of sales tax does not come from the 30 per cent tax rate. I would love to have the Opposition's calculations to see how one can take 6.8 per cent of gross sales tax income and use that to make people better off in respect of all those goods and services that are to be taxed at 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter is the 15 per cent imposition upon tourism. Tourism is that industry for which we have a wonderful potential. It is growing. Historic aviation policy changes in the last two days will assist it. But what the Opposition wants to do is impose a 15 per cent differential, which will immediately increase the price of all the tourist services in this country and put us at a substantial disadvantage in comparison with the countries and regions of world with which we compare. The best example is to look to 1990, when the Swedish Government extended the VAT to include tourism. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am certainly not going to do the reading for him. He should also look at the increase allowed to first home buyers.
