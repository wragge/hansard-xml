<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise in support of the Government's Appropriation Bill as it relates to defence and to acknowledge, at the outset, the success of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in ensuring that in 1992-93 defence expenditure has been maintained in real terms yet again. In achieving that result the Minister has been able to follow on the good work undertaken by his predecessor. In 1992-93 the allocation for defence has been increased by $523m, resulting in zero real growth, maintaining expenditure in real terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that some 88 per cent of the total defence expenditure in this Budget is expended in Australia, thereby substantially assisting Australian enterprise and, of course, helping employment. As has been mentioned throughout the debate, a number of projects have been brought forward from the Forward Estimates into this financial year and this will play a significant part in generating employment and assisting the economic recovery which is now under way. It should be stated that those items which have been brought forward will result in a slight reduction in expenditure in the Forward Estimates of 0.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget continues a program of major restructure and capital acquisition in Australia's defence forces. There are a number of big ticket items that the Government has committed to as part of the re-equipment and development of our defence network. A few of those deserve special mention. The ongoing construction of our Collins class submarines will cost some $720m in this financial year. I would like to mention the excellent work that has been done by the Australian Submarine Corporation in the construction of those Collins class submarines. The first of those submarines has had major sections completed in Sweden by Kockums, a world renowned firm in shipbuilding and a leader in the field globally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dobell quite correctly points out, compared with the early decisions taken by conservative governments, when some vessels were fully imported and in some cases second-hand, this Government's decision to equip ourselves with state of the art Australian built submarines is to be commended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the quality of the workmanship undertaken by the Submarine Corporation in South Australia surpasses that of Kockums own work in Sweden. Indeed, in those sections of the submarine which have been completed in Sweden and subjected to strenuous quality tests, which include x-ray of the material and all joins, it has been found that there were more faults in the workmanship of the sections completed in Sweden than there were in those completed in Australia. The improvement in quality here is marked. There are something like one-third fewer faults in the sections that are completed in Australia. That is a great credit to the Australian men and women who are involved in building those submarines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Anzac frigate program, which is undertaken jointly with New Zealand, is a major program to see our naval defence going into the next century. This year we have allocated some $443m for that project. There is an allocation of some $121m for the FA18 tactical fighter project. There is an allocation of $193m for the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network. As I mentioned last year, I am very pleased to see the continuation of funding to the over-the-horizon network. I think it is an exciting venture, one which is genuinely involved in the defence of our region and one in which Australia, along with only two other countries, leads technology. It is a great credit to the Australian men and women involved in those projects that we are able to undertake such highly skilled activities and do them so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of some regret to me that recently a contract for communications equipment was let to an overseas company as I know there was a major tender from an Australian consortium headed by Telecom. I would urge the Minister to ensure that on future occasions Australian suppliers, Australian tenderers, are given every opportunity to bid successfully for defence contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some irony in this particular contract because one of the major partners in the consortium, along with Telecom, was a Brisbane firm which recently tendered for some communications equipment for NATO, only to be told by NATO not that its standard was not good enough but that it did not have sufficient European content. Having been ruled out of a NATO contract because it was Australian, it seems not to have been given any advantage here because it is Australian. I think that is a matter of great regret and I urge the Government to look at these questions when large capital acquisitions and supplies are put to tender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ready Reserve is now a year old. I am pleased to say that the Ready Reserve, which is now quartered at Enoggera Army barracks in my electorate, consists of an exceedingly fine body of men and women. I have had an opportunity to visit them and to talk to them formally and informally. I am impressed by their dedication, their commitment and their quality. The Ready Reserve does Australia proud and it is an initiative which I think will prove to be cost effective. It will provide us with full strength battalions. It will provide us a 6th Brigade at full strength. The quality of the people that we have been able to recruit into that program is outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 6th Brigade continues to benefit and enjoy a high quality of leadership. Brigadier Peter Cosgrove, the current commander, is an outstanding military officer and leader and has continued what I thought was a thoroughly professional and outstanding job undertaken by his predecessor, Brigadier Rod Earle. I would also like to mention the way in which Headquarters 1st Division has continued to adopt its new role as part of the changes that have been implemented over the past year or so. I congratulate General Arnison for his service to 1st Division and to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said last year that it is a matter of some regret to me that in the process of implementing the Ready Reserve, a concept which I support, we have found it necessary to reduce the number of regular battalions and the integrated battalion that was previously at Enoggera. It is my hope that finances in the years ahead will enable the Commonwealth to re-establish an additional regular battalion to augment those already in place and to look at the experience of the integrated battalion which was at Enoggera last year and which I think did the Army great credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Saturday I will be very pleased to stand on the City Hall dais and honour the 8/9 Battalion, which will be given freedom of the City of Brisbane. That is a rare honour afforded to only a few. The 8/9 Battalion will receive that honour this Saturday and I will be pleased to be part of that ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the new scheme announced in the Budget which provides for some private investment in Defence Housing Authority assets. I encourage the Minister to ensure that defence personnel are given priority in having the opportunity to invest in their own homes, or at least in those homes which they occupy from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not allow us to go into the full details here, but I think it is important in this debate to record finally that in contrast with the Government's commitment to maintaining expenditure in real terms this year, the Liberal Party Fightback package provides for cuts of $500m, with net cuts of $200m, in a full year. That would involve the elimination of in excess of 2,000 personnel from the defence forces. It cannot be covered up by rhetoric, as the Opposition has sought to do from time to time in this debate. Those opposite who have criticisms of perceived shortcomings need to reconcile them with their stated commitment to a $500m&mdash;$200m net&mdash;cut in expenditure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is normally a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and this morning I agree with most of what he said in relation to defence expenditure, with a couple of marked exceptions. First of all, I have to disagree with his assessment of the aspects of the Opposition's Fightback policy in the defence area. Basically, all Australians should welcome what we will be doing: we will put the strength at the sharp end rather than perpetuate a lot of the bureaucracy which exists in the Department of Defence and elsewhere at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I do not agree with him in terms of the Ready Reserve. The shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has already made some comments about that and we will be saying a lot more about it in the context of our defence policy when it is released shortly. I say to the honourable member for Brisbane that the Ready Reserve is only a reaction to budgetary pressures and has the potential to perpetuate inefficiencies within the Reserve and, in fact, generate a first and second XI within the Reserve elements of our Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with him in terms of quality control in our programs and I will add to his comments on this issue. The Perry class FFGs which are being built at Williamstown are also being credited with a much higher level of quality control than the American-built ones. I heard that comment in Taiwan recently at China Ship Building where they are also building Perry class vessels. They acknowledged that Australia is doing very well indeed on that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to last night's debate, I say at the outset that I was a little disappointed by the unwarranted and somewhat uncharacteristic reactions and criticisms which the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) directed at the honourable member for Mayo in terms of the Opposition defence policy. Clearly, the honourable member for Herbert knows a lot more about the Opposition's defence policy than do a lot in the Opposition at the moment. All I would say to him is: watch this space. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mayo is saying&mdash;and I agree with him entirely&mdash;that the Government is flying in the face of its own Defence White Paper. The Government defence policy has been based on the assumption of real growth in defence spending in the 1990s. I simply refer the chamber to the force structure review of 18 months ago when it was claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should financial allocations fall below no real growth over the decade, few of the priority capital equipment programs could be funded. Such a reduced program would preclude the maintenance of a strategy of defence in depth as outlined in "The Defence of Australia 1987".</PARA>
<PARA>These cuts will be reflected in the 1993-94 Budget, as the honourable member for Mayo said last evening. So by its own admission and according to its own assumptions in this Budget the Government cannot fulfil the Defence White Paper objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago when the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) released the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Strategic Planning in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the so-called ASP `90 document&mdash;he said that nothing had fundamentally changed in regional security since 1987 and there was no reason to change the fundamental defence approach set out in that White Paper. Yet in Budget Paper 9.4 on page 278 we see the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development and application of strategic guidance through the preparation of a new strategic review based on an assessment of the changes occurring in the region and more broadly, and their effect upon Australia's strategic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is saying that it is looking for another review and is really putting a question mark over the White Paper DOA `87. It really comes down to the fact that the Government has clearly lost its initiative in terms of the defence debate and is seeking, in one way or another, simply to catch up to what the Opposition has been doing&mdash;bearing in mind that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) established a wide-ranging review in January last year and the results of that will be announced at a time which is suitable to this side, not to anybody sitting on the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has done nothing in terms of ASP `90 except release a 1989 study which simply endorses the conclusions of that 1987 document. It has done this at precisely the same time as the Department is producing a new strategic assessment. So how can the Ministers say that they sit very happily with the strategic assessment as it is at the moment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time left to me, I would also like to refer to something else which the honourable member for Mayo said last evening in relation to the somewhat emotive subject of homosexuality in the Australian Defence Force. I agree with him that it is a small issue in the larger defence plot, but I think the whole issue highlights a number of factors. Firstly, I think it highlights&mdash;and we have seen some media discussion of this in recent weeks&mdash;basically who makes the decisions in terms of defence policy. Is it the Minister or Ministers or is it a Caucus minority? Secondly, what is the authority of the senior Minister, Senator Ray. We have read a lot about the ongoing debate between Senator Ray and his junior Minister, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and also the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), with their legalistic approaches to the whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and very important point concerns the role of the advice of the Chiefs of Staff in this whole issue. My views concerning homosexuality in the Defence Force are very well known, publicly and privately. I think the existing policy is there for good and valid reasons, whether they be reasons of national and personal security; health; moral standards; very importantly, in locus parentis responsibility for minors; teamwork; orderly discipline in a military environment; and, not the least, operational effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the big difference between this side of the chamber and the Government is in relation to the professional advice of the Chiefs of Staff. When we are in Government we will accept that advice which, at the moment, is to maintain the status quo. All I can say to Senator Ray is, `Hang in there. You are right and some of the minority influences in your Caucus are wrong'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think he will be rolled and that will be shown very clearly. Today I would also like to pay tribute to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Committee, and Peter Poulten in particular, for what they did in Canberra last weekend. For too long they have been the forgotten group in the defence community. I hope that last weekend put it into national perspective and that in fact at long last the bravery and the sacrifice of many of those who went to Vietnam&mdash;and regrettably some who did not return&mdash;has been recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally I would like to pay tribute to the continuing professionalism of the Australian Defence Force. That is reflected in a recent book which I have just been given, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Gulf Commitment&mdash;</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Defence Force's First War</EMPHASIS>, which is written by David Horner from the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the ANU. With the indulgence of the Committee I will read a couple of very brief passages from that. Firstly, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation largely confirmed that the new arrangements in HQADF and the higher command structure in the ADF could respond to the demands of the government and were effective in planning and controlling an operational commitment. No doubt minor refinements will be necessary, but on the Gulf experience there is no need for wholesale changes.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of the HQADF staff was epitomised by officers such as Gration, Beaumont, Taylor,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who happens to be my brother, and I am very proud of that comment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sanderson, Grey and Baker. All were highly experienced, forward thinking, sensitive to political requirements, and determined not to interfere in the conduct of operations.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he finished his book by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But in a sense the Gulf War marked a coming of age of the ADF. . . Only the churlish or the macabre would complain that in its first war&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, let me acknowledge the contributions of the two previous speakers, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). Whilst I do not agree with everything the honourable member for Groom says, I think he brings to this debate a great deal of experience and knowledge in the area of defence, given his career in the Navy. However, I am sure he will understand that that will not assuage my concern about the Opposition defence policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to detail my concerns about that issue other than to reinforce what the honourable member for Brisbane said&mdash;that there is a chasm between the policies of the Opposition and those of the Government in this area. Ample evidence of that is obviously the proposal to cut $500m. Whilst those opposite might think that that will not have a dramatic impact on the way in which the Defence Force operates, I think it will. If they think there is $500m worth of fat in the Department of Defence, they are sadly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government's contribution&mdash;indeed the role of successive Ministers and now that of Senator Ray&mdash;in advancing the cause of the Defence Force through this Parliament and through the Government is seen with a great deal of respect by members of the Defence Force. I believe they understand that even in the difficult economic times that we have experienced over the last couple of years there has been a sustained level of expenditure in the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns the Opposition has expressed about defence policy are misplaced. The way in which the Government has pursued priorities in the defence area very clearly suggests that it really has a focus. As a person who lives in the Northern Territory, where we are very much part of that focus, it is a great privilege for me to be able to say to this chamber that the contributions made by the defence forces and the expenditures which have been put in place by this Government are seen as very important, not only to the Australian community but to the Northern Territory community in particular. I will come to that in more detail in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that one of the principles upon which the force structure review, to which the honourable member for Groom referred, was based was meeting the strategic focus on northern and western operations by extending western basing for the Navy and northern basing for further major Army units and enhancing the forward deployment capacity of the Air Force. That has been progressively undertaken over a number of years, and it is worth understanding that the initial premise for this force structure review and, indeed, the policy and the movement towards the north were founded on the Dibb report and the White Paper to which the honourable member referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Air Force base in Katherine operated for many years after the Second World War and was closed down by a conservative government. Opposition members should check their history. In any event this Government has resourced the Defence Force in a way to enhance the presence of the defence forces in northern Australia in accordance with the Dibb report, the White Paper which arose from it and the Defence Force structure review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that the 2nd Cavalry Regiment will move to Darwin next year; in fact it is in the process of moving now. It will be progressively followed across the decade by an armoured regiment less its reserve tank squadron, logistical elements, an Army aviation squadron, an infantry battalion, a combat engineer regiment, an artillery battery and a signal squadron. By the turn of the century both of the Army's regular brigades will be based in northern Australia, at Darwin and at Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that in itself is demonstration enough of the Government's commitment to the White Paper's recommendations and the force structure review's report. To the Northern Territory, of course, it is of particular relevance. Indeed, since I have been in the Northern Territory, one thing that has struck me is the very positive way in which the defence forces have been received by the Northern Territory community, not only because of the economic impact they have on the community generally but because of the very positive role that the Defence Force personnel have as members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I acknowledge Air Commodore Peter Nicholson, who is now Commander Northern Command. As the honourable member for Groom would know, Commodore Nicholson was commanding officer at Tindal before moving down here and being appointed back to the Northern Territory. He is someone with experience in northern Australia, and he is well regarded in our community. Captain Ian Watts, Naval Officer Commanding North Australia, is likewise very well respected within the community, as are all the commanders: Colonel Doug Gibbons, Assistant Commander (Land), Northern Command; Group Captain Macaulay Cottrell, Commander RAAF North Australia; Group Captain Bruce Mouatt, who is now Officer Commanding at Tindal; Commander David Horton, Commanding Officer HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coonawarra</EMPHASIS>; and Lieutenant Colonel Denis Burke, who is commanding officer of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment based in Darwin. All of these people lead significant numbers of personnel, all of whom have a very positive role and are very well received in Darwin and in the Northern Territory community generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant impact of the Defence Force in northern Australia is on the economy. I think it is worth recalling for a moment how important that is. Discounting the capital works programs in the Defence Force, the Defence Force salaries and administration expenditure in the Northern Territory last financial year was in the vicinity of $90m. All up, with programs and facilities, its expenditure was in excess of $168m. Such expenditure has a significant impact on the Northern Territory economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth recalling the impact on the housing industry, particularly in Darwin. The Defence Force Housing Authority expended $27.5m in 1991-92 and, with the approval of the Public Works Committee of this Parliament&mdash;with which the honourable member for Groom, who is a member, recently visited the Northern Territory&mdash;will expend $48m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major proportion of this work goes to local contractors who will receive the lion's share. That has an enormous impact on the housing and construction industry and on employment in northern Australia. It underlines what we have been saying for some time&mdash;that Defence Force expenditure and public sector expenditure emanating from the Commonwealth underpins the Northern Territory economy. I think it is worth looking at the size of the Northern Territory's budget; it is around $1.6 billion. A recent report prepared for the Government by the James Cook University recommending a north Australian economic strategy is, in my view, very deficient. It does not really examine the impact of public sector expenditures and their role in the economy in the way it ought. It does not adequately discuss the multipliers which emanate from public sector expenditure in the Northern Territory economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said already that the impact of the Defence Force expenditure was around $168m last financial year. That is one Government department. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission&mdash;ATSIC&mdash;will itself, in addition to the $168m which is being spent by Defence, spend $120m. That does not go through the Northern Territory Government's books, and neither does the Defence Force expenditure, but they both have a tremendous impact on the total Northern Territory economy and regional economies within the Northern Territory. There is not one community in the Northern Territory which is not impacted upon quite heavily by ATSIC expenditure, yet it is not something which has been really picked up by these people who have analysed the role of the Northern Territory economy or the role of the Commonwealth payments. I might point out that it is not the only area, but I think the Defence expenditure outlines its importance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

There are several  elements and in 10 minutes there is little chance of covering the whole gamut. The first thing that worries me is that I have little doubt that, while there has been progress in some aspects of defence, the present stratagems followed by the Government do not, to my mind, realistically relate to the defence threat nor to the requirements for defence commitment as far as the Australian Defence Force is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we understand that the 1987 White Paper has been underfunded and is unlikely ever to be fulfilled in its objectives. We should understand that it was a rewrite of Dibb, and Dibb was a paper that was an abject failure. It attempted to try to rewrite a threat scenario by suggesting low level threats on Australian security, which most of us accept are not the area where it is most likely that Australian defence forces will be committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the force structure review and the extent to which it has developed in the Ready Reserve a group of Australians who, well motivated and well trained as they will be, regrettably will be unable to maintain their return commitment because of the extent to which it stretches into a time of their lives when they will either be in full time university training or in a full time occupation and will find it difficult to take leave to meet those obligations. This reduces the extent to which there is a capacity to meet whatever service obligations there might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can illustrate it briefly by the fact that those excellent Australians now serving in Cambodia and in other peacekeeping forces around the world are unlikely to be able to be in any way resupplied from the Ready Reserve, and certainly not from those who are coming back on return of service obligations. The nature and character of the demands of their civilian obligations mean they will be spread around Australia. I see no point or purpose in preserving the farce of the Ready Reserve for I do not believe it will in any way meet the defence requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the individual elements of the Budget are concerned, there are several aspects to which I want to refer. I am most concerned that in both the Navy and in the Air Force the running cost item, identified within the Defence estimates, is a reduction in 1992-93 on the 1991-92 actual expenditure. To my mind, one of the lessons of the last few years has been the extent to which, tragically, we have had a number of accidents. They have involved a 707, F111s and F118s, all of which have been largely to my mind as a result of inadequate flying hours. There is a problem in trying to provide enough resource to maintain pilots at a degree of expertise and proficiency that allows them to maintain the very high standards of skill required to fly those aircraft and, as far as the Navy is concerned, to keep its ships in a state of operational serviceability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Navy, we have been fortunate in that, while we have had on recurrent deployment a number of vessels in the Gulf, those vessels have been able to run up to a high peak of operational efficiency. They have operated in an integrated manner with ships, particularly of the United States Navy, but with other allied detachments. It means that successively there have been small elements of the Navy which have achieved the standards of efficiency required. We need to remember that the number of vessels available to send to participate in operation Desert Storm was only limited by the amount of equipment available. It was only by re-positioning equipment from other vessels that the ships that were allocated to the Gulf service were able to so perform. We have got problems, as I see it, in the availability of equipment and certainly in the training opportunities available for members particularly of the Navy and the Air Force in the inadequate allocation of running costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the composition of the Budget that we on this side of the chamber are particularly critical of the Government. The Government has done a few fiddles. There is a great deal made in Budget Paper No. 1 about the extent to which the Defence Housing Authority is taking off budget a number of present expenditures. I think that is most commendable, but I think it also needs to be realised that that does not help to maintain a greater sharp end performance. We need to realise that although the Defence Housing Authority has achieved a great deal, again it is not new. The program was initiated 10 years ago and needs to be maintained. It is certainly one that I would hope we can develop in parallel with what is happening in the United States where they are actually allowing individual servicemen and women to participate in owning their own home, moving on, and retaining shares in a house, which gives them the same chance for capital appreciation as has every other Australian. I know Bill Kirkby-Jones, who is in charge of the Defence Housing Authority, has such a scheme in mind. I trust it eventuates because I think that has been one of the critical areas of incomparability as far as service in Defence is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other areas I wanted to mention, including defence science. I am most concerned that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation seems now to be somewhat of a forgotten child within the Defence Department. As far as I am concerned the work it has undertaken has been exemplary. While I am all in favour of allowing it to participate in the private sector to a greater degree, any reduction in the funds provided to it is likely to impact significantly on our own self-sufficiency. Our problems are in getting enough money to proceed to develop the techniques and the equipment developed within DSTO, but it is certainly essential that we in no way reduce the capability of that outstanding organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several other aspects that I want to mention. The first is homosexuality in the defence forces. I know that there has been some discussion of that topic in this debate. I note that the Aulich committee report is recommending there be given  some particular recognition to homosexuals in the defence forces. I understand the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), amongst others of the Government, is in favour of this course. One thing I suggest to those concerned is that it is important that they recognise that anything that will prejudice the maintenance of good order and discipline in the services will reduce service capability. By seeking to do what they assert, they will put homosexuals in a different category from everybody else in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there are no doubt many within the Services who have homosexual propensities. People are not discriminated against on that basis; they are discriminated against because of the way in which they undertake those propensities. We need to understand that what is now asserted would put into a required preferred position practices which may well prejudice the good conduct and discipline of the forces. This is what the Government and some of its members may seek to do. I say `some of its members', for the position taken by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, is one which I would totally endorse&mdash;that the responsibility in this matter should rest where it does with every other matter of personal or other behaviour in the Services. It is a matter for the chiefs of the services to determine on the basis of the responsibility which is theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who preceded me in this debate, I would like to commend the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Committee, and in particular Peter Poulten, on the outstanding success of the celebrations last weekend. The Vietnam veterans rendered a tremendous contribution to this country. It is tragic that so many of them were not recognised on their return. I think it is magnificent that at long last they are being treated equally with all others who have served this country in sad campaigns. I say `sad' because tragically on each occasion some of those who have left Australia's shores have not returned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 October it will be the seventy-fifth anniversary of the charge of Beersheba. The charge of Beersheba was the last occasion when the Australian Light Horse engaged in a truly cavalry activity. The charge itself is one which has gone down in history. But the significance of it is that the inspiration of those commitments by Light Horse detachments and regiments remains behind the existence of so many of the Reserve detachments, certainly the 12/16 Hunter River Lancers in northern New South Wales. They are having a big celebration on that day. Some of the sons and descendants of those who participated in the charge of Beersheba are still members of the unit. But to my mind as important as recognising the contribution of Vietnam veterans is understanding that the prime conditions of the regiments of Australia should be preserved for the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Fightback we announced that in government we will redirect $300m to enhancing Defence Force combat capability out of savings to be made in the administration and non-strategic support areas of defence and also through commercialisation and contracting-out reforms. I was interested to note the increase in outlays of $39.6m for defence equipment and stores, but I am also concerned that the Army Survey Regiment, which is based at the Fortuna building in Bendigo, has yet to be equipped with a large format printing press. This particular press would enable the regiment to print what it likes when it likes and would enhance its capability to supply accurate and up-to-date maps to the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently had the pleasure of inviting the shadow Minister for defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), to come to my electorate and to visit the Army Survey Regiment at Bendigo. I am sure that the honourable member for Mayo was impressed with the capability, the technical expertise and efficiency, and the productivity of the Survey Regiment at Bendigo. I understand that the Survey Regiment has capabilities which are renowned worldwide. In fact, it does quite an amount of work with overseas agencies, including those in the US and the United Kingdom, particularly in the application of some of its technical expertise relating to computer programs and its topographical mapping section. The added impact of having a large format printing press would give it much greater flexibility and improved efficiency in its operations. </PARA>

The ADI is a major employer in the Bendigo electorate and has an excellent reputation for producing high quality engineering products. Recently in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current work at ADI Bendigo's Finn St facility includes the manufacture of 105 mm guns for the Australian Defence Force and high precision engine components for the US General Electric Company.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very diversified company now. It is also involved in the frigate work and the submarine contract. As people in the defence forces would recognise, the major capital expenditures in 1992-93 will include $720m for the Collins class submarines, $443m for the Anzac ships, and also $79m for the Australian frigate, all of which the Bendigo ADI has had a close association with and has performed some work for. In fact, during the past two weeks ADI Bendigo has handed over torpedo tubes for the Collins class submarine project and the tubes will be the main armament for those vessels. One can understand that with that level of skill there is a need for the Government to make a commitment, and I hope that it does make a commitment, to staffing levels at Australian Defence Industries Bendigo and that very little of that redundancy money which is mentioned will be spent in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice another alarming trend. I view with some concern a continuing decline in the numbers of the regular forces, as it seems to indicate a lack of commitment by the Government to defending our nation. Really, it is in line with the Government's intentions to reduce the number of Regular Army battalions from six to two. That causes concern. I think it is absolutely fundamental to Australia that we ensure that we have sound defences in this country. I am pleased, however, to see an increase in the number of training days for the Army Reserve, and that should particularly benefit the 15 Transport Squadron, which is based in Bendigo and which comprises many army reservists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I had the pleasure approximately 12 months ago of joining the 15 Transport Squadron in an exercise in driving techniques at the driving training course, and I found that there was a great deal of commitment from the people who were involved with the squadron. They are dedicated people who give of their time very freely and who are particularly dedicated to reaching a high standard of training and commitment to the Army Reserve. They take the effort to increase their skills to a high level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that other Reserve units, including the 15 Transport Squadron, are consistently hampered by the lack of money for training days. I ask that the Government have a look at the amount of money that is being provided to Reserve units and see whether it can in fact direct additional money to provide for those additional training days so that the people who participate in them can keep up a high level of skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members and members of the forces would be particularly aware, training is an essential part of enhancing the Defence Force's combat capability. Over recent years, of course, Federal Government policies have significantly reduced Air Force flying hours, Navy days at sea and also Army training days. For example, according to figures provided by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in a response to a parliamentary question on notice earlier this year, total flying time for an F111 aircraft decreased by over 500 hours in 1990-91 compared with 1987-88 and FA18 flying hours fell by over 200 hours in 1990-91 compared with 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former members of the RAAF, particularly pilots, have expressed concern that RAAF fighter pilots now average approximately 170 flying hours each year, compared with 240 flying hours several years ago. This is an alarming trend, and it is one that I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table, will take note of. He is nodding in agreement. I hope he will pass on to the Minister for Defence my comments regarding training and the essential need for enhancing the skills of the Defence Force and improving its combat capability. It is important that the Government recognise that. Certainly, a coalition government would recognise that and would reverse that trend by giving priority to increased combat capability and reducing the bloated non-combat defence bureaucracy. It is important to give a clear indication to members of the Defence Force that a coalition government will spend money to enhance the opportunity for members of the Defence Force to get practical experience from training and to improve their combat capability. </PARA>

As the Deputy Chairman, who is associated with my electorate, would probably know, I have considerable involvement with the Richmond RAAF base, which many describe as Australia's premier Air Force base. It is certainly the largest transport base in Australia, although the Government seems to be doing everything it can to whittle it down in size. I have no idea why, and I will talk a little about that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from all that, I always feel that debates on defence ought to be bipartisan in every respect. It is a critical area and one in which we ought to come together more than we do. Certainly in wartime we have war cabinets which are a combination of both Opposition and Government members. Nevertheless there are areas of disappointment and it is right that they be expressed, as has been the case in this debate last night and today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember speaking at some length on the Dibb report when it came out some years ago. In later years I had to express regret, as I do again now, at the fact that not a great deal resulted from a Government policy and activity point of view with respect to that report. It was the same with some of the White Papers. There is more activity following from the Wrigley report, but even then I think it is a bit disappointing that there is a lot of concern and worry amongst RAAF personnel and Defence Force personnel in general over the cutbacks that are taking place over time in the Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that Defence Force personnel are being unkind, unthinking or lacking in compassion but, when one talks to defence personnel who are affected by the offers of remustering and so on, there is a great deal of disappointment. These are not just isolated cases. They are cases involving quite large delegations, often of wives of servicemen, who are deeply concerned about their future and that of their spouse and family. Many of them have started to make a full time career of the RAAF and the cutbacks and the remusterings are causing them a lot of heartache and concern, even though there may be arguments put forward that the RAAF, or the defence forces generally, are trying to make the remusterings as painless as possible. Nevertheless, there still is a lot of pain associated with many of the remustering offers that are taking place as a result of the rationalisation, as it is called, of the RAAF and the defence forces in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The civilianisation of the defence forces is an issue in itself. One has to ask whether we are really heading in the right direction in every respect. Some of the changes are quite right and proper, but the very fact that there are lots of questions being asked by the personnel in the forces themselves causes me to be fairly concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the RAAF base at Richmond has fitted into the community extremely well. The current commanding officers and officer commandings are to be complimented for the fact that they have carried on an excellent tradition of PR in the district, that they have participated in community activities and, probably more importantly, that they have engaged willingly and generously in community work on so many occasions, not just in the local area when there have been floods and fires but throughout the nation generally. The larger transport aircraft, such as the Hercules and the Caribou, have been used extensively to assist in Nyngan&mdash;and we still remember the floods well&mdash;Charleville in Queensland and in many other areas. They have been prepared and willing to spend many hours assisting those people in this country who have faced great difficulty due to natural disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recall the excellent work put in by the Hercules crews when the pilot strike was on. These men put in countless hours&mdash;and bear in mind that they do not get overtime; they get only time in lieu. This again causes me to wonder how on earth we can civilianise so many areas of the Defence Force with all the associated conditions that go with civilian occupations and employment and how it can be cost effective to get rid of the dedicated members of the Defence Force and rationalise the Services in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air Commodore Stan Clarke, who is the most senior officer at the base, is doing an excellent job, as is Group Captain Paul Rassmussan and Group Captain Stewart McAllister, who is in charge of the 707 fleet. A number of other squadrons, including the VIP squadron, are headquartered out of Richmond. All the men are an absolute credit to the Air Force, of which they are so very proud. From time to time we receive a rare complaint about noise coming out of the base. The people who are concerned about noise are visited by the most senior officers on the base. They go out and take the trouble to sit down and talk with these people. There are curfews in place from 11 o'clock at night until 6 o'clock in the morning. This curfew is adhered to almost 100 per cent. On only rare occasions, for various strategic reasons and emergencies, is the curfew broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have a regret about the base. One of the questions I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Price) to put to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is: why on earth it is necessary to shift, at great expense&mdash;tens of millions of dollars&mdash;the 707 Squadron from Richmond to Brisbane? It is very difficult to come up with any rational reason why that transfer should be undertaken, at great expense, other than that it may be for political reasons. I sincerely hope that that is not the case, but everybody seems to tell me that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having the 707s based at Richmond, the simulator at Qantas that must be used is only an hour's drive away. The repairs and heavy maintenance that have to be done on the 707s will still have to be done at Richmond. The refits and so on are done at the Qantas base. It is very difficult to find real and substantial reasons to justify spending tens of millions of dollars on transferring the 707s. They are high-speed aircraft and it takes them only a very short time to get to Brisbane. The relocation from Richmond to Brisbane does not seem to be a very commonsense one to me, nor to many other people, as I found when I started to inquire about it. I ask the Minister to give an indication as to why that may be the case. </PARA>

The CSIRO is in there helping them, and they are really impressing the local residents, including those who are very particular about what happens to these areas from an environmental point of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Christmas, and we have missed a couple of Christmases already. In his contribution, the shadow Minister made much of the Government's commitment in forthcoming budgets to reduce defence expenditure by some $50m. He has portrayed this as some sort of shocking, irresponsible example of government policy. In his own contribution he failed to say that in Fightback the Opposition proposes to cut expenditure&mdash;not by $50m per year over three years, but by $200m in one year. I suppose it is fair enough for oppositions to say that they propose to cut expenditure, but I think the decent thing oppositions should do is to outline exactly where they will cut it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that it will cut expenditure in the general administrative area. If there is a consistent theme that the Opposition shadow spokesman has adopted, it is to denigrate those civilians who are employed in the Defence Department as though they undertake some sub-optimal role in the defence effort. From my own dealings in the acquisition and logistics area, I can only talk highly of the defence personnel who work there. Although it is true that they are not in the sharp end of the business, they significantly contribute to the capacity of the ADF to perform and operate at maximum efficiency. I think that it is regrettable to deprecate their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where will the Opposition save this $200m in general administration? Is it in furniture? Is it in paper? How will the Opposition save it? It does not outline it at all, yet it portrays a $50m cut by the Government over three years as being irresponsible and its cut of $200m in one year as being responsible. I think that the people of Australia should rightly dismiss the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly interested to see where the Opposition's policy is in relation to the major capital equipment program, because this Government has a very proud record. In the last year that the Opposition was in government, it spent something like $476m on major capital equipment. That tells us that it was prepared to take the easy decisions in defence. It was prepared to keep up the numbers of ADF personnel but to keep them poorly equipped in terms of their operational efficiency. We have turned that around dramatically and maintained it in a recessionary Budget, which has been most difficult, at the level not of $476m&mdash;not even keeping that in constant dollars&mdash;but of something like $2.3 billion for major capital equipment. We are seeing the results of that in further contributions of money in this Budget towards the submarine project, the frigates and a whole variety of other important and essential equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing this Government contributed was that it changed the equation of Australian industry involvement. The Opposition had a shocking record with its view that overseas and off the shelf was best. So it was no surprise that in this program only some 30 per cent of available money for defence was actually spent in Australia and 70 per cent went overseas. We have completely reversed that equation and in the process established some quite significant strategic capabilities in this country. Shipbuilding is but one example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is only fair that we should ask what is the Opposition's approach to defence industry policy. Given that it no longer adopts a bipartisan approach in this most fundamental area of government activity, will it continue this Government's commitment or will it dice it, as it has diced support generally for Australian industry? Can those Australian companies and Australians working in defence or defence related industries expect to see that any government support or government encouragement of Australian industry effort will be diced on the altar of zero tariffs, or whatever the general industry policy means in terms of failure to support Australian industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this happens, it will be most regrettable because, whilst we accept the general principle of self-reliance in terms of our fighting force, it is also an appropriate concept for industry policy. I will be very interested to hear what the Opposition has to say about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I took exception to in the contribution of the shadow Minister was his description of some of the Budget initiatives as make-work schemes; that is, the bringing forward of something like $66m-worth of repair and maintenance activity as make-work schemes. One could be forgiven for thinking that we had designed some special Skillshare scheme or some other scheme in the defence area. When the contractors are bidding for that work&mdash;it will be done by private enterprise&mdash;I think we should write to them and say, `The Opposition believes that you are indulging in make-work, some sham activity'. It is as if in the whole budget area of repair and maintenance there are two types of legitimate activities that private contractors undertake&mdash;those that constitute the standard part of the program and those that are brought forward. I have never heard so much nonsense as the Opposition's description of legitimate repair and maintenance work as make-work activities in Defence. </PARA>

In real terms, defence outlays have continued to fall. Our general thrust has been to look at how the $10 billion-odd is spent. We believe that there are areas where it can be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We question whether the expenditure is being put in the right place. We look at the fact that the Army has 2,487 clerks but only 3,102 riflemen. To our mind, there is something wrong with an army that has almost as many people sitting behind desks as it has people who can go out and fire a rifle at the enemy. That is our question, and I think it is a valid one. Our thrust will be to look at the Army, look at the ADF and look at where the money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will need to be convinced that we ought to reduce expenditure by a dollar. I am yet to be convinced about that, but I am talking here today about what the Government has done. I am not convinced from what I have heard in this debate or, indeed, in the time I have been in this place, that it has the commitment to defence that I believe we ought to have. The Budget is disappointing on defence, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chifley talks about job creation schemes. The Government is happy to have kids running around painting barbed wire fences, rocks and things. That is its idea of job creation. The irony of this Budget was that it was meant to be a job creating Budget, yet regular military numbers are to fall by 2,269 this financial year. It was an opportunity to create worthwhile jobs. Why not maintain the numbers in the ADF? Its people are doing something worth while, even if they are doing clerical tasks. I assume that the Government is convinced that they are doing something worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hypocrisy to talk about a job creating Budget at a time that the Government is cutting into Defence. We can see the reductions in numbers and job losses in the ADF since 1987. If we take the White Paper targets that were subscribed to by the Government, assuming that it took hold of all the recommendations, the job losses since then have been 18,000. Eighteen thousand jobs in the ADF have gone by the board. If the Government is serious about job creation&mdash;and it ought to be when it has created one million unemployed&mdash;why would it be reducing the number in the ADF in this climate? Honourable members opposite have it all back to front, I am afraid. The honourable member for Chifley probably knows that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate takes place in the shadow of last Saturday's dedication of the Vietnam memorial. I would like to say a couple of words about that in the context of defence and the Defence appropriation. Perhaps I can say a little more when we talk about veterans affairs later. It was a wonderful occasion for the 25,000 to 30,000 Vietnam veterans who participated on Saturday&mdash;not, I suspect, because they want the accolades of the Australian people or those who watched, although they deserve them, but more, I believe, because to a man the 50,000 Australians who served in Vietnam were proud of the service they gave to their country there. They served it well and they do not want to be patronised any more by people who somehow feel sorry for them, or think that they came back here to be denigrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of us did not come back to be denigrated at all. We were proud of our service there. I believe that the opposition to the Vietnam war has been overstated, that history will judge it to have been worth while and that the 504 young Australians who died there did not do so in vain. They died for God and Queen and country, and they did it with the same commitment to a cause as those Australians who have died in other wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten thousand Vietnam veterans have died since the end of the war. About 40,000 are still alive. At least 2,000 of those 10,000 who have died committed suicide. So the veterans continue to suffer. What they need, if anything, is not patronising but special, ongoing care and attention, as do veterans of all wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will stand up in this place at every opportunity to say how important it is that we have an ongoing commitment to the care of our veterans, because they deserve it and they need it. One of the ironies of last Saturday was the fact that an Australian flag was carried for each one of those 504 Australians who died, and there were many other Australian flags evident there on Saturday. I enjoyed seeing the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) forced to stand and salute the flag that he has denigrated so often as he has travelled around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this debate we should also focus again on the lessons of World War II. There is a prospect at the moment of a visit to Australia by Emperor Akihito. I do not believe that there is any reason at all why he should not be welcomed here. He is welcome here. Japan is our most important trading partner. In terms of defence, how quickly things change in the world. But many Australians still have vivid memories of World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have the great honour of being patron of the Gold Coast branch of the Ex-Prisoners of War Association. Its members are currently seeking through the United Nations reparations from the Japanese for the hardship that they suffered. They have not received one solitary cent in recognition of what they went through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young Emperor's father was a war criminal. He escaped justice for pragmatic reasons. Australia has never received from the Japanese Government, other than in very perfunctory terms on one occasion, a proper apology for what it did to our servicemen. We think about almost 8,000 Australians who were murdered on the Burma railway; 21 nurses who were machine-gunned down at Bangka Island; and 2,000 Australians who were executed on the forced march from Sandakan. They were shot in the back of the head one at a time when they could not march any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cultural significance of an apology does not escape me, because the Japanese have a problem with the word. Maybe they want to express regret and maybe they want to recognise that what they did to our fathers and some of our relatives was wrong, but they ought to say so. I do not believe that the Emperor's visit here should be contingent on an apology, but the ex-POWs are hopeful that they will get some recognition. They want more than just words; they want some tangible recognition. Many of them have suffered enormously. Their lives have been destroyed by the experiences they had at the hands of the Japanese during the Second World War. They really want action more than words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence is important. Unfortunately, it is a fact of life on this planet that we cannot be complacent about the peace that we have here. Ostensibly, we have had peace since 1945. Yet there have been some major conflicts since then which continue today. The post-communist era brings new challenges and new threats. I recently had the opportunity to visit the former Yugoslavia and particularly the republics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. My friend the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and I have spoken about our visit to Sarajevo only a few weeks ago. The purpose was to see and try to understand what is happening there. It reminds us that even that conflict has the potential to escalate. Ironically, the First World War also started in Sarajevo. There is some hope that the United Nations will have a greater role in peace making, but it will require more resources. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I am very pleased to see the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) at the table because the matter I want to raise comes squarely within his purview.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may not seem very significant to a whole lot of people but it is extraordinarily significant in not only the history of Sydney Harbour but also the history of the Australian Navy. Mr Truss, you will be all too familiar with the fact that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> took part in one of the great exercises of World War I when it answered a call from the Cocos Islands. Anybody who has been to the Cocos Islands will know what a strategic location they occupy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the morning of 9 November 1914 a raiding party from the German cruiser <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emden</EMPHASIS> went ashore on Direction Island with the object of wrecking the cable and wireless installations that were there. The inhabitants of the Cocos (Keeling) group were put off, to say the least, by this particular occurrence and sent out an SOS. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> arrived and in the engagement that followed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Emden</EMPHASIS> was set afire and forced to beach on North Keeling Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> had a very distinguished naval history. It was eventually paid off on 8 May 1928 and was broken up in January 1929 at Cockatoo Dock. The mast from that ship is presently located on Bradleys Head, just near Taronga Park Zoo. It is a special memorial for the Navy and for the people of Sydney. It is sited in a magnificent location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tradition of ships named Sydney has continued since that time. They have a very magnificent record within the naval history of this country. In fact, one of the great tragedies of World War II was the loss<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> </EMPHASIS>with all hands of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> off Carnarvon in Western Australia, when it was sunk in an encounter with the German raider <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kormoran</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wish to make today is that the mast of the original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>, occupying as it does such a prominent position on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour and of enormous significance for Australian naval history and the people who served on the various <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydneys</EMPHASIS>, is now in a state of some deterioration. There are very significant efforts being made to acquire the necessary money to properly refurbish the mast. I know that a request has been made to the Government for a contribution towards the restoration of the mast to a proper condition. As I understand it, at this stage no decision has been made. It is not a lot of money that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the significance of the mast, in terms of Australian naval history and particularly the men who served on the various <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydneys</EMPHASIS>, is very great indeed. Its position on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour in such a magnificent setting is one which I believe the Minister and the Government should actively take into consideration when the request for the money comes across his desk. As I say, it is a comparatively small amount of money but the significance and the symbolism of it are immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be a very worthwhile gesture on the part of the Government if this amount of money could be made available to those who are concerned with the restoration of the mast. I use this estimates debate today to bring home to the Minister's personal attention, whilst he is sitting in the chamber, the very worthwhile contribution that he himself could make. He could cement his name in the history of this mast by making money available. I know he is a Minister who likes to cement his name in various areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the debate I would first of all like to thank all those who have participated&mdash;and there have been a considerable number. Most people have made a useful contribution and I would like to deal with some of the points that have been raised. I might begin at the end with the contribution of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), concerning HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The request has not come to me as yet. Maybe it has come to my colleague the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) but I have not seen it. I certainly take on board his remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great mystery over the way in which HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> met her end has recently been the subject of some considerable controversy. At least one book is testimony to the aliveness, if you like, in the Australian consciousness of this great ship and those who served on her. I take very sympathetically the remarks which the honourable member has made. I do not want that to be taken as a promise that the Government can come to the party but, as the honourable member for Warringah would know, the Navy is a great preserver of the traditions of the Royal Australian Navy&mdash;the oldest of our Services&mdash;and I am certain that the Government will be as sympathetic as it possibly can be, given the limits on its finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now go to the question of defence expenditures because that was the theme of a number of contributions that have been made to the debate. Let us get absolutely clear that this Government has maintained defence expenditure pretty well in real terms in recent years. It will certainly do so in real terms for the appropriations we are now discussing. While it is the case that we will be reducing expenditure by a mere half of one per cent in the two out years, that does not compare with the kinds of cuts that the Opposition proposes to make to defence expenditure, and they are swinging cuts. It is a little difficult to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>; it is pretty clear that defence expenditure was an afterthought, that it was brought in as a balancing item when it was clear that there were already holes in the Fightback package. At the very minimum, one is looking at expenditure cuts in the Opposition's Fightback package of $50m in the first year, $150m in the second year and $200m in the third, making a total of $400m at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at how the Opposition proposes to save the money&mdash;and that is pretty clear: through making a lot of personnel redundant&mdash;I suspect that the cuts will be even more because, having examined carefully what the Opposition proposes to do, I do not believe that it can make those savings as quickly as it proposes to. One should bear in mind that when we have made savings in the past we have redirected those savings away from support areas into enhancing the combat capability of the ADF, something which the Opposition does not plan to do; it plans to make the savings and that is that. It will return them to Consolidated Revenue for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to my counterpart, the honourable member for Curtin, the shadow Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Rocher), in this place last night. He spent most of his time speaking about the question of redundancies and the ineligibility, as I believe he described it, of ADF personnel who have accepted a redundancy package to gain positions in the Australian Public Service. I am well aware that that is a matter of considerable concern to the ADF, as indeed it is to me. But I do need to point out that this is a dispute which is being resolved within the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Service Commission has a policy which quite understandably applies across the Public Service. Ex-Commonwealth employees, which includes former members of the ADF, who accept a redundancy package can be employed in the Australian Public Service only after a period equal to the term for which the redundancy benefit has been given. The fact that that policy applied to former ADF members was reaffirmed by the Commission on 11 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have since been discussions between the ADF, Defence and the Public Service Commissioner about this because there is no wish on the part of Defence or indeed of the Government to see individual members of the ADF disadvantaged. We have been in close discussion with the Public Service Commission, most recently on 28 September when representatives of the ADF and the Department of Defence raised the possibility of exemption of the ADF from the Public Service Commission policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to point out very clearly that the Public Service Commissioner is an independent statutory position. There is no way in which a government can possibly interfere with his statutory role so I need to make it clear that, when he does come to a final decision on this matter, we are obliged, as Ministers in this Government, to accept the verdict that he hands down. In fairness to the honourable member for Curtin, he did not really seek to imply that it was remiss of the Government that this situation had arisen, but we are certainly prepared to accept the decision of the umpire when that is finally made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) for his remarks in reaffirmation of the strategy behind the force structure review. Part of that obviously is of great benefit to his electorate of the Northern Territory as we increasingly move forces to the north as well as to the west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be proper for me to call on the Opposition spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), to come clean on the intentions of the Opposition in this regard. Considerable doubt has been cast by the statements of the honourable member for Mayo as to whether the Opposition is in fact committed to continue the policy of the move to the north, which under our Government will continue and is well under way with the move of the 2nd Calvary Division to Darwin. It is a matter of concern to me and to the residents of the Northern Territory that the Opposition does seem to be unwilling to commit itself to that entirely desirable move. I call upon the shadow Minister to make the Opposition's position clear on that important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) referred to the reduction in running costs embodied in the appropriations and sought to draw a connection between that reduction in running costs and the number of tragic accidents which have befallen RAAF aircraft in the last couple of years. I have to say that that is, not just in my opinion but in the opinion of the Services who are most expert on this, a total misreading of the situation. In the first place, the reduction in running costs is happening because of the reduction in support personnel, in support costs, and 100 per cent of those savings are being redirected into reinvestment, into enhancing our combat capability. Indeed, it is exactly what the Opposition says it will do on the savings side&mdash;that it will reduce the support, reduce the tail, as it were&mdash;except that the Opposition does not propose to reinvest 100 per cent of those savings in the combat capability end of the ADF. So the right honourable member for New England is quite wrong in suggesting that the reduction in support costs, the reduction in running costs, equates to a decline in anything that might suggest that RAAF accidents might occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second place, there is empirical evidence that the accidents have not taken place because of lack of resources or lack of flying hours. Each of those accidents has been exhaustively investigated in reports&mdash;with the one exception, and that is only a matter of timing&mdash;which have been made public and closely scrutinised. That has not been the conclusion of these exhaustive investigations. There is no way that this Government by skimping in this area would jeopardise the safety of people who fly in the RAAF or who serve as aircrew on aircraft. I take greatly amiss the suggestion that that would happen; what is more, the suggestion has been refuted in terms by the Chief of the Air Staff in a widely publicised <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program some weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same point was made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) in relation to the decline in flying hours which applied to a number of combat aircraft. The advice of the Royal Australian Air Force is that modern aircraft do not need to be flown as much to maintain the skills of pilots. As people who are perhaps better informed than the honourable member for Bendigo know, technology does a great deal of the actual flying of the aircraft. What is required is practice in handling the weapons systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one has sat in the cockpit of an F18 or an F16 and looked at the number of things that the pilot has to do with regard to controlling the weapons system of the aircraft, one can understand that that does require a lot of practice. But that practice is best done in simulators. That is done in modern air forces around the world. It is simply not the case that a pilot needs to have more flying hours in order to keep up the skills that are required for combat capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bendigo also referred to the decline in the number of uniformed people in the ADF. That point was also made by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster). What needs to be said is that the people who are either being remustered, as the honourable member for Macquarie spoke about, or who will no longer have careers in the ADF, are in support positions; they are not at the front line. The whole point of the force structure review to which we came last year was that we would be reducing support personnel and employing others in better careers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remustering, to which the honourable member for Macquarie referred, is intended precisely to provide the best possible careers for people in the RAAF. He asked rhetorically how it was possible to civilianise positions and save money when people in the Services work long hours without overtime but do get time in lieu. There is a simple answer to that. Servicemen, as is right and proper, are very highly paid people. It is possible to use civilians who cost a good deal less. Some say that it is 30 per cent less, but it does depend on the particular occupation, although one does not have the oncosts that one has with ADF personnel. There is no superannuation to be paid, there is no housing subsidy, and there is no free medical and dental treatment and so on. The cost of civilians is considerably lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to make it clear that we are not civilianising core functions; it is only non-core functions which we are looking at. I have a good example to illustrate that. The other day I signed a contract for the contracting out to a private contractor of the catering, messing and accommodation for 34 Squadron at RAAF Fairbairn. That included the provision of meals and so forth on the VIP aircraft. That job was previously done by 80 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAAF was invited, as we always do, to submit an in-house bid on how it could do it better. The RAAF's in-house bid involved using 42 people. In other words, it was able to save 38 people by adopting best practice and by doing things differently. It did not win the contract because the contractor himself came in a considerable percentage below that, in terms of cost, though hardly below it in terms of numbers. It is a very good example of how one can save a number of people in the support functions and then use those savings to enhance capability to do the things that the ADF professionally is about, rather than some of these other support functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the answer to honourable member for Macquarie. I might add that the lesson which the RAAF is learning from the contracting out process&mdash;indeed, all the ADF is learning from the contracting out process&mdash;is how to do things more efficiently within the core functions themselves. The catering at operational bases which will never be contracted out can be done more effectively and efficiently as a result of the lessons that are being learnt through contracting out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is rather a rambling, but I hope comprehensive, response to the points that have been made in this debate by honourable members. I thank everyone who participated. Finally, I was encouraged and heartened by the universal support for the professional qualities of the men and women who serve Australia's defence. They have a vital function, as do those who participate in the defence industry, which is dear to my heart as well as to the heart of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia is well served by its defence forces which are becoming leaner, more effective and more efficient as time goes on. I salute them just as I saluted, along with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), those who marched in Canberra last weekend. I was glad that so many of those who marched served in a logistic support capacity in the Vietnam War. As you will know, Mr Deputy Chairman, the Government decided only a matter of a month or six weeks ago to provide the recognition for which they have waited so long and which they so richly deserve. It is a great pleasure to have served in this portfolio and to have done by the ADF, I hope, the best that it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">In the time available to me I want to concentrate on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document which the Labor Government put out recently trying to answer the very positive policies for primary industry that the coalition has as part of Fightback and beyond Fightback. The part of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> that I wish to refer to is called `Farmers &amp; Rural Communities'. It is interesting that it concentrates on coalition policies and on criticising coalition policies simply because the Government does not have any primary industry policy itself. That is an interesting point to begin with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the criticism is not even accurate. The people who put <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> together are either liars or they have put it together in complete ignorance. For example, they say that basically farmers do not pay payroll tax or sales tax, or that it does not have any impact on the cost of production&mdash;the input costs that farmers as business people have to pay. Treasury's own document, which the Government required of Treasury to knock down Fightback and which did the opposite&mdash;it confirmed the $20 billion of business cost savings&mdash;states in the section on agriculture that the abolition of payroll tax will mean a saving in costs to farmers of $166m each year. The abolition of wholesale sales tax will mean a saving to farmers each year of $288m. The biggest saving is in dropping fuel excise which represents $697m, according to Treasury. If one then adds the costs from GST of $126m, one has the net savings to agriculture oncosts of over $1 billion per year, or an average of $8,000 per farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then moves on to fuel. Its tone changes at various stages of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> document when it talks about dropping the fuel excise. On the one hand, the Government tries to say that there is nothing to be gained by dropping fuel excise because, `Farmers who use diesel already get a rebate'. Of course, what those opposite do not say is that the rebate is only for tractors on the farm. As the NFF has stated, for farmers generally petrol is close to 50 per cent of the total fuel bill on farms used as businesses. Therefore, in the case of diesel, which is used in trucks and utilities, and petrol used by farmers&mdash;and for that matter Avgas which is used by those in more remote areas&mdash;it is obviously a very big saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then states, `Okay, if the fuel tax is dropped it will be taken up in a road user charge'. We have answered this claim time and time again. All of the allocation for road finance to match that of the Government is already met in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> document. Only one side of the Parliament is moving to a road user charge at the present time, and that is the Labor Government through the NRTC. The Government then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, if Federal petrol taxes are dropped, there would be nothing to stop the States from moving in with more of their own taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been stated quite clearly in Fightback that any State which moves in to pick up the void when Federal fuel excise is dropped will be met by a coalition government reducing the general purpose grants to the State by a similar amount. So it certainly will prevent the States from doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest furphy in this terrible document is the statement that `60 per cent of all farm and self-employed households would be worse off'. ACIL, which is an independent consulting group, was commissioned by the National Farmers Federation to investigate the benefits of Fightback for farmers. It basically confirmed the Treasury figures. But what is more significant in this context is that ACIL has shown that farm families in every income group which is used for statistical purposes&mdash;and there are 10 deciles or groups&mdash;would be better off as farm families, in addition to being better off as farm businesses. And the poorer families will be better off by a larger percentage than the rich. ACIL states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example farmers with an average income of $140.12&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the lowest decile group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would benefit by $15.16 a week or about 11 per cent whereas those in decile 4 on an average of $410.50 would benefit by $16.30 or about 5 per cent a week.</PARA>
<PARA>ACIL listed some of the reasons why farm families will be better off. The first point is that the farm family and the farm business are very much integrated, so obviously if the farm business is better off&mdash;and we have indicated that there will be an average of $8,000 per year in reduced farm costs&mdash;that will flow through to the farm family. Other Fightback initiatives include the doubling of family allowance for families with incomes less than $30,000 and smaller increases for families on higher incomes; a 6 per cent increase in the family allowance supplement; tax credits of up to $400 for low income families who take out private health insurance; abolition of the assets test for assistance for isolated children; the suspension of the assets test for Austudy payments for families suffering hardship; an increase in the dependent spouse rebate; no assets test for retirees living on the family farm; and personal income tax cuts, which are very significant in themselves and are targeted to the lower income groups which, unfortunately, incorporate most farmers. ACIL claims that the GST will add $16 a week to families' personal bills but this will be more than offset by the benefits of the package which I have listed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a family would need only the doubling of family allowance for just one child from $10 to $20 and a tank full of petrol in the car for private use&mdash;which is a saving of about $11&mdash;to see an improvement of more than $5 per week. If we then add the health fund rebate of up to $7.70 a week, together with a 30 per cent cut in personal tax, the benefits are considerable&mdash;and that is even before we come to the flow-through to the farm family from the farm business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no point in the Government saying that the ACIL report is not a valid one because the Government itself quotes ACIL in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poles Apart</EMPHASIS> with regard to the question of road user charge implications. I repeat: the only road user charge on the agenda at the present time is that of the Federal Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then moves on to sugar because it thinks by conning the sugar producers of Queensland it can gain some political mileage and save a few political skins, which after the Queensland election looks pretty doubtful anyway. It was Labor which removed the embargo on the importation of sugar and it was Labor which broke the agreement with regard to the specific duty rate tariff reductions. At this stage it is only the coalition which has rejected the Industry Commission report which says that there will be a zero tariff on sugar by 1998; the Government has not. Ours is a softer tariff reduction of down to 5 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 21 September edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Canegrower</EMPHASIS> carried an article which was quite wrong and I have sent a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canegrower</EMPHASIS> to correct it. The article said that our tariff for sugar will be zero in the year 2000. That is wrong; it will be 5 per cent. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canegrower</EMPHASIS> article also said that because of the DC preference for countries such as Fiji or Thailand, by the year 1998 the tariff would effectively be zero. That is wrong, because we also phase out developing country preferences. So the tariff for Fiji and Thailand, if they ever send sugar to this country, will also be 5 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Government is doing no such thing; it is maintaining developing country preferences. So what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canegrower</EMPHASIS> is saying might be true for us is more likely to be true for Labor, because that is where the tariff will bite if it maintains the developing country preference advantages. </PARA>

Our Landcare initiative&mdash;I think it involves something like $62m&mdash;is something which I think everyone in rural Australia would be very pleased with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very enlightened by the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), that the tariff on sugar would be 5 per cent by the year 2000. That is certainly in conflict with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>, where table 4.1 refers to the `elimination of all tariff and bounty assistance'. It is total and clear cut. I am pleased to see that the Deputy Leader of the National Party has walked away from table 4.1 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> and I believe the Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Hewson) has a difficulty with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue I would like to speak about initially in regard to agriculture is dumping. A lot of concern has been expressed, not only in the sugar industry but in other industries, about dumping. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Extra</EMPHASIS> program on 1 October this year the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), was interviewed about dumping. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you are right when you pick up the extra issue of dumping, and it is no good having a system which is really what happens now&mdash;somebody starts dumping on the Australian market&mdash;the Government I think requires something like&mdash;the dumped product has something like 20% of the market before they do anything.</PARA>
<PARA>I can understand why the Opposition has trouble selling Fightback if the shadow Treasurer fails to understand a simple procedure like anti-dumping. He is wrong, and so much so that I was embarrassed when I read the transcript of that interview. So today I am in the process of sending him a brochure from Australia's anti-dumping process, the faster investigation advisory service of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little embarrassed for the shadow Treasurer when in Queensland he made comments such as those which were not only confusing but very dumb. In fact, we have one of the fastest anti-dumping procedures in the world. It is GATT related. This lovely brochure&mdash;in clear, concise English&mdash;that I am sure the shadow Treasurer will be able to read in his office today to fully understand that we have faster measures than the United States, Canada and, of course, the EC. In fact, the Australian Customs Service has now established a shopfront advisory service called the Customs business liaison section which provides direct counselling and advice on anti-dumping procedures to firms, industry associations, small business consultants and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, just for the record and for the shadow Treasurer I would like to make this point: under the new arrangements Customs has 25 days, down from 35, to decide whether Australian industries' allegations have sufficient substance to warrant investigation. That is faster than some similar investigation periods in Canada and the EC. Customs then has a further 100 days, except in unusually difficult cases, to make a preliminary finding. Provisional anti-dumping measures can be put in place at that stage; that is, at 125 days. The anti-dumping authority, the ADA, then has a further 120 days to undertake a final inquiry. The whole process is 245 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the shadow Treasurer, someone who aspires to be Treasurer of this country, to make the comment that something like 20 per cent of a market would have to be lost for anti-dumping measures to proceed sadly reflects a poor understanding and sadly reflects an ignorance on the part of the shadow Treasurer. That is why I have sent him a copy of this lovely brochure for his information. I am sure he and the Leader of the Opposition will sit down and work out exactly what anti-dumping is all about. I think the shadow Treasurer's lack of understanding of agriculture goes even further. As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 24 September, when he was interviewed, there appears this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Reith gave no hope to sugar farmers wanting a relaxation on the Opposition's zero tariff policy.</PARA>
<PARA>This is at odds with the statement of the Deputy Leader of the National Party who said 5 per cent. The Nationals and the Liberals really do have a problem. I was pleased today to see that there is a wedge driven in on zero tariffs. It is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;table 4.1&mdash;for everyone to read. But the shadow Treasurer went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the high cost of sugar in Australia it has cost jobs in the Victorian confectionary industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again I think the shadow Treasurer seems to understand only that one puts sugar in one's tea, because the domestic price of sugar in Australia is the third cheapest domestic price in the world. We do not have a dear price on our sugar. I can assure the shadow Treasurer that if he does go up to Queensland, and if he does get out into the cane fields and get a bit of real dirt on his shoes&mdash;a bit of red soil and a bit of black soil, a bit of Burdekin soil&mdash;he will come to understand that those growers up there are not too happy with those sorts of silly comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that someone who aspires to be Treasurer of Australia simply does not understand some basic facts: firstly, about the domestic pricing for sugar and, secondly, about anti-dumping. Of course, there is massive confusion on the part of the Opposition as to what tariffs and dumping are all about. Tariffs have two effects: a tariff is a protective measure but it is also a price support measure. Every canefarmer knows that, and that is why the sugar industry is not very happy with the zero, scorched earth policy of the Opposition. Once again I was keen to see that the Deputy Leader of the National Party said 5 per cent tariffs. It is in total conflict with Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray, quoted from ACIL. I think there are some interesting things we can learn from ACIL. I am not discrediting the integrity or the ability of people from ACIL who have come out with the report. I am criticising, though, the sorts of figures they were given to come out with that report. We have been through a rural crisis in the last few years. I was criticised back in August 1990 when sugar was 14c a pound, when beef was good&mdash;just at the start of the embargo on Iraq&mdash;for saying that all of rural Australia was not in crisis. Cotton was booming at the time as well. A few months later the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) criticised me for not saying that rural Australia was in crisis. We still have crisis now in rural Australia, particularly because of the debt structures that farmers have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In table 4 of this ACIL report, put forward by the Opposition as a great guide as to why Fightback is so good, we need to recognise that these are the levels of farm income that have been highlighted to sell to the Opposition&mdash;particularly some of the National Party members in rural seats&mdash;about how great Fightback is. Mixed grain and wool farmers return, net income, $60,800; dry land dairying, $55,950; merino wool, $58,000, I think it reads, and Queensland beef is $71,000. But it is between $55,000 and $71,000 net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that I do not know many farmers in my electorate, and I am sure, Mr Deputy Chairman, that you would not know many farmers in your electorate earning that net income. In fact, the Queensland grain growers have done an investigation and found that 40 per cent of grain growers, those they were able to research and poll, are no longer viable without assistance from rural adjustment schemes and the like. The Queensland grain growers have shown that they are facing a very severe crisis, particularly in south-east and south-west Queensland. Most of those farmers will not have a net income at all; they will have a net loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To do an analysis on Fightback with those people and to say that they will be better off begs the question: what planet did either the NFF or those people on the other side of the chamber, to use that analogy, come from? Certainly according to the four tables I have mentioned those farmers were allegedly free of debt. There are not many farmers free of debt in this country. There are certainly some, but there are not many. The point I am making is that it is not that ACIL has acted in any fraudulent way, but that the figures that it has been given to work with are definitely fraudulent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to note recently in the Wagga Wagga <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Liberal</EMPHASIS> of 24 September that the shadow Minister for industrial relations, who many times is forthright and honest in his comments, was speaking about the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) who has shown, sometimes in the Opposition, some courage in speaking out on many issues. The shadow Minister for industrial relations said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I had a say he would be a minister in the next Coalition government. . . He supported me when I was Opposition leader during the great Coalition dispute and he spoke out against those mad Queenslanders.</PARA>
<PARA>There are some divisions and some difficulties on the other side of the House regarding Fightback, and over the next few months we will see that come out. When we have the shadow Treasurer of this country not understanding anti-dumping procedures, not understanding that we have the third cheapest domestic sugar in the world, going to Queensland and wondering why he is laughed at, he really does have a difficulty. I hope he has three sugars in his tea. I hope he will read this pamphlet from the Department to better understand what dumping measures are all about so that next time he does an interview he is better appraised of the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously in these estimates debates I would like to confine my comments today to my shadow portfolio responsibilities of tourism. In terms of tourism one of the greatest slaps in the face to the industry was that in fact tourism was not mentioned at all in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). Despite the fact that international tourism presently earns 10 per cent of our export earnings and creates 16 per cent of all new jobs in Australia, and that other industries such as farmers, miners and manufacturers were mentioned, there is not a word about tourism. I thought that an industry that really is one of the few white hopes for Australia could have been given greater consideration by the Treasurer on that night</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>in terms of its impact, or even an acknowledgment of the contribution that that industry is making, but in fact there was not a mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact when we go through the total Budget Papers we see there are only four paragraphs relating to tourism. Yet this is an industry that creates more foreign exchange for us and provides more employment than any other industry in the private sector. But this is all we get. I suppose it would be easy to say that in actual fact our international tourism performance is going fairly well and that it is easy to put it aside like that, but in reality there are a number of difficulties within the Australian tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might say the recession is over, one knows that the figures prove that it certainly is not over. One only has to look at the latest reports released just today by the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation to see that a number of our major tourist plants are in some trouble because people just cannot afford to stay there. Eighty per cent of the tourist industry is the domestic industry, and we are seeing a boom in caravan parks and in low cost flat accommodation, while a lot of Australia's very important infrastructure is being under-utilised because Australians just cannot afford to go there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government is very much for the promotion of Australia overseas, may I also say that we in the Opposition have some very real criticism of the way the Government is approaching the situation. We acknowledge that there has been quite a substantial increase in this Budget in terms of funding for the tourism vote and for the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the only real claim to fame that the Government can make in this Budget is that an additional $5.7m has been allocated this year to establish 54 new bureaucrats in the Department of Tourism. I would like to know the exact designation of those additional 50-odd bureaucrats because there does not seem to be anybody around this place or within the tourist industry who is able to tell me why we need this grossly expanded department when we have already got a Bureau of Tourism Research, the Australian Tourist Commission, and specialist departments to look after areas such as the environment. We plough up the bureaucracy once again and literally waste $5.7m which, quite frankly, could be better contributed towards the promotion of Australia overseas, to create those jobs, and to provide that foreign exchange that this country so urgently needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties in government will have no hesitation in trimming that department to what it should be, a very small policy division. The guaranteed funds will be flowing all towards the Australian Tourist Commission which will become a hard-nosed overseas promotional vehicle. When we do that, we will cut the Australian Tourist Commission away from the shackles of the public service with a full private enterprise board with a charter that will require its prime object in life to go overseas and to promote Australia. It is most important that at this time, when tourism is one of the few industries that has the capacity to be able to provide jobs and foreign exchange, that the majority of our contribution from Commonwealth funds goes into that promotion overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions that will have to be made about Australian tourism over the next 18 months to two years are the most important in the industry's history. If we play our cards right, we have a great opportunity to become a major force in world tourism. In their studies of last year, the world tourism organisation estimated that by the year 2000 140 million Asians will be travelling offshore for their holidays annually. If Australia got 5 per cent of that business, we could not handle it. Yet when we look at the Budget figures and at the work that is being done by State governments and local governments, I do not think there is yet a realisation in the bureaucracies of those three levels of government of what a tremendous impact the tourist industry can make on this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to reach the present figures of 7.2 million international visitors by the year 2000&mdash;and, incidentally, the coalition has plans to go way beyond that figure&mdash;the sorts of investment decisions that will have to be made and the sorts of infrastructural requirements that will have to be to be effected in Australia will have to be agreed in the next couple of years. While there are some people in the industry who say that the projections of the requirement of 386 new hotels in Australia of 250 rooms each really are fairyland stuff, I believe that they are not if one looks towards the growth of tourism into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government made some move in the One Nation statement this year to increase the rate of depreciation and hailed that as a major contributor to attracting investment into the tourist industry. I can tell the Government that there are no new major hotel projects under way in Australia at the moment as a result of that particular move. It is all very well, very handy and necessary to have those accelerated depreciation rates, but the facts of life are that unless these organisations are making a profit, they are not much good at all. There have to be other incentives to make sure we can get Australians&mdash;Australian banks and Australian financial institutions&mdash;re-investing in the industry once again. That will be a critical requirement if we are to take our share of that enormous world tourist trade that is sitting out there at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the infrastructure that we have got around Australia, issues concerning our airports, roads and sewerage systems must be addressed as a matter of urgency because it is important that we do have a properly planned tourist industry in the future. If we look at those projected figures of 7.2 million international visitors, we are looking at doubling the amount of international airline capacity coming into Australia over the next seven years and at 1 1/2 times the domestic airline capacity to be able to handle that business. While we can sit in here and talk about a third runway for Sydney, the facts of life are that the Sydney airport is going to be chock-a-block by about 1998 and we have to address issues such as a new airport for Sydney and what we are going to do with Badgerys Creek. The Opposition, of course, has plans for this and we have made it quite clear that we are going to privatise the airport system in Australia and let Badgerys Creek out for tender so that we can get that facility on line as fast as we possibly can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to make sure that there is a knowledge of the tremendous opportunities that are going to arise, especially for rural tourism. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) may be interested in this because his area is one that can certainly benefit. There will be tremendous opportunities under the CER arrangements with New Zealand. I do not think people have really thought through the advantages that they are going to be able to provide for us in terms of cheaper international airfares between Australia and New Zealand, increased competition and the capacity to be able to promote overseas the dual destinations of Australia and New Zealand, along with the Pacific Islands&mdash;and a whole new world that that is going to open up for us, especially in terms of the Asian market, the North American market and the fast growing ecotourism market out of Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a great shame that in this year's Budget we have not seen what I believe should have been a total commitment, and a commitment on the record, on what really should be done if we are going to make tourism work in this country. In reality there are very few industries that have the capacity to be able to provide real jobs for young Australians; in the short to medium term, it is going to be very much tourism and hospitality that have the capacity to provide those jobs and that wealth. The figure that was released in 1978 by the Bureau of Industry Economics should never be forgotten: every time we have a net increase of 25,000 international visitors into Australia, we create another 1,400 jobs. Every artificial device that has been put in the way of stopping the growth of international tourism into Australia must go, because we owe that to our kids. In terms of our international performance, we owe it to get it right so that we can earn those dollars that tourism can create. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some comments on the tourism allocations are most applicable. I agree with the honourable member for Fadden on one or two points that he raised. Certainly the potential for growth in the tourism industry has been realised and will be realised with decisions that are made now and not in the future. The honourable member for Fadden alluded to some of the decisions that have been made. He did not seem to give a great deal of credence to their effect, but they certainly are having an effect upon investment in the industry&mdash;particularly the changes to taxation, including the amortisation rate for short term travel accommodation, which was increased from 2 1/2 per cent per annum to some 4 per cent, thus allowing capital costs to be written off over 25 years instead of 40. The introduction of a development allowance for eligible projects involving capital costs exceeding $50m has also encouraged investment in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fadden mentioned that 10 per cent of our present export earnings are attributable to tourism. The figure is correct and it is up from 6 per cent in 1980. Undoubtedly the tourism industry does have tremendous potential, and that potential will be realised if the whole industry is managed correctly. I compliment the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) for his work thus far. He certainly looked at the figures, projected them and said yes, we will make decisions today about benefiting both domestic and international tourism in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to hear comments lamenting the fact that people cannot afford to pay to get into certain holiday destinations. Quite frankly, some of the prices that some of those destinations charge are a little bit frightening. I do not know what incomes the honourable member for Fadden imagines Australians are on, but I think you, Mr Deputy Chairman, know some of the destinations that I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic tourists&mdash;indeed, a lot of the inbound international tourists&mdash;are not looking for five-star expensive holiday accommodation but for what has been described as the ecotourism route. That certainly is one aspect of Australian tourism that has great potential. How can the domestic tourism industry survive without the sorts of things that we have done, such as the deregulation of the airlines, which saw air fares come down and tourist traffic increase? How could the tourism industry in an area such as the electorate of Richmond survive or indeed grow with the impact of a GST on domestic holiday costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from a study by Ernst and Young that the estimated impact of the GST on the price of meals would be between 10 and 14 per cent. The increase in alcohol costs would be from 4 to 8 per cent. Perhaps we could do without the alcohol anyway. I will not debate that point with anyone. But the general increases in the cost of services will impact adversely on the tourism industry, particularly in my area, which is just below the Gold Coast, where there are lavish holiday homes, hotels and five-star accommodation. In my area we have tended to stick to family based tourism, catering for people on lower incomes who bring along a tent or caravan and like to park near the beach to get away from the bitumen and concrete type cell. They are the main ones who will be deterred by the impact of a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the local government areas of Ballina, Byron and Tweed are very concerned about a GST impost and how it will turn away domestic tourism. It will have the effect of making caravan parks and open spaces less viable in their present configuration and at risk of being taken over by a large multinational company that wants to put up four- or five-star accommodation and charge those exorbitant rates which the honourable member for Fadden admitted do not exactly encourage domestic tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in committee we are also deliberating on the agricultural industries. My area has several industries which, as you know, Mr Truss, are very crucial to Australia's domestic and export production. One is the sugar industry, which you would be quite familiar with. It provides a substantial part of the income of the north coast of New South Wales. The dairy industry is not so large; nevertheless it is a major industry and is particularly important because of its value adding. The horticultural industries are becoming increasingly significant. Stone fruit, a sunrise industry, now attracts some $38m in income to the area. Other crops such as tea and coffee are taking up a much greater share of import replacement and hence benefiting the overall economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention some policies that do not necessarily impact directly on my electorate because, I guess, I am blessed with an area that has an adequate and reasonably reliable rainfall&mdash;though at the present stage, I might add, it could certainly do with a little bit of rain. Our driest period is at this time of the year. Fortunately, unlike Queensland, we are not often drought declared. I think for 19 of 22 years Queensland was drought declared, rightly or wrongly. On the north coast we would be unlikely to have more than two years out of 22 with that problem. However, I realise that the national drought policy and initiatives such as the income equalisation deposits which have been enhanced in this Budget are the sorts of things that we need to boost the agricultural industries and to maintain their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from a rural background as I do, I certainly have empathy with not just north coast industries but other industries right across Australia as to their variability and in relation to the sorts of things that we need to do to address that viability and to ensure that the maximisation of export income as well as our domestic industries are maintained. I mentioned the dairy industry in terms of its value adding and certainly Norco is one industry which is recognised Australia-wide, and indeed internationally, as a go ahead company or cooperative. It is a major employer in the Lismore area, not to mention other parts of the electorate. The dairy industry is most appreciative of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) for his report and implementation of the package of measures that he recently brought in to maintain the viability of that industry. Certainly I know that that is reflected not just by the dairy farmers on the far north coast in my electorate but also by the dairy farmers both throughout Queensland and particularly in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national drought policy was one which was based on self-reliance, risk management and whole farm planning and it recognises drought as a natural feature of the Australian climate. It has put money into land care and drought education and training and particularly drought communication research. It has also allocated money for extreme drought assistance for New South Wales and Queensland. I think the other aspect that primary industry was actually lacking was the income equalisation deposit scheme. I know these were brought in some time ago but the enhancement that has been added to that to ensure that the farmers are able to take advantage of the good years in a fair way is going to go a long way towards actually getting over that little bit of a hurdle which the rural adjustment scheme has to address every now and again. It is the case that even today it is addressing massive amounts of underwriting by financial assistance for the rural sector and I see the income equalisation deposits as going a long way towards assisting there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I talk about the primary industry aspects of this debate I shall make a brief comment about Badgerys Creek which was referred to by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). Recently, as Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I was involved in a public hearing on that particular subject. I do not want to pre-empt what that Committee might recommend to this Parliament, but from a personal viewpoint all I can say at this point in time is that we appear to have a mickey mouse proposal put forward simply as a measure of injecting a very large amount of capital expenditure into what one might cynically say is a Australian Labor Party stronghold. Certainly, for my part, I will need to be convinced a lot more before I can agree to what the Federal Airports Corporation is recommending at this point in time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to briefly say a little about economic growth, about productivity, about the international trading processes, about competitiveness, about tax regimes and about all of their implications for the rural sector. Very briefly I shall make some comments about the rural adjustment scheme and the new drought measures. With unemployment at distressing high levels and a Federal election arguably only months away, the political imperative is for a rapid economic recovery. This will be a particularly difficult task, given the absence of a major stimulus from abroad which in the past has underpinned many of our recoveries. Indeed the downturn in Japan threatens to reverse the recent tentative upswing in commodity prices. Perhaps in recognition of this, or for other reasons known increasingly only to itself, this Government's One Nation statement forecasts a slower recovery in 1992-93 of 4.75 per cent GDP growth than in 1983-84 of a 6 per cent growth with only a modest rebound in unemployment which would be up by 2.25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Driving the recovery in 1992-93 is a forecast 2.5 per cent pick up in productivity. Over the four years to 1995-96 the Government hopes that productivity growth will average 1.5 per cent per annum compared to 0.9 per cent in the 1980s. In most quarters this productivity forecast generally has been regarded, to be kind, as being far too optimistic. The Government has pointed to a number of measures in its One Nation statement which it believes will encourage investment and hence boost the supply capacity and response of the economy. These include, of course, $1.1 billion expenditure on transport and communications infrastructure, accelerated depreciation allowance for plant and equipment, 10 per cent development allowances for selected large scale investments, modifications to the accord to achieve inflation consistent with that of our major trading partners and, finally, a continued program of so-called micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not the productivity forecast is too optimistic is only, it seems to me, a secondary question. What is more important is the recognition that without a sharp and sustained improvement in our productivity performance, we will not only fail to improve our eighteenth position in the league of nations but we will continue to experience a falling standard of living. Higher private saving will be needed if we are to retain the significant gains in our trade performance as investment spending and hence imports pick up. Productivity is also an important part of our ability to compete on international markets. Over the last three decades, Australia's combination of productivity and saving was middling by OECD standards. This situation deteriorated during the 1980s as growth in total factor productivity fell to about half that of the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect on competitiveness of this poor relative productivity performance was exacerbated by cost increases which consistently exceeded the OECD average. To some extent this loss of competitiveness was compensated for by a lower exchange rate but between 1987 and 1992 Australia's exchange rate adjusted competitive position still deteriorated by about 20 per cent. In contrast competitiveness improved by about 20 per cent in the United States and by about 15 per cent in Japan and New Zealand. Admittedly, there have been some productivity gains in some government business enterprises and by past Australian standards, we have lifted our game. However, so has the rest of the world and most recently Argentina, for example, has embarked on a radical program of deregulation, privatisation and reform of labour laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Closer to home, New Zealand's productivity growth has averaged 6 per cent over the last three years. Behind this there have been massive jumps in efficiency in a wide range of sectors, notably ports, where productivity increased by 100 per cent compared to increases here of around 30 per cent. Similarly, as Australia moved slowly to enterprise bargaining, New Zealand moved quickly to free up the labour markets with the Employment Contracts Act. Contrary to predictions of an industrial free for all, strikes are at an all time low. There has been no inflationary surge and employers are devoting significant resources to people management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competitiveness also is affected by tax imposts. According to official Treasury estimates, the Coalition's promised abolition of wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excises, and the introduction of a 15 per cent broad based goods and services tax would reduce net industry costs by $4.464 billion. Of that, 25 per cent flows on to the rural sector&mdash;$1,500 to $1,600, on average, for each of the 125,000 farms. Furthermore, the cost of producing exports would fall by $1.976 billion or 3 per cent and the cost of investment by $1.9 billion or 2.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major area of business costs is interest payments. Despite significant falls in inflation, real business rates remain uncomfortably high. Moreover, real long term interest rates remain two to three percentage points above the average for major OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in turn supports the exchange rate. After two decades of high inflation relative to overseas, markets do not believe that the current low rates of inflation will be sustained as economic recovery occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fully capitalise on the benefits of improved competitiveness requires that resources are not attracted into less efficient sectors by tariffs and by other forms of protection for favoured industries. The Prime Minister acknowledged this himself in announcing in May 1988 the review of industry assistance in which he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assistance provided to one industry hinders the development of others. One industry's assistance is frequently another's impediment. . . the sharpest focus must be on areas of highest assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore it is particularly counter-productive for the Government to hold tariff protection to selected industries at levels well above the majority of other industries. If agriculture must compete against corrupted world prices with only a 5 per cent tariff then so should those manufacturers who continue to receive special tariff treatment. As a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine survey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The urgency of labour, land and other reforms is misunderstood by those who like to think agriculture will loom far less large in the future than it has in the past. Rural Australia accounts for only 3-4% of the gross national product; but even when handicapped by an agricultural slump, and by dumping by the United States and the EC, it still produces about a quarter of Australia's merchandise exports. As it integrates itself more into the world economy, Australia's comparative advantages will lie more than ever in its natural resources and its natural beauty.</PARA>
<PARA>I will finish by making a brief comment about the rural adjustment scheme and the new drought measures, both of which we support in general, but, as the shadow Minister for primary industries has said on a number of occasions, we still have some deep reservations about the effectiveness of those measures which seem to be forcing farmers off their land rather than giving them the necessary financial, tax and other incentives to keep them where they do things best, and that is producing on the farm. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Rural Australia will, of course, benefit greatly from the initiatives announced in the recent Budget and the matters that we are debating here today. But, Mr Deputy Chairman, you may recall that in July this year the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) put out a joint statement on Australian agri-food industries, and the initiatives in the Budget enhance that statement. The Ministers highlighted the need for Australia to enhance our food processing areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that I am following the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). We are neighbours in our electorates and a part of the electorate of the honourable member for Groom, around the Laidley-Lockyer Valley area, has now come into my electorate. Over recent times I have spent a fair bit of time there looking at the opportunities that are available. I have also looked at a business there, Adams Foods, which does a lot of food processing from the vegetables that are produced in the Lockyer Valley. In addition, it also does a lot of food processing for products right throughout Australia depending on the seasons. I believe there are great opportunities to improve quite dramatically our food processing processes within Australia and also internationally. The initiatives by the Ministers to which I have referred cover those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to cover a number of points today but in the time allocated it might be a little difficult. Those matters are  food processing, countrylink, the radioactive waste repository that was covered in the Budget and also the land care and environment action program for young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn first to the LEAP program, to use the jargon. It is a program that has a lot of potential for young people, and of course it is hoped that through the training and employment opportunities that are available some 6,000 young people will actually benefit. A lot of that came out in the national employment and training program brought in by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and of course the Appropriation Bills now make that funding available. Funding is being provided through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In my local area I have a very effective Landcare group which I established some three years ago in the Brisbane Valley, and I hope it will be taking up the initiatives involved in this program. Also there is a local environment group called Envirocare, which will also be interested in taking on some of the initiatives that can help in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land care is probably the biggest environmental problem that we face today and I am sure you, Mr Truss, having an almost 100 per cent rural electorate, would probably understand the reasons I talk about land care. It is obviously very important. I do not think the environment is just about planting a few trees. I think we have got to look at the whole land care question&mdash;what has happened to our land and how we need to preserve it. So I believe if it is handled correctly, and I am sure it will be, the landcare and environment action program will go a long way towards addressing a lot of those issues in our rural sector today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to come back to the food processing area and value adding. Through the Budget the Government will provide some $12.7m over four years to the Primary Industries and Energy and Industry, Technology and Commerce portfolios to fund a range of measures to boost exports of fresh and processed foods, particularly to Asia. The Prime Minister just recently highlighted where Australia's future in trade is, and it is certainly in the Asian region. I do not believe any thinking Australian would deny that. There is a huge market there, and Australia really has the opportunity to produce the food that we need for our own use and also enough to move very briskly into that Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's food processing industry exports in total approximately $2.3 billion each year, which is an encouraging base when it comes to value adding. One of the Caucus committees I am involved with at the moment is actually looking at value adding, and just recently had the opportunity to look at a couple of industries in my own electorate&mdash;the Steggles chicken processing operation and Portion Control Foods, which also produces a lot of value added meat export products. I think that has been a very good initiative by them. Both those companies are moving ahead in leaps and bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think we have a great opportunity to expand value adding in our food processing area. As I said, the Lockyer Valley and the Brisbane Valley, in south-eastern Queensland, have a lot of potential as far as food growing and processing are concerned. The employment opportunities are extensive and I think we should take every advantage of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to turn to the radioactive waste repository which is also included in the Budget. I congratulate the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on getting these initiatives into the Budget. Some $350,000 is provided in 1992-93 for studies to identify suitable sites for a national radioactive waste repository, and $30,000 a year over four years from 1992-93 for Australian representation at international scientific forums on radioactive waste disposal. I believe that this is a very crucial industry. Perhaps it is not so much an industry, but it is an area that deserves more attention than it has had in the past. Recently the Public Accounts Committee, looking at research and development, highlighted the need to move in this area and get something going very quickly. Australia does produce a small quantity of radioactive waste, but at the present time we do not have a national repository. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been extensive discussion of this in my electorate, even though Queensland produces very little radioactive waste. In New South Wales there are obviously greater needs that have been highlighted, but I understand that a committee is looking at this at the moment and that the Minister has been moving very briskly to make sure that a report is forthcoming very soon and that initiatives are taken to develop a radioactive waste facility or repository to meet all Australia's needs. Of course, that will not take away from the State governments any of the responsibilities to have some sort of interim storage facilities; that is a matter for the States to determine as waste is produced from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, radioactive waste is one of those things that are here to stay. There are many pluses in the health area, particularly, where we produce radioactive waste and we really do need to ensure that it is stored correctly, meeting all the international standards. I am sure that the initiatives taken by the Minister will ensure that that actually does happen. I look forward to the responses to the committee report and to the cooperation of the whole community, both the industry where radioactive waste is developed and also the respective State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the couple of minutes remaining, I want to talk about the role of the countrylink program. The Government is providing $400,000 a year over the next four years to expand the countrylink program. Perhaps we do not highlight what countrylink does in a lot of areas, but I believe it has been a very worthwhile program for communication with our local electorates. I have had the opportunity to have a countrylink stand in rural parts of my electorate. I have had one in the shire office of the Esk Shire Council, which has moved out of my electorate now but which was in my electorate. At the present time I have got a countrylink stand that was provided to my electorate in the post office at Laidley. I have had the opportunity to put country link stands in those sorts of places and I have had a lot of cooperation from the local community in providing the information that is essential to our rural communities. I commend the Government on its initiatives in providing additional funding to continue that program. Mr Deputy Chairman, I thank you for your indulgence. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1557" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which suggests that the delay in the float of Qantas is likely&mdash;it attributes those remarks to me&mdash;and that the trade sale could also be delayed. The article is incorrect. I did not say to the Caucus yesterday that the delay in the float was likely. I also did not say that there was any reason to believe that the trade sale would be delayed. I am grateful to the honourable member for Dobell for his question because it gives me a chance to make the position clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts of the sale are these: firstly, the sale is proceeding on the basis that 100 per cent of the merged Qantas-Australian Airlines will be sold through both the trade sale and the float, with 51 per cent to be sold by way of the float. The trade sale is now in its final stage. There are three bidding groups&mdash;that is, British Airways, Singapore Airlines, and Air New Zealand and Brierleys&mdash;which are currently undertaking buyer due diligence conducted in data rooms specifically set up in Sydney for that purpose. They opened on 15 September and will conduct that due diligence until about mid-November, after which time they will be required to make final bids. The Government will then have to decide which of those bids, if any, it will accept. We expect that it will be able to make that decision by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not locked into a trade sale. If the bids are not good enough, we can reject all of them and make the whole sale through a float. But there is no reason to expect that we will get unsatisfactory bids. In fact, we have three interested bidders and we also have a prestigious asset for sale. In that respect, I advise the House that today Qantas has released its profit figures for 1991-92, which show that last year it made an after-tax profit of $137m, which compares to an after-tax profit of $44m in the previous year. However, I think that understates the degree of turnaround, because the pre-tax profit on operations before abnormals this year was $103m, compared with a loss of $158.6m in the previous year. So there has been a $260m turnaround in the pre-tax profit on operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very substantial performance indeed, particularly in the circumstances of an international aviation industry which has been going through hard times and which collectively in 1991 made losses totalling about $5 1/2 billion. So Qantas's performance was very good in the circumstances. We have an attractive asset and there is no need to believe that the bids will not reflect that, especially as the asset has been made more attractive by Qantas's acquisition of Australian Airlines and the efficiencies that will be able to be realised, which should result in a significant improvement at the bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preparations for the float are proceeding concurrently with the trade sale. That includes inviting proposals from financial houses of Australia for appointment as the lead manager underwriter for the float, which appointment should be made next month. The earliest date on which a float can be conducted, though, is late March of next year. Whether we conduct a float at that time will depend on a number of factors which will determine the prevailing circumstances. One is the state of the capital markets. Obviously, we are aware that at present both here and in other Western, developed countries capital markets are looking less than attractive to people who want to make floats. In those circumstances it has not been propitious for a couple of major floats to be a success at this time, with one failure and one float aborted. Whether that will still be the case in six months time is a matter of conjecture. Certainly, with both the Australian and international economies projected to improve next year, we have reasonable expectations that things will be looking better then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor is the state of the international and domestic aviation markets and the consequent attractiveness of the airline stocks at that time. Another factor would be the timing of the Federal election, which could interfere with the timing of the float that would otherwise apply. These are all factors that will have to be assessed as we move nearer to the time when the float is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the question, let me say that it is quite wrong for the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> to suggest that the Government is saying that a delay is likely. We are simply saying that it is possible. Whether it occurs or not will depend on the prevailing circumstances in March of next year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Mr Argus did say in passing was that the stance of fiscal policy in the medium term was too loose. It was clear from what Mr Argus had to say that he implicitly supported the need for a fiscal stimulus. He was talking about the impact of personal income tax cuts in 1995-96 and whether or not they should be introduced. Elsewhere in his speech Mr Argus said that he believed these tax cuts should be forgone in favour of providing further tax cuts and further incentives for businesses and for individuals to save. What this means is that he would have us replacing public saving&mdash;because you would provide tax cuts for business and others&mdash;with private savings but, as a consequence of that, fiscal policy must be loosened in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I was interested in the remarks of Mr Argus about benchmarking governments. I thought it was particularly worth while benchmarking Australia against a number of other countries. For instance, our forecast Budget deficit for this year is 3.3 per cent of GDP. We can compare that with a number of notable countries overseas:  in the United States it is 6 per cent; in Germany it is 3 1/2 per cent, which grossly understates the real position because so much of its public expenditure on the reunification process is off Budget; in Canada it is 3.8 per cent; and in the United Kingdom it is between 5 and 6 per cent. If we were to compare Australia with the United States or the United Kingdom and if we had the same percentage Budget deficit as them, our Budget deficit would not be $13 1/2 billion; it would be $25 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, this is after we have provided the fiscal stimulus which so many in the community, if not the Opposition, believe to be important in terms of promoting recovery in Australia. Indeed, there are many in the United States who wish that that country and its Budget had the capacity to deliver a fiscal stimulus in order to promote recovery in the United States. But it was because of the action that we took in the 1980s&mdash;Japan and Australia were about the only two countries in the world who took the opportunity to repair their Budgets&mdash;that we had the opportunity to provide that stimulus. It is for that reason that our general government gross debt to GDP ratio was 15 1/2 per cent in 1991, which was less than half of that in United Kingdom, one-quarter of that in the United States and about one-quarter of that for the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think it is a fair enough proposition of Mr Argus for us to benchmark the achievements of Australia, and indeed our fiscal position, compared with those of many other countries around the world. We might also benchmark the growth in the Australian economy because our economy has grown by 1.6 per cent in the four quarters to June of 1992 whereas in Germany and Canada growth in that four-quarter period was less than one per cent. In the United Kingdom, there have been eight quarters of either negative or zero growth and in the United States, although the history has been much more erratic, its total growth has been about the same as ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the comparison goes on. We are one of the lowest taxed countries in the world with a GDP ratio in terms of tax revenue of 31 per cent, along with the lowest in the United States and Japan. As far as industrial disputes are concerned we are below the OECD average, and of course we have had our lowest level for 30 years. Our trade performance has improved markedly in the course of the 1980s, with exports representing 23 per cent compared with 15 per cent 10 years ago. Crucially importantly, our inflation rate is the second lowest in the OECD, and the lowest that we have had for 30 years. So I welcome the opportunity as offered to us by Mr Argus to benchmark Australia's performance in not only the economy but also the public sector and compare it with that of the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also in an article from Max Walsh that he refers to Mr Argus's meeting with New York investors earlier this year in which he was told that fiscal stimulus was anathema. I hope Mr Argus took the opportunity to explain why our circumstances were different, why we have the capacity and the case for providing a fiscal stimulus. I hope that Mr Argus also took the opportunity as a loyal Australian to argue the case for the great improvement that Australia has realised over the course of the last decade. It is important for Australian business men and women, when they travel overseas and have the opportunity to sell Australia, to make the point that Australia's improvement has been substantial&mdash;that, indeed, there are many other countries that would like to have had the kind of success and have made the kind of progress that we have made over the 1980s. I am sure Mr Argus would carry out that obligation.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1561" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. As the honourable member will be aware, the Government has provided unprecedented funding stability and security to non-government schools through to the year 2000. Non-government schools are presently divided into 12 categories of need and the lowest subsidies go to schools in categories 1 and 2, which tend to include some of the older, well established private schools with substantial access to private sources of funding, through to category 12. In category 12 of course there are schools that are taking care of some of the most deeply underprivileged people in our community such as members of the Aboriginal community. The substantial number of schools are, of course, in category 10, which picks up most of those schools in the Catholic system. As a result of the propositions put forward in the Budget, we have provided over the next eight years substantial real annual increases for schools in categories 5 to 12 while schools in categories 1 to 4 will have their grants indexed to keep up with inflation, and we will also increase expenditure on school buildings capital grants by about $40m a year over the next four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangements will continue the stability and predictability of funding that we have put in place for the non-government school sector. Since the Budget, it has become obvious to the schools with an interest in these matters what the Government intends, and they have expressed themselves very favourably on what has been put forward. In contrast to that stability, we have been circulating proposals emanating from the Opposition in three particular areas which are of considerable concern to the community. One is to collapse the categories from their current twelvefold structure to six and to substantially increase funding in the upper categories&mdash;effectively, by some 66 per cent. The second is to guarantee real increases in funding no further than four years, not the eight years currently proposed by the Government. The third is to completely abandon the new schools policy that the Government has applied. That new schools policy gives stability to schools in both the government and the private sectors by ensuring that we do not willy-nilly create schools in areas where there is already substantial provision and, particularly in a period of recession, do not create a situation where the stability of funding of particular private schools would be threatened.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had the opportunity to participate in a discussion with the Opposition spokesman on education, the honourable member for Goldstein, who suggested to us that we had by this process precluded the creation of some 40,000 places&mdash;I quote him directly&mdash;over five years in the non-government sector. Within the Opposition policy for new schools proposals there is an amount of some $10m. If those 40,000 places are going to be funded by that $10m, that amounts to a sum of $250 per place. The lowest category in terms of the provision that we make, category 1, is an amount of $690 per student place; and for the highest category, category 12, the amount is $2,100. In category 6, in the middle of the range, it is about $1,500 per student place. The Opposition has clearly invented a new category and the category is to be funded at $250. I do not particularly know how the Opposition is going to operate this particular category, because it has not been included in anything that the Opposition has had to say so far.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing initiatives in this year's Budget will accelerate and underpin the growth in jobs and incomes. The Government has firmly indicated its commitment to public housing, offering the States and Territories $4 billion over the next four years to build and buy housing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives alone will result in an accelerated creation of some 1,600 jobs. The shared home ownership scheme which was announced in the Budget will ultimately mean some 20,000 households will be assisted and obviously that, together with funding for the better cities program, will result in a very substantial growth in employment and housing-related industries over the next two or three years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in contrast to some comparable countries, Australia is in a flexible and responsive position. The Treasurer commented recently on remarks proffered to Mr Argus about the United States. The United States has a fiscal budget deficit of 6 per cent of GDP. Why has it? The answer is that in the good times it did not pull the deficit into surplus, that is why. Now it cannot use fiscal policy whatsoever to stimulate its economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor of the US Federal Reserve has interest rates below the inflation rate and has said he hopes that the Japanese fiscal package works for the western economies. In other words, the Governor of the US Federal Reserve is hoping the Japanese Ministry of Finance package of 2 to 3 per cent of GDP will fire the western economies back into action. There has been pressure on the Bundesbank to reduce interest because the Bundesbank's policy has been killing the US dollar and the US economy. This is because largely flexibility is not available in some of those economies. It is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the Government has embarked upon an expansionary fiscal policy. But again we will bring the Budget back into within half to one per cent of GDP and afford the tax cuts by the measures announced by the Treasurer recently in the middle 1990s. Again, Australia will return as a country with low government debt to GDP back into Budget balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is the fundamentals in the economy are right for the economy to strengthen further. Productivity is trending upwards. Low interest rates and low inflation obtain in the economy. Profits and balance sheets are recovering and exports continue to trend upwards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now exporting nearly a quarter of all we produce. In 1982-83 we were exporting 14 per cent of GDP. This year we are exporting 23 per cent of GDP. The difference is 9 per cent of GDP or in today's terms $36,000m worth of exports that we did not have a decade ago. Could one imagine where Australia would be today if there were $36 billion less in exports in those external accounts? Australia would be referred to as a country which was resource rich, which had great promise, but which had never made it and had dropped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this Government saved Australia by getting up to one-quarter per cent of GDP. It saved us from not being able to pay for our imports. It saved us from relying on wheat, wool and minerals.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the great growth in our exports is now in elaborately transformed manufactures and manufacturing exports in general. It is one of the reasons why the economy is growing. It is a great mystery to those opposite that for four-quarters the economy has grown by 1.6 per cent over the year. That is called growth. In the same year Britain, the country those opposite have always tried to emulate, has contracted by 1.5 per cent. In the year to June Britain went backwards by 1.5 per cent, and the Australian economy grew over four-quarters by 1.6 per cent. But apparently the Opposition would like me to keep it a dark secret and not tell anybody. I am not going to comply with the Opposition's strategy of spreading the vicious gloom around the country that the place is somehow caught in some sort of low growth trap or recession trap from which it cannot emerge. That is not right. This country has emerged from it, and all of those things&mdash;such as productivity, lower interest rates, low inflation, a recovery in balance sheets and exports going gang busters&mdash;are there and are continuing to grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Argus has said that he is concerned about the economy overheating. So while the leader of the National Australia Bank says that the economy might overheat, the Leader of the Opposition says that it is doomed to a recession trap. Who would you rather rely upon for a view&mdash;on Mr Argus or on the Leader of the Opposition? I know that Dr Hewson will take Mr Argus's name. Dr Hewson draws up a list of Fightback's friends and foes. The Leader of the Opposition is a nasty fellow and is drawing up a list of high profile companies, community groups and individuals who support the coalition's policies. He is drawing up another list of those who are antagonistic towards them. In other words, God help poor Don Argus. If he happens to say something critical, he will go straight on the antagonist list. Presumably, if those opposite think they can peddle themselves into office, they would then take retribution against the people on the antagonist list. In some countries that is called corruption.

That provision of human services is overwhelmingly targeted towards those who are most in need. The paradox of the Opposition is that, essentially, while Opposition members come in here and weep crocodile tears over unemployment, they would not only pursue policies which would increase unemployment and reduce employment, but certainly also set out to attack those who are disadvantaged as a result of unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance today refers specifically to the failure of the Keating Government to recognise the continuing impact and pain of the recession on the Australian small business sector and the unemployed of Australia. This is responding to the unbelievable assertion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were out of the recession long ago.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to remind the House of a pledge which the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people on 19 December 1991, when he became Prime Minister after knifing his colleague the previous Prime Minister in the back in order to gain the job. The Prime Minister gave three pledges to the Australian people, saying that he wanted to make three commitments. The first was, `I pledge to give everything I have got to the job and to the country'. The second&mdash;I ask honourable members to listen to this&mdash;was to deal honestly with the people and to tell them the truth. This is a ripper. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I'll be resisting that temptation as much as it's humanly possible.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he will go halfway to telling the truth, but not all the way. He wanted an escape clause. He said, `I will try to tell the truth, if it is humanly possible'&mdash;this from a man that has not told the truth for a long time, a man that has misled the Australian people for one heck of a long time. He is still doing it with that ludicrous situation yesterday, when he said that we have been out of the recession for a long time. As I have said, he said, `I will be resisting the temptation as much as possible'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third commitment was, `I pledge to fight the battle against unemployment and for economic recovery with all the energy I can muster'. It is interesting to see, when we look further, the things he went on to say. I remind the House that on 6 March 1990 the Prime Minister, then the Treasurer, said, `There won't be a recession'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to what the Prime Minister said on 19 December: `I pledge to tell the truth'. Clearly, he did not tell the truth. He said, `There won't be a recession'. He did not tell the truth. On 22 March 1990 he said, `We won't let there be a recession'. He did not tell the truth. What was his pledge? His pledge was to be honest with the Australian people and to tell them the truth. On 30 November 1990 he described Australia's recession, the worst recession in 60 years, as `the recession that we had to have'. That is not the truth, because we did not have to have the recession. We have got the recession `that we had to have' because of his incompetence. He was incompetent because he could not read the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Prime Minister described, in May 1990, the technical definitions of a recession as nonsense. He is right. He waited until there were business failures, high unemployment and people trying to sell their assets in a falling market when they could not. He wanted something more than technical definitions when the Australian people were suffering&mdash;when they were burning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what has happened since he said there would not be a recession. This year alone there are 27,166 bankruptcies. When asked about the recession during his pledge to the Australian people he stated, `It is one statement I made as Treasurer that I regret'. There was no, `I'm sorry. I got it wrong'. In fact, he reminds me of Fonzie from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Happy Days</EMPHASIS> when he could not say, `I'm R-r-r-wrong'. This Prime Minister has been wrong for 10 years and we have paid the price. This Prime Minister has as much foresight as Mr Magoo; he cannot see very far in front of him. For 10 years he has been trying to plot the course for the Australian economy. He has got it wrong at every turn and we have paid the price. In addition, the one million unemployed have paid the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991 when the Prime Minister said, `I regret it'&mdash;and there was no, `I'm sorry. I got it wrong'&mdash;he went on to say, `The statement seemed to be too uncaring at the time'. He did not say that it was wrong or anything else; just that it was a bit uncaring. He was saying that politically he should not have said it: the Government was never after a recession; policy was only about a slowdown. In other words, it even got that wrong. The Government could not even get a slowdown; it blew the recession. In the statement he went on to say, `It was deeper than any of us would have ever wanted it to be, or needed it to be'. He said, `I can never consign Australians to the misery of unemployment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what has happened to unemployment. When the Prime Minister made that statement Australia's unemployment rate was running at 10.6 per cent, just on 900,000. In February, after he made the statement, it jumped to 11.5 per cent. It has been in the 11 per cent range ever since. The latest figure dipped down a touch, but we have still one million people unemployed. That masks the figure of those in training schemes and a whole range of other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the point that the Prime Minister made&mdash;that we have been out of recession for quite sometime now. In a study released yesterday&mdash;the day he made the statement&mdash;by the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the following question was asked in a survey of chief executives: `Do you believe the economy is unhealthy or very unhealthy?'. Of those surveyed 86 per cent said that the economy was unhealthy to very unhealthy. Yet the Prime Minister is trying to tell us that we have been out of recession for quite sometime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The survey asked about the prospects for economic growth under Hewson or Keating. The results showed that 30 per cent of respondents thought there were greater prospects for economic growth under Keating and 64 per cent thought there were greater prospects for economic growth under Hewson. Who do we reckon can do something about this economy? It is not the Prime Minister, who has not been telling the truth, but the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the coalition who at least have policies to take us out of this recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They went on to ask, `What do you expect in the future?'. For interest rates, 79 per cent expected an increase; for inflation, 68 per cent expected an increase; and for foreign debt, 71 per cent expected an increase. All these were expected to go up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer today went on to quote Don Argus of the National Bank. It is interesting. I too would like to quote from the National Bank's last survey contained in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Decisions</EMPHASIS> magazine. I might add that the person previous to Fels was, of course, the Treasurer. This was a survey of chief executive officers, and the caption leads in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, they want Canberra to lay down some clear strategy to move Australia out of the recession. A majority endorse the Opposition's GST, some labelling it as a "circuit breaker".</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, in the survey, 64 per cent of people believed that the introduction of a consumption tax would have a positive impact on the economy. Let us look at the questions that were asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is the Australian economy moving out of recession?</PARA>
<PARA>Fifty-six per cent felt we were still in a recession. The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Has your business started to recover?</PARA>
<PARA>Fifty-seven per cent said no&mdash;no way in the world. To the question, `When do you expect it to turn around?', 75 per cent of the respondents said, `The first half of 1993' or beyond. That is not some time ago, but next year or in the future. The questions went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which of these best describes your company's employment situation?</PARA>
<PARA>We have been told that we have job growth. Seventy-one per cent were cutting back on staff&mdash;still cutting back on staff. As I mentioned, the respondents believe that we, not the Government, would turn this situation around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report was released yesterday in the building and construction sector. Non-residential building is 40 per cent down. Even in the factories and shops sector there has been a drop of 30 per cent. Further decreases are likely in 1992-93. Activities in these categories are sensitive to domestic economic conditions and demand for the manufacturing sector has fallen sharply. The area of shops is expected to fall by around 30 per cent, and approvals are to fall in the coming 12 months by 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the property sector. Of course, honourable members will remember from the last sitting period that in April 1989 the Government had a valuation of $28m for the Reserve Bank building in Perth. The same valuation in April 1992 was down to $14m. It fell by half. Property in the Sydney CBD likewise was sold at half its value. A building with a construction cost of $65m to $70m sold for $28m. So clearly capital investment has been falling. It has fallen 27 per cent in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is still very high and is not in fact showing any signs of falling substantially. People are being hidden in training schemes; people cannot get jobs; businesses are still going broke at record levels and, indeed, over the term of this Government, if we count personal bankruptcies and company insolvencies, we have had something like 100,000 failures. The Government has no policy to turn this around. There is no confidence out there in the market. </PARA>

I think it important to look at the credibility of the person who has been saying that we have been out of recession for quite some time; that we were out of recession long ago. Let us look at his credibility. That is what the Prime Minister said yesterday&mdash;that we were out of recession long ago. It is all a case of credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we believe someone who got it consistently wrong? One million people unemployed, record bankruptcies, lack of confidence, falling sales, falling markets, a collapse in the property market, a collapse in values&mdash;they are all genuine signs, to use the Prime Minister's own words, of recession. With high unemployment, business failures, people trying to sell assets, assets at half their value by the Government'a own valuation, it is a true recession under the Prime Minister's own definition. He does not worry about technical definitions. As he quite rightly said, he is trying to hang his hat on the fact we have a technical turnaround. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us go back to the Prime Minister's pledge to the Australian people. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is I pledge to give everything I have got to the job and the country.</PARA>
<PARA>Where has he been for the last 10 years&mdash;particularly the last 6 to 12 months&mdash;when Australians have been on the streets? It is all right for the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to say what has been happening in the United Kingdom. He ought to drive around the streets of Australian capital cities at night and look at the kids who are sleeping on our streets. He should look at the people who do not have homes and the people who cannot get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least we are offering the Australian people the opportunity to get a job and to get some dignity. What about all of the kids who have finished their schooling and want to get a job? They do not want more training or more schemes. If we look at the history of Labor governments we can remember the RED scheme&mdash;that was Whitlam's scheme&mdash;and the CEP scheme. Every time they could not find something for someone to do they said, `Let's put them into a scheme'. We now have the current scheme to hide the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at the pledges&mdash;the solemn promises to the Australian people. The Prime Minister's second pledge is `to deal honestly with the people, to tell them the truth'. I ask honourable members: did the Prime Minister tell the Australian people the truth yesterday when he said that we have been out of recession for a long time&mdash;`long ago' was the term he used? Did he tell the Australian people the truth? Did he deal honestly with the one million unemployed? I do not think he told the  truth.  He  was  clearly wrong.  I  remind the House that in his second pledge he continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tough times, of course, the temptation is always to gild the lily. I will be resisting that temptation as much as is humanly possible.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister is really saying, `If it suits me not to tell the truth, I will not tell the truth'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third commitment is I pledge to fight the battle against unemployment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He did not tell the truth. Unemployment has gone through the roof since he made that pledge. Why should we or any Australian believe anything this Prime Minister says? He is incompetent; if he were a company director he would be sacked and drummed out. He has ruined the economy of this country. He has a lot to answer for with regard to the one million unemployed people and the record bankruptcies&mdash;100,000 and rising. But, more importantly, he did not tell the truth. Why should we believe him now? We are not out of the recession. The Prime Minister has not kept his pledge to the Australian people and it is time that the Australian people had a crack at getting rid of him. </PARA>

When the shadow Minister was quoting from the survey of Certified Practising Accountants, he should have quoted another part of that survey which is very clearly and deliberately aimed at small business. The survey is mentioned in an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. The article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

I thought he would actually mention those, but he did not seem to. As I said to the shadow Minister during Question Time, when he asked a question preliminary to his matter of public importance, what we really should be looking at is what is happening to employment growth in the small business sector. The number of wage and salary earners in small business increased by 3.8 per cent over the period April 1991 to December 1991&mdash;that is, 60,000 new jobs. This figure does not include self-employment, which rose by 5.6 per cent or 43,000 jobs in the first six months of 1992 compared with the same period in 1991. Small business is now generating the job growth that Australia needs. I think it is the duty of any shadow Minister to acknowledge that fact and not go on saying the recession is still on. We are out of the recession. It is a period of slow growth, and small business is now in a period of employing staff again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The shadow Minister just does not understand anything. If he wants to have a look at the figures, he should have a look at the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication which shows clearly that small business is now employing more people. Small business was the first to feel the pain of the recession, and it is now the first to feel the benefits of recovery. It is a simple analogy. It happens time and time again in our economy. Hopefully we can alleviate much of that pain in future times. In fact, the whole problem that the Opposition has is that it does not have a policy. An article in October of 1990 states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Where is the policy? There is no policy for small business. The Opposition meets with people and says, `Look, it is all the big picture'. It does not worry about small business. The Liberal-National Party does not even have a commitment to have a Minister responsible for small business. It will not commit itself to saying the shadow Minister actually will be the Minister for small business. It will not commit itself to anything. It does not understand the needs and aspirations of the small business community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that in Question Time the honourable member asked me a question about the electorate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time I have left I would like to address a few areas where the Government has been helping out in the small business sector, particularly those areas of growth. One of those great areas of growth in the last few years has been franchising. The contribution of franchising to our economy is not greatly understood. Franchising is a highly successful vehicle for business to establish growth, particularly for those entering business for the first time. Franchising in this country has a turnover of over $32 billion. It accounts for 25 per cent of all retail sales in Australia. Importantly, franchising has grown, even during the recession that we had, at 12 per cent per annum. It is one of the great growth areas. Why is it so important? Because franchising in this country employs 175,000 people. Over the last two years, as I said, franchise outlets had a growth rate of some 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many areas, franchising offers the opportunity for those people who have had the most difficult time&mdash;that is, the youth of our country&mdash;because franchising by and large employs young people and gives them experience. The Government itself is strongly committed to this sector because of the growth it has shown in establishing new businesses, enabling businesses to be well run and enabling businesses to actually prosper. The problem we have had, of course&mdash;and anyone who has watched programs such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investigators</EMPHASIS> would be aware of this&mdash;is that because this particular form of small business is very successful it has some very poor imitators; unethical practices have led to a copying of the format. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Government was approached by the sector and took up the challenge of finding a proper solution to the problems facing the franchising sector. We set up a franchising task force, which was charged with reporting back to me in a period of 12 months. It was made up not of so-called experts but of four franchisors, four franchisees and people from the sector who service franchising. It produced a report within the time frame required and the Government has now accepted the fundamentals of that report. For a two-year period we will have a self-regulation code established in Australia, and all State governments have agreed not to introduce any prescriptive franchising regulation during that period. If that is not effective, then obviously other measures will have to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is providing seed funding for the code of practice as recommended by the Franchising Administration Council, which will move to full self-funding from fee income over two years. The code of practice will provide cooling off periods, improved dispute resolution and more equitable contract conditions. Banks and other lending institutions will be signatories to the code. Franchisers which comply with the code tend to be more successful and are better lending risks. In fact, the franchising area is a clear example of where this Government is prepared to work in partnership with business, to listen to the small business community's problems and to act cooperatively with small business in solving them&mdash;unlike the coalition, which does not believe in any policy at all for the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister referred today to Australia's extraordinary surges in manufactured exports. In fact, the small business community is playing an important role. I refer the shadow Minister to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> dated 2 October. The article is entitled `The new heroes who make and export'. They are small, they make things and they are winning markets overseas. It is actually a good example of what is happening out in the small business sector. The lead-in to this particular story reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An extraordinary increase in manufactured exports is being driven by a growing band of aggressive small businesses that fervently believe the world needs their high-quality specialist products.</PARA>
<PARA>What has happened for small businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, as this Government has made this economy internationally competitive? They are now finding that they can compete not only here, against imported products, but worldwide. We are seeing extraordinary growth in the export sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises, of course, that small and medium enterprise has that vital role in expanding Australia's export performance. As we are all aware, and should be aware, manufactured exports now outweigh primary industry exports. This is a significant change in the basis of our economy. It is due in some part to the fact that we have had a recessed primary sector, and that is of concern to all of us. In fact, we are exporting some 22 per cent of our GDP, which is higher than the level in Japan. That is something that we should not forget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia too often undersells itself. We talk about ASEAN and the growth economies associated with ASEAN. Australia's GDP is bigger than that of all the ASEAN countries combined. We are the thirteenth biggest economy in the world. We are not a small player. Our small and medium sized sector is a vital part of that vastly improving economy. We are becoming a further processor of our mineral wealth. We are becoming a supplier of ETMs&mdash;elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;to our Asian neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently led a construction mission to parts of South East Asia, and many of Australia's best construction companies are now participating in the growth of South East Asia, exporting Australia's expertise and exporting Australia's services.

What is needed in this country is what this Government has provided.

It is of particular importance that we focus on the small business performance over the term of this recovery. This recovery will be brought about by the small business sector much more strongly than by the large business sector. The figures I quoted earlier gave a clear indication of the growth that is taking place in the small business employment area at the same time as many of our large corporations are still shedding staff. It is small business, as is the case throughout the world, that takes up the challenge and employs more people. This is not unique to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home State of Victoria we saw something of that last Saturday. The figures are well known, but I want to pick up on two things on which people are yet to comment, one anecdotal and one factual, that reflect the magnitude of the problem we face after a decade of failure of political will and leadership. The area in Victoria that had the largest swings were in an arc across the north-eastern and eastern suburbs of Melbourne. State seats such as Eltham, Warrandyte and Wantirna all had swings of 14 per cent and over, which was almost unprecedented. That part of Melbourne has a very high proportion of 15- to 24-year-olds. The Federal seat of Menzies in that area has one of highest proportions of any seat in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not so much that young people turned their backs on Labor. What happened was that their parents did. Time and time again the word came back from our Party workers that the feeling in the electorate was, `I thought it was hard in my day, but it is nothing like what my kids are facing'. That is the second point. The kids are facing it, and on polling day all across the eastern suburbs of Melbourne what people working on the booths experienced was something unique. The 18- to 20-year-olds, who have known only the Labor Party in power at a State and Federal level, all of them voting for the first time, would walk straight past all the Party workers of all political parties without taking anything. So disillusioned were they with what a decade of Labor had done that they were opting out. They were showing what farce compulsory voting is and they would compulsorily turn up at the polling booth but not take any interest in the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an isolated experience; it happened right across electorates. It is not surprising, because in Victoria 42 per cent of those 15- to 19-year-olds who want a job cannot find one. Joan Kirner took the rap. The legacy she copped was 42 per cent unemployment, and the man who created it, the Prime Minister, sits over there. The situation in Victoria would be acceptable if it were short term pain for long term gain, but it is not. In my State, the pain has manifested itself as long term unemployment, crime, suicide and alienation&mdash;all of which can be directly traced back to the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to talk about each of these in turn. The level of unemployment that young people are facing is unique. At the national level, youth unemployment is 34 per cent. It is 42 per cent in my home State, and it is something that we have not experienced before. Even in the depths of the Great Depression, the level of youth unemployment and the level of adult unemployment were almost identical: they were 20.8 per cent. Sixty years later, adult unemployment is at 10.9 per cent and youth unemployment is at 34 per cent. This time young people are being hit three to four times harder, and it understates the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of youth unemployment does not take into account those people who have stayed on at school or higher education unwillingly because of lack of any other opportunities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the Australian labour market augurs poorly for those already disadvantaged in the labour force, of which there are, and continue to be, very many. Our estimates and projections imply strongly the number of long term employed will be, by a large margin, at unprecedented and still growing levels over the next two years. There is not, now, any chance of avoiding this.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about the potential for 500,000 long term unemployed well into the 1990s. They are not my figures; they are those of Professor Judith Sloan from Flinders University. In the last recession the number of long term unemployed peaked at 190,000. Today the number of long term unemployed has not yet peaked, but it is already over 300,000. The extra number of long term unemployed just in the last two years is nearly equal to the number of long term unemployed 10 years ago. Back in June, the Victorian Chief Commissioner of Police, Kel Glare, who is noted for his impartiality, said publicly that he feared the young long term unemployed would be unemployable and a disenfranchised underclass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past 10 years the number of break-ins in Victoria has gone up by 50 per cent, which is 930 a day; serious assaults have gone up by 140 per cent; stealing has gone up by 69 per cent; and fraud has gone up by 110 per cent. Using statistical data from courts, it can be seen that violent youth crime, youth gang activities and female crime have all increased. Australia has a high rate of the reporting of crime by victims compared with other countries, yet any statistics are incredibly hard to come by. The ABS has a crimes unit which has been functioning for two years, but it has put out nothing. It still cannot agree about definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply not an area where the Government has no role. The Government can set standards; it can set examples; it can try model approaches; it can evaluate; it can disseminate; it can initiate; and, above all, it can lead. It has done none of that. These problems are realised by our current Prime Minister who said in this House in 1980:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If honourable members opposite think the Baader-Meinhof groups and the urban guerillas in Western Europe will not be a feature of Australia, as we move through the 1980s, with high levels of unemployment in the cities, I think they may be disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA>When he made that statement, long term unemployment was around 60,000. Today it is well over 300,000, with 181,000 people being added to the long term unemployed just in the past two years. That is 181,000 dead men around the neck of Australia's own version of the Baader-Meinhof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suicide, particularly amongst young people, is a national tragedy.

When one looks at the circumstances that young people face today, one can only expect this to increase further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack), who held the shadow youth affairs portfolio for many years, wrote privately to successive Ministers responsible for youth affairs. With no fuss, he offered a bipartisan approach on the issue of youth suicide. The majority of his letters were not even answered. The simple fact is that this is an area where the Federal Government has to show some leadership. We have seen none to date. To not be alarmed by the high and increasing level of youth suicide in Australia is to ignore one of the biggest problems that young people face today. This Government has made no attempt to protect Australia's vulnerable children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of youth homelessness, groups such as the Salvation Army and the Sydney City Mission are seeing unprecedented demands for services. The Sydney City Mission estimates that every night there are 10,000 kids on the streets and that 10 per cent might be hardcore homeless youth. We have no real figures on this. We simply do not know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat in this House during Question Time and listened to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his shrill, hysterical and histrionic manner talk of Britain's pain, homelessness, a tent city and the pain of its recession. I have travelled extensively throughout the First and Second Worlds and I have never seen the pain and suffering overseas that I have seen in the past two years as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When unemployment in Australia goes from 6 to 11 per cent, unemployment in the Aboriginal community goes from 30 per cent to 55 per cent. When the Government stops uranium mining for political reasons, the Koongara Aborigines are in the dirt. When the Government fails to see that the money gets down to the person who needs it, leprosy, diabetes and syphilis are rife. When the mining industry winds back, Aborigines all across the Top End are in the dirt. That is the legacy of the recession we had to have from the Prime Minister we did not have to have and do not have to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset this matter of public importance had a focus on small business, but it has moved significantly from that point. There are a few things that it is important to state about the nation as things stand, about the state of the economy and about the Government's drive to create the economic growth that is crucial to providing jobs and opportunities for all the different groups that we have heard the Opposition talk about today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the most important things to make clear at the outset is that most of the initiatives the Government has taken, designed to ease people&mdash;be they amongst the Aboriginal community or other communities&mdash;through the most difficult parts of the impact of the recession, have been to give them a sense of justice and security because of the range of measures that we have put in place in those areas, be they in health care, educational opportunities or training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) said, `We can't measure all these things by money'. If he looks at the need for health care and for opportunities amongst the Aboriginal community, he will see that it is pretty clear that unless the Government plays some role in helping to encourage that to happen, it just will not occur. The proposals in Fightback to massively cut back the expenditure on Aboriginal affairs prompt the question: what sort of sincerity goes with the comments that were made earlier in this matter of public importance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the broader issues of the economy. Both the Opposition speakers on this matter of public importance spent a lot of time saying how bad things were and how much the Government was to blame for what had happened. Each of the initiatives the Government has taken&mdash;be it in the One Nation statement, the youth jobs summit, the Budget, or the cuts in interest rates and the provision of opportunities to people&mdash;has been denigrated each time an Opposition member has spoken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time there has been a cut in interest rates since February 1990, the Opposition has said, `You're pushing the pace too far. You're going to create all sorts of consequences. You'll have to re-adjust policy. You'll have to re-apply the brakes on interest rates and monetary policy because you're forcing the pace of change too quickly'. Each time, that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has really happened is that the Government has recognised the need to make sensitive adjustments in monetary policy and sensible adjustments in fiscal policy to help to create the development of growth. We have had four quarters of growth. It galls the Opposition to have it stated and restated that we have 1.6 per cent growth. It would much rather there be negative growth through the period leading up to the next election. But that will not be the case&mdash;and it is not the case now&mdash;because we have adapted policy as the occasion has demanded. There is no doubt that we have had that level of growth over the last four quarters. No-one can dispute those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also clear&mdash;and I am justified in pointing it out&mdash;is that the impact on employment, the reduction in the level of unemployment is, as always in these matters, one of the last things that flows through into the figures. That is a matter of concern to us all. Opposition members should not come in here and say, `You're responsible and we are going to hold you to account and play on the misery of people who suicide'. I think that is an unfortunate way to approach public debate about these issues. I think it is far better to say, `What can we do to assist'&mdash;be it small business, which this MPI was supposed to be about, or other sectors of the economy&mdash;`to help create that growth?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken a range of initiatives over the last 12 months, particularly in small business. For instance, we have had changes to taxation and capital gains tax. Goodwill exemptions for small business were changed in the One Nation statement. Marginal tax cut reductions are planned to take effect from 1 July 1994. There have been changes in depreciation allowances and changes in the provisional tax arrangements that affect small business. These are all relevant factors for small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the alternative that the Opposition wants to impose on small business? It is the goods and services tax&mdash;the panacea for all the problems of small business and the unemployed that the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and the honourable member for Chisholm talked about. What would be the impact of the GST on small business?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6T4">Mr ELLIOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It floods them with paperwork, as the honourable member for Dobell points out. Small businesses would become branches of the Tax Office. They would spend most of their time being collectors of tax. The 800,000 small businesses would become branches of the Tax Office. The GST actually means more business taxation for small businesses. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would take away part of the comparative advantages that many small businesses have now because they are not affected by the threshold levels for payroll tax and so on. It would also take away some of the other incentives that they have. It is clear that once there is some growth in the economy, as the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, pointed out in his contribution, the first group that is able to take advantage of that and gear up quickly to meet that increased demand is small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very thing the Opposition would do by imposing another major business tax on business is stifle that activity and growth. As soon as the Opposition does things to create additional inflationary pressures and additional interest rate pressures&mdash;and that is exactly what the goods and services tax does&mdash;the people who are most inclined to show caution and not to take the decisions to invest and increase investment opportunities are small business, because they are the ones who are most caught up in it. They do not have the benefits of the other changes that the Opposition purports to provide in Fightback. They have not gained from those sorts of things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition would ensure that every small business&mdash;be it a fast food outlet, a hotel, a restaurant, a hairdresser, a dry cleaner, a butcher, a nursery, a motor vehicle repairer, a newsagent or a cinema&mdash;will be subject to the 15 per cent GST. Most of them are not caught up in the other forms of taxation that apply. The net effect of all of those changes, as people in a lot of industries are starting to realise, is that the goods and services tax has a devastating effect on those sections of small business. We do not have to look much further than one of our growth industries, one of our successful industries&mdash;the tourism industry&mdash;to see the concerns about the goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), is at the table. It might be worth while trying to establish exactly what the Opposition's policy is in relation to the goods and services tax on tourism. We are getting some pretty conflicting signals from the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and from the shadow Minister at the table about how they are going to deal with the tourism industry. They know that many of the small operators in tourism are not affected by the other sorts of taxation but, my goodness, they are affected by a 15 per cent tax that goes on to every hotel bed, every restaurant meal and every other service that tourism operators provide throughout Australia. The effect on those industries will again be devastating. All of those small businesses not only become branches of the Australian Taxation Office but are devastated because of a taxation regime which has taken no regard of their capacity to contribute to the economy, their capacity to grow and their capacity to make a contribution to economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be far more useful to create a situation in which we encouraged every one of those small tourism businesses, be they in restaurants, or be they the operators of hotels and motels up and down the east coast of Australia and all over the rest of Australia, to take on more employment. That is a useful thing to be doing. There is nothing in Fightback that provides any incentive to do that. If we look at not only the micro effects of the goods and services tax on those operators but also the macro effects of the GST or the Fightback package as a whole, we see that basically the Opposition is saying that the very things that are done by government to encourage those industries are not essential; they are superfluous to the real needs of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of our tourism industry, export enhancement schemes, export access development schemes for small business&mdash;the Opposition does not think any of those things really matter. It thinks that every small business can automatically access its own world market for its products. It thinks that industries can create opportunities just because Fightback has been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not mind taking Opposition members to a couple of the small electrical firms in my electorate which have developed and expanded their business only because there were industry development arrangements, industry plans in the telecommunications and other industries which encouraged their operations. That is the sort of arrangement that is needed between government and small business to encourage growth. The Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs is quite correct: establishing a dialogue, a meaningful forum whereby small business and government can interact on policy to get policy development and constructive growth for those industries is vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the Minister has achieved in his role as Minister for Small Business. That has been the Government's objective. That is how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has approached the important area of small business, and that is why the encouragement of small business, rather than throttling it as the Opposition proposes to do with its GST, is the best way of creating employment. The sort of phoney tears that we have been getting in this MPI debate do not recognise the real needs of people in small business in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992, which is now before the House, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Many of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. I will briefly outline the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of this Bill contain consequential amendments to section 26 of the principal Act resulting from changes in schedules 7 and 8 to this Bill. Section 26 allows consumer price index adjustments to be applied to beer, certain spirituous liquors and tobacco and petroleum products. Schedule 1 to the Bill is operative from the first of January 1988 and contains amendments to correct anomalies which were created upon Australia's accession to the harmonised tariff. It provides a free rate of duty for aquarium aerators, transmission shafts and cranks for outboard motors and master recording blanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2 corrects an anomaly caused by the implementation of the concessional tariff provisions of the Florence agreement on 1 July 1991. This change provides a free rate of duty for instructional books for certain games. Schedule 3 is operative from 7 May 1992 and reduces the customs duty on aviation gasoline by 1c per litre. The decrease in duty begins the phasing out of the collection of that part of the duty on aviation gasoline attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 4 is operative from 1 July 1992. It contains changes to schedules 3 and 5 to the principal Act to put in place Government initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers. The changes remove quota restrictions from certain parts of footwear and introduce a new 10 per cent duty for the subject goods. These changes are accompanied by the accelerated phasing out of preference for goods from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This schedule also contains the extension of quota restrictions on certain types of cheese. Administrative changes have been made to the duty free importation of pick-ups and utilities of 30 years or more of age and to components for passenger motor vehicles. Government initiatives to assist food packaging and food processing industries are also contained in schedule 4. These changes will provide new duty-free concessions to allow processors to import the latest overseas technology for use in these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 5, which is operative from 19 August 1992, increases the duty on certain tobacco products by $5.00 per kilogram, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech. The duty on aviation gasoline is further reduced by 1.1c per litre. This results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in Civil Aviation Authority costs of providing rescue and fire fighting services at airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced by the Government in March last year, quota arrangements for textile, clothing and footwear goods will be abolished from 1 March 1993. Schedule 6 contains a series of amendments to give effect to this policy. Goods previously subject to quota will be subject to ad valorem rates of duty. Concessional treatment of industrial crafts will also be abolished from 1 March next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New concessional item 61 is inserted in schedule 4 to the principal Act to give effect to the Government's overseas assembly provisions scheme. This scheme will allow designated manufacturers to export Australian made textile parts and to re-import the exported parts duty free in made-up articles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 7 is operative from 1 July 1993. It redefines the rate of duty applicable to certain spirituous liquors of chapter 22 from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan Province. The customs component of duty on imported beer is to be removed in schedule 8 to this Bill. In future imported beer will attract the same rate of duty as does locally brewed beer. This change will operate from 14 days after this Bill receives royal assent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the question of primary industry in Australia and particularly the importance of primary industry in agricultural field days. At this very moment in my electorate there is very strong support for a field day at Elmore, a small township north of Bendigo. Elmore runs one of the most widely recognised field days in Australia. At its opening day yesterday 12,500 people were in attendance. The field day runs for three days. They are expecting in excess of 50,000 people in attendance over the two following days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This field day has been running for many years. It not only plays a very important part in the life of people in Elmore but it also provides a very wide range of services for a whole host of people who are involved in primary industry. They take the trouble to attract a great number of exhibitors. In fact, this year 550 exhibitors were attracted to that field day with a wide range of products and primary industry services which they make available to farmers throughout the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farming community, of course, has had a very difficult period over the last three years and in some areas even longer than that. Fortunately, there have been good seasonal rains in my part of Victoria. At one stage it looked as though they may have had too much rain during September with record rains. I am pleased to say it looks as though it could be a reasonably good season for grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress the importance of these field days in the whole of the Australian primary industry sector and this is just one example. Exhibitions at the Elmore field day provide a preview of new designs and techniques for rural properties. In fact, everything for the people on the land is offered at these field days. Taking technology into the farm homes other exhibitors gave a new look at alternative electricity supplies, lighting and water supplies. There were a whole range of community services exhibitions which service rural communities and farm areas. All in all, these field days play a particularly important part in the furtherance of the primary industry sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address one particular aspect of primary production in Australia as it affects Australia's export markets and that is the need for the production of clean, good quality food from this country. We are probably one of the leaders throughout the world in producing relatively clean, good food. I take the opportunity to commend the Government for taking some action to further the production of clean food in Australia. If we are ever to achieve some further major export markets overseas we need to be concentrating on producing a clean, top quality product at a low price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there is tremendous emphasis on Australia looking at markets in the Asian regions for its food products. I agree that there are markets to be obtained and we do need to devote a lot of attention to that South East Asian area which has some very large populations which need the type of quality of food that Australia can produce. As I said earlier, the products must be of good quality and clean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we must not forget the European markets to which we have been supplying food for a long period. After recent experiences in Europe with areas which are affected by acid rain, herbicides, and chemicals we see that these all affect the quality of the food throughout Europe. Certainly the products are not of a standard which Australia can produce. In Australia we are in a very rare position to capitalise on the quality of our food still going into the European markets. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We already do substantial trade with many European countries. We enjoy a very healthy balance of trade with the Netherlands which takes a lot of our product as well as with many other areas throughout Europe where some of the farm practices with their overexcessive use of chemicals and herbicides have affected the quality of their product. I can assure the House that the quality of Australian products overseas is well enjoyed by the people who are in a position to receive them, particularly in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much that we can do in our marketing of these products. The marketing side of it is the area to which we need to direct our attention rather than looking at some of the trade negotiations which need to be carried out at the same time. There is no doubt that the Uruguay Round of negotiations under GATT needs to be finalised as quickly as possible. I believe that what we should be doing is directing our marketing approach to the consumers and the consumer organiations. Many consumers throughout Europe are not aware that Australia produces some of the best quality and cleanest food products in the world. There is a tremendous opportunity there for us to direct our political attention not only to the bureaucrats and the politicians in these countries but also to the consumer organisations and to the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the consumer organisations throughout Europe are aware of the quality and range of products that Australia can offer.

There is no doubt that New Zealand has conducted a very vigorous marketing campaign. Who else could change a Chinese gooseberry into a kiwi fruit and market it throughout the world? The New Zealanders are taking the game away from us. We need to start implementing the measures in the Fightback package which will help to ensure that the rural community and primary industries can keep on producing a low cost product for world markets&mdash;a product that is free from chemicals, that is of top quality and that will enable us to compete against the New Zealanders and ensure that we have a big slice of that European market.

But we need to do something about our marketing strategy. It needs to be directed more at the retail level, at the consumers themselves. We need to demonstrate to them that we can supply the products that they need, and at the right price and of the top quality that they require. I am sure that there are many lessons to be learned from the exercise of the Shepparton Preserving Co. which has already made significant changes in its industrial relations situation which has enabled it to compete overseas and to re-establish many of the markets that it lost to other countries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is impossible to discuss primary industries without discussing the ramifications of extreme drought, so chronic is the situation in western Queensland and New South Wales. Last week, accompanied by the shadow Minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), I visited some of the worst affected drought areas in this nation. The effect on families, businesses and on the local community of that drought was devastating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a property west of Charleville we stood on parched earth that only 2 1/2 years ago, in the worst flooding in over 100 years, was covered in 18 inches of water. Today it resembles little more than a moonscape. The property would normally run between 8,000 and 10,000 sheep, which would provide the necessary income to service the debts and for the farmer and grazier, in this case, to raise his family. Today only 250 sheep battle to survive on the 30,000-acre property. During the floods of 1990 the grazier watched helplessly as more than 1,200 sheep drowned as they were swept away by the floodwaters. In the past 12 months a further 4,000 sheep fell victim to the drought, despite the drought feeding program of the grazier. The property now runs 250 sheep, one horse and two cows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case that I refer to. The average debt in the south-west and central western Queensland region is estimated to be $350,000 per property. That figure is supported by the rural counsellors in the central and south-western parts of Queensland. Graziers in the drought areas in the Charleville region face debts in excess of $500,000 to $700,000. The rural counsellors told me that a total of 40 to 50 per cent of properties are not considered viable. Naturally enough, this devastation is reflected in the local community. Charleville, the service town for the region, has experienced a 3.5 per cent growth in unemployment in the town and region over the last month. The domino effect of this worsening situation is indisputable. These figures demonstrate that one just cannot rely on national figures to paint an accurate picture of some parts of Australia. It is quite inappropriate to look at the effects just on an Australia-wide basis rather than on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extreme drought has become the final straw that is breaking the backs of hundreds of farming families. Progressive Labor Government policy has put farmers in this situation. Farmers have battled against high interest rates and an inflated Australian dollar. The Government gutted the income equalisation deposit scheme which enabled farmers and graziers to put money aside in the good times for times of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse still, severe drought was removed from the natural disaster relief arrangements. While this Government refuses to recognise extreme drought as a natural disaster, I note in Budget Paper No. 4 that natural disasters continue to include floods, storms, cyclones, bushfires and earthquakes. The 1991-92 Budget Papers show that $13m was spent on earthquakes. Surely when these phenomena in the weather are considered regular occurrences, and when one can insure against loss of property as a result of cyclones, storms, floods or bushfires but one cannot insure against drought, we should once again recognise extreme drought under the natural disaster relief arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lethal cocktail mix of Government policy brought farmers and small businesses to the very brink, and the drought has pushed them over. The only Government reaction to the devastation facing rural Australia has been a display of ignorance, a lack of compassion and inappropriate policy announcements. I put this down to inexperience and a genuine lack of knowledge of the needs of the rural sector. We have witnessed the failure of one Government policy after another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute failure of the Government's scheme to allow farmers to access unemployment benefit immediately comes to mind. Now, in the time of most desperate need, the Government releases its hard line farm adjustment measures which can result only in pushing more farmers and graziers over the edge. Eliminating farmers appears to be the clear objective of this Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's so-called readjustment grant is totally inadequate and leaves farmers homeless and unprepared to exit the industry. The Minister is offering farmers $45,000, subject to an assets test, in return for the sale of their family farms. The average age of an Australian farmer is 57. In most circumstances the farmer knows no other trade. A $45,000 grant will not put a roof over the heads of a farming family. It will not guarantee a farmer any future. However, it does guarantee the farmer a place on the unemployment queues of this nation. Under this Government the guarantee for a farmer is of a place a long way down the unemployment queue. With one million fellow Australians out of work, a 57-year-old farmer must bide his time until he reaches the pension age. This is a very miserable existence for a generation that has given so much to the Australian nation&mdash;and the agricultural sector still provides 30 per cent of our export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is completely ludicrous when we consider the redundancy packages for senior public servants and waterside workers. Public Service departmental secretaries who lose their jobs are entitled to five years paid leave at an annual salary level of $99,000 plus benefits, with the compliments of the Government. Even if they take up work in the private sector, they continue to draw a salary from the Public Service. Wharfies walk away with an average redundancy package of $100,000, plus generous superannuation benefits and cash payments in lieu of annual sick leave and long service leave. The farmer made redundant through a poisonous mix of this Government's policies and the effects of the extreme drought is forced to sell the family farm and home for a mere $45,000. Is this giving Australian farmers a fair go? I say that it is giving them no chance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's message to the farming community is to shape up or ship out. This comment is insulting and demonstrates just how out of touch he really is. For a member of a government which continues to ramble on about best international practice, he has got a lot to learn. Best international practice will never be achieved in this country until the snake oil men of the AWU in Queensland have been flushed out. Archaic industrial relations practices still exist in the latter years of the twentieth century. These practices prohibit shearers from working outside the hours of 7.30 to 5.30 Monday to Friday in the very region that I am talking about, the south-west Queensland shearing industry area. Absolutely no discretion is permitted. Even if the very lives of the sheep are in the balance, not to mention the livelihood of the graziers themselves, it is illegal to shear sheep on weekends in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland AWU officials claim that working outside these hours would cause anarchy. These sentiments are from a bygone era and have their genesis somewhere in Moscow; they certainly do not have any place here in this nation. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is in no position to call on primary producers to shape up or ship out. The Government's new rural adjustment arrangements have made no provision for those financially impoverished farmers wishing to remain on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a very large extent the Federal Government must take the blame for the situation facing much of western Queensland and New South Wales. An effective income equalisation deposit scheme would have assisted farmers to help themselves in periods of extreme drought. The recognition of severe drought as a natural disaster would have provided invaluable support to the rural sector. The Government's obsession with exchange rate manipulation and interest rate hikes has pushed the farmer to the very brink. From the brink, the Government offers no salvation&mdash;just a gentle but firm push. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In these estimates of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, I want to deal particularly with the national scandal that is the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. AQIS takes up some $183m of the Primary Industries estimates, around 40 per cent of the total. Indeed, the only item that is bigger in the Primary Industries estimates is the line for administration, and that really does say something about a department, that it spends more on administration than anything else. Nonetheless, the charging of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has been a matter of great controversy amongst exporters, particularly primary industry exporters, over recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is moving towards 100 per cent cost recovery of AQIS costs. That is a principle that is widely in vogue in Australia at the present time but, where industries have to wear full cost recovery, it is surely reasonable that they should have some say, some input, into what those costs actually are, rather than have some remote government bureaucracy establishing whatever fees it likes and imposing those on the industry. Last June or July the Minister boasted about the economies that have been achieved within AQIS, and then he turned around and announced increases in all the charges. So, in spite of whatever economies may have been achieved, there are continuing increases in AQIS costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the controversy has centred on the meat industry. Indeed, the $147m cost of Australia's meat industry inspection system is a national disgrace. I am advised that last year, in a New Zealand meatworks, it cost $2.29 per head to inspect 84,000 head of cattle with six meat inspectors. At a similar works in Australia, it cost $8.70 per head to process 84,000 a year with 10 inspectors. It was more than three times as costly as in New Zealand to do the same job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1991, Australia had 1,654 meat inspectors, of whom only 1,249 were directly employed in inspection at any one time. There were always 405 inspectors not engaged in inspection. Even at that time AQIS acknowledged that 87 inspectors were deemed surplus to requirements and a further 155 were estimated to become surplus within the next two years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GT4">Mr TRUSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We still have to pay for them. There are 63 meat inspectors stationed in towns where the abattoirs have closed, and 45 of those inspectors have refused transfers. That is perhaps not surprising: if one can live in a town where there is no work to do, why should one bother to accept a transfer? With these sorts of overheads it is little wonder that, even though meat inspectors receive a salary of about $32,000, AQIS charges them out to abattoirs at about $70,000 an inspector. The high level of overhead cost is clearly unacceptable and must obviously be reformed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a new range of increases in charges. Small slaughtering establishments, from 1 August this year, will have increases from $96.60 to $322 per day for their meat inspection services. I do not think there are too many employers who would be keen to pay $322 for the services of one person for a day's inspection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just in the meat industry where these scandals proliferate. The export fishery industry is another which is drawing to the attention of the community the enormous cost increases that were imposed on that industry, including a new export quality charge which it has to pay. What the Government fails to realise is that not all of our fishing exports are live crayfish or abalone, or other high-priced exports. The majority are low-priced lines. One developing industry, for example, is the export of squid tentacles. I am told that it is now costing 2.29 per cent of the total value of the export of these commodities just to provide the export inspection services. There is no incentive for any industry to try to expand its markets when our inspection services are so costly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sydney Fisheries has recently provided me with an example: the export of a sample carton of 10 kilograms of redfish which it needed to send overseas. The total value of this 10-kilogram carton was $25.25. The AQIS charges for the inspection were $125. So it cost $125 to inspect an export shipment valued at $25. How on earth can we ever develop new markets when these disincentives are imposed by this agency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the fruit industry, the charges have increased from $18 to $43 per quarter-hour. What a charging rate&mdash;$18 to $43 per quarter-hour. That means that inspectors in the fruit industry are charged out at $745 per day. It is not hard work. All they need to use is their eyes but they are charged out at $745 per day. The Government loads these costs on, yet talks about the need to encourage an export culture in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer especially to the scandal of the grain industry inspection charges. They were increased by 19 per cent for field inspections and 138 per cent for in-office inspections. The executive director of the Queensland Produce Seed and Grain Merchants Association, Mr Tony Parsons, described this as `economic lunacy'. Merchants say that the increases in grain inspection charges will mean that the cost of inspection of sunflowers and safflower will be as high as $12 a tonne, and of smaller seeds, up to $20 a tonne. To put that in perspective, it is something close to 8 to 10 per cent of the total value of those commodities wasted in inspection services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is in the bulk commodity area where perhaps the highest and most exorbitant charges occur. There is a standard rate of 38c a tonne for the inspection of bulk grain. That means that for a 60,000-tonne shipment of grain the total inspection charges will be around $23,000 for the ship. A modern ship-loader is capable of loading commonly around 2,000 tonnes per hour. That means AQIS collects $836 per hour for its services in inspecting the loading of that ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a larger ship-loader such as Kwinana in Western Australia, which loads 5,000 tonnes per hour, the cost of the inspection charges is $1,900 per hour. This is not difficult work. One has to sit in an air-conditioned room. The samples are taken automatically by a machine&mdash;provided by the growers, I might add. All they have to do is open their eyelids. This opening of eyelids is so difficult that AQIS normally has two or three people on hand to watch what is going on and, if it cannot get the people, it just recruits them as casuals. Virtually no training is involved. It is a simple matter of looking out for weevils or prohibited weeds and for this it charges up to $2,000 per hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something has to be done about this kind of thing. The grain handlers are moving towards developing a system which will presumably result in reduced costs. There is the development of quality assurance schemes, in cooperation with AQIS, so that these industries undertake their own inspection. They are preparing massive manuals in the hope that AQIS staff can be removed from their operation altogether. Hopefully, that will result in reduced fees, although as yet there is no clear commitment that that will actually happen. The grain industry is hopeful that, as a result of developing its own quality assurance programs, there will be significant reductions in the amounts charged by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter from one of the meatworks in my electorate that has gone through all the trouble of developing a quality assurance program. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we submitted to AQIS a Quality Assurance Programme to avoid the employment of an additional veterinarian this was rejected and we have subsequently been burdened with a further charge of approximately $2,500 weekly for a casual, relatively inexperienced veterinarian to do little more than be present. </PARA>
<PARA>In some industries the quality assurance programs have been developed but AQIS is still imposing its rigorous inspection regimes and outrageous charges on the industry. Exports are vital to the future progress of our country and it is essential that our export inspection services be charged at reasonable rates so that industries are not discouraged from developing new export markets. Encouragement and incentive ought to be provided to those brave and willing enough to explore the difficult export markets. We should be encouraging these people. AQIS should be providing assistance rather than imposing enormous charges to discourage those who do make the effort to export. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As I have said many times in this place, I represent one of the most magnificent electorates in the world, the Blue Mountains&mdash;not to mention the magnificence of the Rhine of Australia, otherwise known as the Hawkesbury.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Chairman, you are probably well aware of the fact that one of the major radiata pine board industries and timber industries in Australia is on the Oberon plateau, which is part of the Macquarie electorate. The industries that are being developed there by private enterprise are such that that is a booming town. It is one of the highest and most elevated towns in Australia&mdash;it is over 4,000 feet above sea level. The industry, the energy of the people and the foresight of the shire council are such that industry is attracted there in a significant way. I am talking about hundreds of millions of dollars worth of investments. Even though the current unemployment rate is in excess of 10 per cent, it is around 6 per cent in Oberon. It is a boom town and that is due in no small way to the efforts being put in by local government in the area, with a considerable amount of assistance from the State Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I am also a representative of the magnificence of the Hawkesbury. This area is a significant producer of primary industry products. There are many market gardens in the area. There is a beautifully set out mosaic of farms on the lowlands surrounding the Hawkesbury River and it is quite extensive in the Windsor area. In the early days of our history the area was referred to as the food bowl of the colony, as indeed it was. It continues to be an area that provides a vast amount of market garden produce for people in the Sydney area and indeed in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other industries that people with great initiative are developing. For example, we have some Korean farmers in the area who provide most of the Korean vegetables for the Korean population of this country. Recently they discovered a very lucrative market, yet one that takes a lot of hard work, in Korea. They export Australian bees to begin the spring season over there. As honourable members know, it is a very bleak and cold winter. To start off the season and to really capitalise on the full productivity of spring blossoms in Korea&mdash;as it takes quite a while to develop the bee industry each year&mdash;they have developed a program of exporting packs of bees. Each pack contains about 1 1/2 kilograms of bees. The Korean farmers and other bee farmers in the Hawkesbury are establishing a very interesting and profitable market in this export oriented area. That is something that we very much need in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great concerns of the University of Western Sydney, the Hawkesbury Campus, in cooperation with a very significant industry in the Hawkesbury&mdash;Memtec Ltd&mdash;involves the problem being experienced by the pollution of the river. One may recall the big thing that the media made of the blue algae blooms that occur in the Hawkesbury from time to time. Even though these scare campaigns are somewhat exaggerated, it is very important that the Government take on board the fact that we have an industry such as Memtec in the Hawkesbury that has spent millions and millions of dollars developing systems whereby the run-offs from sewerage systems&mdash;from streets, farms and so on&mdash;can be actually put through filter systems that remove all the solids and hence are able to put a purer run-off fluid into the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great risk at the moment that the Memtec factory, which has one of the world's most innovative filtration systems, will have to take its business offshore. I have brought up this matter before in the House, and I have mentioned it to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. I hope that Commonwealth and State governments will make more use of the filtration systems available from Memtec, and that greater use will be made of them in purification programs before any run-off water goes into the river, particularly the Hawkesbury. As I said earlier, the Hawkesbury is really the Rhine of Australia. It is one of the most beautiful rivers one could see anywhere in the world, yet we have major problems keeping the river in a condition that will limit the incidence of algae and other problems that beset the river. </PARA>

I was amazed to be shown the full details of a new method of shearing, if it can be so called. The CSIRO has developed a new technique whereby a small amount of harmless chemical is injected into the sheep about six weeks prior to the time when it would normally be shorn. At the same time the sheep is put through a machine that automatically puts a net over it, and six weeks later the net is unclipped and taken off and the whole fleece comes off intact, leaving a growth of wool on the sheep as well. </PARA>

In fact, many of these people have actually seen their cash incomes reduced by 50 per cent or more.

In 1981 there were 2.2 million, and now in 1992 some five million people receive entitlements. Social security and welfare expenditure currently accounts for more than $35 billion or 34.4 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays for 1991-92. In 1992-93, $37 billion will be spent, constituting 34.5 per cent of Commonwealth outlays; while the Department is dealing with 2.2 million pensioners, 900,000 beneficiaries and two million family payment recipients. </PARA>

Recent studies have confirmed that this number will be very high well into the 1990s. In August there were 352,000 long term unemployed, or 40 per cent of all unemployed people. Judith Sloan and Mark Wooden predict that the number of long term unemployed will reach 400,000 by the end of 1993 and this will decline at a very slow rate once the economy improves. Merle Mitchell, the President of ACOSS, only this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> made the point that, in her opinion, the number of long term unemployed could reach half a million by the end of the recession. She also estimates that one in eight Australians are now living in poverty. Today on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether or not we are technically out of the recession is really irrelevant. The pain is far from over.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday we sat in this chamber and heard the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which demonstrate once again that he is trying to confuse the Australian electorate into believing that by bombastic, irrational and inaccurate statements he can change the tide of history. Both Sloan and Wooden have pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first positive growth in employment since 1990 was recorded in the July 1992 figures, though the level was not sufficient to offset labour force growth and hence bring about a reduction in the raw unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>They state that full time employment continues to decline and that the only improvement has been in part time employment, providing the impetus for growth in the July figures&mdash;a mere 1.6 per cent over the year to 30 June. They say, `Overall, it is clear that the labour market is in a sorry state'. Three per cent growth is not enough and even if we achieve this level the recession will be only technically at an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No government in Australia's history has been responsible for placing at least one million people in unemployment, and probably a further half million have been discouraged and dropped out or are chronically underemployed. The Opposition's Fightback proposals are not harsh because a firm commitment has been given that people will receive counselling and assistance immediately they apply for JSA&mdash;not left for six months as is currently the circumstance under Labor. Through our youth training wage, training voucher and Austrain programs, the unemployed will receive a much better opportunity to get back into the work force than is provided by current policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad, inevitable fact which the Minister is well aware of is this: under current arrangements, for every 10 jobs which become available, the long term unemployed are filling only two of them; the other eight are going to first job entries and young work seekers, as would normally be the case. We are also liberalising conditions for older workers accessing JSA. They will not be required to go through the onerous Job Search arrangements which are currently in place. Unlike Labor, we are encouraging people to take part time, temporary or casual work without losing access to JSA at the termination of their work. We see this as a fundamental requirement. The circumstances today&mdash;and they may well continue for much of this decade&mdash;are that while people may have access to the opportunity of some part time work, under current policy the prospect of them getting access to full time work will quite clearly be significantly less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in Question Time we heard the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) make a speech which disgusted many of us listening to him. He tried to compare Australian policy, and particularly that of the Opposition, with circumstances in the United Kingdom. What the Treasurer seems to forget is that in our own country Australians are also sleeping on the streets, in the gutters, under bridges and in car boots. But he sought to ignore all of that and simply believe, `That's a problem the British have and we have a pristine situation in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to make the point that the Salvation Army cares for 1,340 homeless people per night. It gives out 1,021 food vouchers and provides 5,432 meals per day. It had to close a hostel in Bendigo because it did not have enough money. From February to June this year, 10,000 people contacted the Brotherhood of St Laurence seeking clothing and furniture&mdash;twice as many as had to appeal to them in the last year. The Salvation Army said that Sydney's inner city crisis centre had experienced a 100 per cent increase in numbers over the past year; while the Smith Family  announced a 35 per cent rise in the number of people seeking assistance. The Anglican Home Mission has exhausted its supplies of tinned food. St Vincent de Paul assisted three-quarters of a million people in 1991&mdash;a 27 per cent increase over 1990. The Wesley City Mission estimates that each night more than 10,000 children are homeless in the Sydney metropolitan area. Shame!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1992-93. I find it quite extraordinary that nowhere is the difference between Labor and the Opposition exemplified more than in the whole issue of social security and our attitudes to it. At the heart of Labor and Labor's philosophy is a belief in equality; but as well as that there is a belief in caring for those who are unable to care for themselves. That belief is reflected in the social security package and certainly in this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when we look at the issue of age pensions, we see the increase in the single pension, the extension of eligibility pensioner concessions to part pensioners, the question of the privately provided home equity conversion scheme and investments as well as a range of other things. I find it quite extraordinary that members of the Opposition decry the drop in interest rates. One wonders what they intend to say to those families and other people in our community who are purchasing homes and who have found themselves with an extra $200 to $300 a week in their pockets in disposable income as a result of the drop in interest rates on their mortgages. While we certainly acknowledge that the drop in interest rates has had some impact upon pensioners and pensioners' incomes, we believe that we are here as a Government to provide those kinds of safety nets. I think it would be fair to say that no-one in the world has the kind of pension system which Australia has and which our aged population so richly deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also extraordinary to hear the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) talk about the way in which social security offices operate and the kinds of operations which exist within them. As someone from the Ford electorate which has a couple of very busy social security offices, I have never found people to be less than helpful. Indeed, they have consistently focused on client services. The Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) will verify that on his visit to them any question of queues and other factors is in fact looked at and addressed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps an indication of the kind of community in which we live that an attempt by our local social security office to expand its operations in the Logan area into Browns Plains was in fact opposed by the local council under some spurious arguments about parking. One finds all of this quite extraordinary when on the one hand we hear people talking about service and service delivery and, on the other, when the Government, the Department and departmental officers attempt to do so they find themselves stymied by a local government that poses as independent but in fact one could say is certainly traditionally conservative. It is that kind of philosophy and that kind of worth which we as a Government put upon the value of social security and upon the value of individuals, and our belief as a Government is that we have a very important role to play in their support which very clearly differentiates us from our opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the honourable member for Bradfield also drew our attention to the unemployed. Like all of us in this chamber, everybody decries unemployment and indeed works actively to ensure that people have the kinds of opportunities which will give them jobs. For somebody whose electorate has a very low education base&mdash;it has been put as low as years 4 and 5&mdash;it really does not matter what the economy does in Australia in the 1990s. People who have a very minimal education need to have different kinds of opportunities if they are to enter the current labour market. So the establishment of the Logan TAFE by this Labor Government and the other labour market programs have provided opportunities for over 10,000 people to access for the first time in their family's life secondary and tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the nature of people who are unemployed, it is also a question of the kinds of opportunities which they have been unable to access over a longer period. If we look at the kinds of people who are traditionally longest unemployed, we find that by and large they are middle aged men. Indeed, those middle aged men grew up in the halcyon days of conservatively ruled Australia! One has to ask what kinds of opportunities they had for education that would enable them to take themselves into the twentieth century. </PARA>

As well as that, we also recognise that as we have an ageing population social security has a very real role to play. We have also seen some crocodile tears, I guess, about people living in poverty and the kind of society in which we live. I indicate to honourable members that figures done by the Department of Finance when looking at the impact of the GST yet again paint a very clear picture of the kind of society in which people would live. Indeed, those people who are well enough off to own their own cars will in fact find themselves 6 per cent better off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the estimates for the Department of Social Security I want to point out that there are a number of fundamental issues that we, as a nation, need to constantly review and examine. During the twentieth century, governments have provided income support for the aged, the invalid, supporting parents, the sick, the unemployed, students and children in families in a way that has put enormous and growing burdens on taxpayers. This support is focused very much on State based delivery systems. Our approach has failed to specify what is expected of those who are capable of self-reliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have assumed that retirement incomes and other income support methods which can be supplied in the market should be treated as public goods rather than private goods. We have penalised those who have striven for self-reliance by maintaining their tax burden at levels which cross-subsidise those people with similar or higher incomes who decide to leave it to the Government. We have imposed income tax in a manner which ignores many of the factors that take account of the taxpayer's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might wonder why I raise the issue of the taxpayer's capacity to pay. I want to put the view that we should have much closer integration between the tax system and the social security system. Indeed, with modern technology a powerful argument can be advanced that accounting activities of the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office, in respect of individuals, should be put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In putting them together, we also need to be innovative and sensitive to the needs of individuals. My needs today may be very great in relation to the support I may require from a government instrumentality or a government program, but tomorrow I may have no needs at all. As for next year, I may be quite secure and fully self-reliant. What I am advocating is that we should expand what is happening gradually, without people really understanding that it is happening. We should be accounting for individuals in the tax system and in the security system on the basis of lifetime, life cycle accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done it for farmers and others in the tax system who have been able to average their incomes over a period of years. Due to flood, drought and the vicissitudes of the farming industry, it is appropriate that their incomes be averaged for tax purposes. One could well argue in today's economic climate that we should apply the same thing to a lot of people working or not working in other industries and allow them to average their income over a five-year period and be taxed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have begun to look at life cycle accounting in another area. We have the so-called graduate tax, to which has now been added the graduate supplement, which is a loan scheme which the Government has introduced. So we say to a student, `We understand that when you do your studies you, at government expense, the expense of taxpayers, are adding to your skills and gaining an income earning capacity that you would not have but for that public expenditure. When you do get a higher income, we expect you to pay back the cost of that educational investment in you'. I think that whole concept could be further expanded to enable people to more conveniently adjust their financial affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may think I have just chosen one example of what the Government has done. Yesterday I spoke in greater detail about the Fightback proposals with regard to superannuation entitlements. We are in effect saying that if people invest savings for retirement to become self-reliant we will give them the equivalent of the capital value of the pension through tax rebates to supplement those savings. So we are moving very close to a situation where it is a pension or a superannuation rebate equal to the capital value of the age pension. So we are recognising the life cycle needs of individuals. We are recognising that it takes time to make savings for retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could extend this whole concept right throughout the field of social security and social expenditure requirements. I have a view that people really want to be self-reliant. They want the Government to provide them with a framework in which they can take responsibility for themselves: their own income, their own health insurance and their own education expenses. So what we should do is put together the Social Security Department and the Tax Office to enable people to smooth out their income earning capacity and relate it more to their expenditure needs over a longer period than they will be earning that income for. I hope that the Tax Office and the Social Security Department are trying to blend together their different cultures and get some very real understanding of how people can be self-reliant and left with the income to honour their social expenditure responsibilities. I believe that people would undertake those responsibilities if they were given the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked to have developed that concept somewhat further, but time is limited. There is another matter about which I want to speak. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is the former Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, has just come into the chamber. In relation to social security payments, I want to touch on the need that many retirees have for what some people call basic banking. I have a view that it extends further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, every Australian citizen wants to have full access to the very sophisticated, innovative and exciting payment system that is developing in this country. I talk of the plastic card. Most people call it a credit card. In the report of the banking inquiry, we recommended that the banking industry should look to converting the plastic card by removing what we described as the plastic wall that now exists between the credit card and the debit card. In fact, it should be a transaction card, a multi-purpose card. People should be able to use it as a credit card if they wish; they should be able to use it as a debit card to draw off their ordinary bank accounts if they so desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technology in this country is in place, but we are not using it to the fullest. I wonder whether the Social Security Department is actively pursuing one of the recommendations of the Committee to examine how pensioners could be involved in this. It may well be that it would be economic for the Government to issue pensioners with a debit card, which would enable them to draw their pensions directly from the Department of Social Security instead of having to open a bank account. The Government should give them the choice. The Department could even pay them interest if they leave their money in their accounts. But the Government should give them the facility to hook into the electronic transaction system, and we should remove the barriers that now exist and prevent the multi-use of those cards. In that regard, the Commonwealth Government needs to talk very strongly with consumer affairs Ministers. We need to remove this separation between credit facilities and other debit and transaction facilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past nine years, one of the Government's finest achievements has been the reshaping of the social security system into one of the most efficient and effective systems in the world. The system is means tested to ensure assistance is targeted to those most in need and is funded from general revenue, unlike American or European systems, which are insurance based. Our system provides an important safety net to ensure that those in our community who are most in need can be assured of support. Australians know that this safety net is there to protect them, and they value its existence. They will not support those who seek to destroy it merely to satisfy an ideological obsession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance to families is one area in which the Government's commitment to people is demonstrated clearly. There are a range of payments and benefits available to working families to help them as they raise their families. About 3.7 million children in almost 1.9 million families benefit from family allowance payments. In addition, over one million of these children from families with low incomes receive the extra assistance provided by either the family allowance supplement or an additional pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government introduced the family allowance supplement in 1987. It provides further income support to lower income working families who are not otherwise in receipt of social security payments but who have children to support. The great benefit of the family allowance supplement is its simplicity. It is made as a combined payment with family allowance and is not taxable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Budget provides for a number of changes to family allowance and family allowance supplement which will result in a fairer and even more flexible system for Australian families. From January 1993, those receiving family allowance will be able to seek a lump sum advance of half of their allowance paid for one child&mdash;that is, $136.50. The choice will exist for families to take an advance every six months and receive the balance of their payment every fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As anyone with a family would know, expenses do not flow evenly across the year. There are times, such as the beginning of the school year, when some extra money for school shoes, books and so on might be necessary. The introduction of the lump sum advance means a much greater degree of flexibility for those receiving family allowance. The advance is designed to help families with medium sized expenses at a particularly difficult time of the year or to offer assistance for an unforseen expense. Families will be able to determine for themselves when and if the lump sum advance is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further assist families, the Government has also decided to use the consumer price index instead of average weekly earnings to index the parent income threshold of the family allowance supplement. While that may sound simply like a technical issue, it will undoubtedly be of benefit to many families. Unlike the average weekly earnings figure, the CPI is available for the financial year for which eligibility for the family allowance supplement is agreed upon. This means a more up-to-date figure and one that corresponds to the one used to index other family and welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disadvantaged groups in Australia today is sole parent families. The Government is committed to improving the status of these families within the community. Over 80,000 sole parents have participated in the Government's jobs, education and training program, or JET, since its introduction in 1989. The aim of JET is to assist sole parents to become independent of the social security system and obtain stable employment. It gives them skills, training and job experience to assist them to enter the work force on a permanent basis. It is an active policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">JET funding is increased in the Budget by $3m for 1992-93 and will be increased by $5m for each of the next two years. This further emphasises the Government's commitment to all families. This additional funding for JET will allow the program to extend services in areas in which demand for JET is growing quickly. Of particular benefit to sole parent families in my own electorate will be the additional JET funds available for people of non-English speaking backgrounds, who face extra barriers when attempting to participate in employment, education and training. Additional funds announced in the Budget will assist in the targeting of particular ethnic community groups and improvement of access to English language training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligibility for JET will be extended to two of the most disadvantaged groups in the community&mdash;sole parents receiving special benefit and recipients of the widow B pension. This move addresses equity concerns about JET and ultimately will reduce long term dependence on a multitude of other payments. The initiatives announced in the Budget build upon and extend the social security system that the Government has been setting in place over the last nine years. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his speech to ACOSS, said that one of the satisfying things about governing `is that you get to build on the blocks that you have laid'. FAS and the social security area was one of the areas he was speaking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to contrast the Government's commitment to Australian families through social security with the Opposition's proposal to destroy our safety net. The Opposition proposes to drastically reduce the upper income limit for family allowance for a family with one child to $55,000. About 90 per cent of families with children are now eligible for family allowance. The Opposition's move to reduce the income limit will reduce that figure to about 75 per cent, depriving the allowance to over 100,000 families. This, coupled with its 15 per cent goods and services tax on such things as food and child-care, would make life more difficult for many Australian families with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition also has a shock in store for sole parent families. As the Minister for Family Support (Mr Simmons) said in Question Time today, the Opposition wants to stop the sole parents pension when the youngest child turns 12 years old. This proposal would effectively cut 30,000 people off the benefit. What of the plight of those on Job Search allowance? Remember, the Opposition wants to cut that allowance after nine months. The tremendous difference between the Government and the Opposition is again exemplified when one looks at the social security portfolio and, in particular, the assistance provided to families. Unlike the Opposition's proposals to disrupt the lives of disadvantaged families, the Government's commitment to Australian families with children can in no way be questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that this Budget preserves and extends the important gains that have been made in support of families. It is important also to reflect that sometimes those gains have been made through Budgets that have been very difficult. The work the Labor governments have done through such things as the Social Security Review has borne fruit and put in place a system that now reacts and responds to the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, as I said when talking about the JET policy, it is a policy that aims to have an active society&mdash;not a society based on people depending upon handouts, but a society in which we try to assist those who are disadvantaged to help themselves to move out of the plight they are involved in. That can be no more clearly seen than by studying what has happened in the JET program over the short time that it has been in existence. I think it is important that that is a policy that involves not only social security but a range of departments. It is clear that we cannot address the income support of those people without addressing their needs in employment, education and training and addressing their needs for support, such as child-care, as they re-enter training and then re-enter the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, it is a clear illustration of the differences between the commitment of this Government to see that it is involved in encouraging and enabling people to get involved, in the wider sense, in the community and the Opposition's policies, which indicate that it would move away and allow some form of market forces to dictate what might happen over a great range of policy issues. </PARA>

The Australian Property Group outlaid $23m in the last financial year, well above this year's Budget allocation of $9.897m.

I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) on 30 July 1992 in regard to this matter, expressing my concern that the Government, rather than winding up its business concerns, was further going into business, purchasing an air-conditioning company that trades in the commercial air-conditioning area and even provides and installs air conditioning systems in private homes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even so, approximately 50% of Asset Services' income in 1991-92 was from untied sources. Asset Services has to compete with the private sector for this Government work.</PARA>
<PARA>It did not give it the licence to then charge off and start to go into business in a fully blown manner. Surely that indicates that the Department has learned nothing from what happened in Victoria and what happened in my State with WA Inc. and the enormous losses resulting from government wanting to go into business, particularly in the property sector. The Minister went on to say that the purchase of Jaymel&mdash;</PARA>

Asset Services will service the contracts purchased in the liquidation sale under the trading name, `Jaymel Airconditioning', and it will market its services to existing and new clients.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite frankly, we should be winding up activities in this area. We should not be throwing taxpayers' money at expanding business operations. We should not be throwing taxpayers' money at increasing the business operations of Australian Construction Services more particularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate in the south-west of Western Australia Australian Construction Services is tendering now for road works and road construction.

I had hoped that the report would go on to say that the Government would be winding up its involvement in business operations, not expanding them. It should not be expanding them in the construction area; it should not be expanding them by purchasing companies from liquidators, by going into the home air-conditioning business, or by putting around brochures touting its business for home maintenance and home improvements&mdash;brochures which say that it has carpenters, plumbers, electricians, painters and a whole range of other people simply to allow the Commonwealth Government to try to do that sort of work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the estimates of the Department of Health, I want to draw particular attention to a disease which has received some attention in recent times but not nearly enough. I say at the outset that I have a particular interest in this disease as my youngest son suffers from it. I refer to a disease which has become known as chronic fatigue syndrome. It has various names. It is also named myalgic encephalomyelitis, post-viral fatigue syndrome and chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. It is a condition characterised by the subjective complaint of extreme fatigue, exacerbated by minimal physical activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fatigue is associated with an inability to perform tasks that were previously undertaken with ease, and is accompanied by a combination of other symptoms, including difficulties with concentration and memory, myalgia, headaches and depression. I am told that the majority of cases appear to occur sporadically in the community following an acute infection which delineates what the scientists call a `healthy pre-morbid status' from the subsequent ill health and disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing awareness of CFS, or ME as some others refer to it, within the community, but for many years it has not been effectively diagnosed. This is simply because it is almost impossible to have one simple test to diagnose it. From my enunciation of the symptoms, people present as suffering from some viral illness or from a continuing flu-like sickness. When the normal tests are done on people nothing turns up as being unusual&mdash;but the condition persists for weeks, months and years. In some cases it goes on for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no known cause for CFS at this stage and no known cure. When one mentions the disease it is amazing how many people say, `Yes, I know somebody who has got that'; `A relative of mine has got that'; or `You should see so and so'. The cures range from herbal remedies right through every facet of both the formal and informal health fields. It is a very debilitating disease because, dependent upon the severity, it may range from a situation where sufferers may literally not be able to get up in the morning, or may not be able to open their eyes, to the extent where they can get up and have a shower but then have to go back to bed or where they are absolutely exhausted after walking up a small row of steps or crossing the street. The severity of conditions ranges from that to less severe problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diagnosis of CFS has been particularised in Australia and Australian methods are now being used worldwide. However, it is not a new disease. In the 1950s it was noted in Great Britain and it may have been present  many years ago. Due to the difficulty of diagnosis up to this stage, it has not been taken seriously by many medicos throughout the health systems not only here in Australia but right around the world. Only very recently has it been recognised as an identifiable disease with real effects and not something which is in the mind of the sufferer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may have heard of it under the title of yuppie flu. It was at one stage seen to be very much associated with young, upwardly mobile professional types. It seemed to affect young women from 25 years onward. More women are affected than men, but recently we have had an increasing incidence of the disease amongst younger people. My son is just 17 at this stage and he has had it for a year and a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring this matter to the attention of the House tonight because this disease is far more widespread than was previously thought. The introduction to a study by Andrew Lloyd and Howard Pender, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Economic Impact of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite a growing awareness of CFS in both the medical and wider communities, there has until recently been no epidemiological study of the prevalence of the disorder, and consequently no data has been available on the financial burden imposed by CFS on the individual, and on the available health resources. A population-based survey of the prevalence of CFS was completed in 1989, on the 114,000 inhabitants of the Richmond Valley, New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>The study found that on a conservative Australian estimate the prevalence rate is around 39.6 cases of CFS per 100,000 of population. That is a whole lot more than people believed to be the case in the past. The abstract to the study states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic impact of chronic fatigue syndrome on the individual, the government and the community was studied by calculating the direct and indirect costs arising from the disorder.  Data regarding utilisation of health resources, income and employment was obtained by questionnaire from cases of CFS identified&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as I have already mentioned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the Richmond Valley, New South Wales. In addition, aggregate Medicare data on the incidence and fees charged for each Schedule item for these cases was obtained.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the part that I want to bring home to the chamber this evening:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conservative estimate of the Australia-wide costs of CFS, based on the prevalence derived from the Richmond Valley of 0.4 cases per 1,000, was $28 million per annum to the Australian government and $65 million per annum to the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The abstract concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CFS contributes a large but neglected area of health resource utilisation and economic burden in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The aspect I want to bring home to the House tonight is not only the prevalence of it, which is much greater than was otherwise thought; not only that Australians are at the world forefront in identifying the disease and have developed the criteria for diagnosis; but also that very little, if any, research money has been made available to those studying the disease within Australia. It is that issue that I want to bring home to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and to the chamber tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a disease which is far more prevalent than was otherwise thought. Many people who have suffered from it and who are suffering from it have been dismissed in the past as having some psychological problem. The effect of that on their well-being can only be imagined. To be told that `It is all in the mind', `There is nothing really wrong with you at all', `Forget about it' and `Go and think positively' when they have extreme difficulty coping with the symptoms that I have outlined really has had a massive impact upon the sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have a much more sympathetic approach to research. It is obviously an immunosystem problem. It has been described to me as the reverse of AIDS. We all know that the immune system with AIDS breaks down completely. It appears that with CFS, rather than breaking down, the immune system is constantly in action. This gives the flu-like symptoms that one experiences when one's immune system is combating a viral infection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously of great economic significance because it costs the Australian community $65m per year, according to this study. It is time that some research money was made available from the NHMRC to do something about it. There are some very good researchers in Australia who have knowledge and capacity in this area. I would urge the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and the Government to give the matter the closest attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to spend some time discussing the Government's housing policy because it is what I call a sophisticated policy which is meant to ensure that all people in the housing market, no matter where they are or what their capacity, have the opportunity to get access to decent and affordable housing. It is that sophisticated response that has enabled us to build a program of such comprehension that it will take about 10 minutes to work through how it is we do this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing is one of the largest programs that the Commonwealth has. In round terms the Commonwealth is now devoting almost $10 billion through the Commonwealth-State housing agreement to make sure that there is public housing built in this country or that there is rental assistance housing, or through working with the housing industry to ensure that the cost and supply of housing problems are also well addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just break that housing market into its various sections. There are those in the private purchase market who do not require government assistance. Housing affordability, which is now a regular published measurement, is the best it has been since 1986. Since 1986 housing has never been more affordable in this country. The obvious reason for this is that interest rates for home mortgages are now extremely low. The 90 per cent of people in the work force who are working are on a good wicket at the moment. Because interest rates have dropped they can choose either to pay off their mortgage more quickly&mdash;as many people are choosing to do&mdash;or use the cash for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category of people comprises those in the private rental market who are unassisted&mdash;often young people who are saving to buy a home or for whom renting is a preferred form of accommodation. As we move through, we get more towards those people who do require and will continue to require government assistance. I am referring here to those in the private rental market who require assistance; their income is of such a level that they cannot possibly find accommodation that they can afford, so government programs need to be tailored towards those people. We have a very large government program of assistance for people in the rental market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third category of housing is straight public housing. State and Commonwealth governments agree to build houses for individuals who cannot otherwise afford to buy a house or who may choose to rent a public house at full rental, although by and large that is unusual. We usually allow State and Territory housing commissions to build those houses for Australians using mostly Commonwealth money. That is another very large area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a program which we have developed since 1984 which really sits between the public housing and the private housing sectors, and I want to draw attention to this as we work through our categories of housing types in Australia. The social housing program, which was once called the shared home ownership scheme, is our attempt&mdash;and a very good one&mdash;to take people from a rental situation into home ownership. Where they do not have enough money for a full deposit or to raise the capital to become 100 per cent home owners we, if you like, lever them into a situation where they can get the benefits of home ownership&mdash;that sense of stability and ownership that comes with a mortgage. So the shared home ownership scheme, which we now call the social housing program and which we boosted significantly in the Budget that we are debating today, offers that link between two forms of housing, ensuring that thousands of Australians can make the jump into a situation where they own or part own their houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is the private home ownership sector, the public and private rental sector and the purely public built rental sector. Then, of course, there is the very important area in which the Government has to play a great role and that is in emergency housing. We have two important Government programs in this area, the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program. The crisis accommodation program makes sure that there is capital funding so that houses can be purchased for emergency purposes. For instance, women with young kids who are under duress at home, young kids who are homeless, older men or women, or whoever, cannot simply be put into a refuge. They also need all sorts of assistance, counselling and whatever. We make sure that hand in hand with the crisis accommodation program there is a supported accommodation assistance program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the example of an individual&mdash;say, a woman&mdash;who on a Monday is living in fairly salubrious circumstances, with a nice house which is paid for, a couple of cars in the garage, et cetera, and then runs into domestic problems and on the Tuesday is thrown out or has to leave because she is being beaten up. One can recognise that, if that woman had no other form of support or family around her, she would be thrown almost to the wolves, except that the Commonwealth Government is able to provide assistance. So on night one of this terrible trauma she at least would be able to get to a women's refuge or shelter, perhaps with her children, and provide some sort of stability which is very necessary in those early days of need when she has had to get out of a relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From then on she might work through the system. She might move on to a crisis accommodation house to enable her to get a bit more support. She might be in that house alone or with a small number of other women. From then on, as her domestic situation works its way through, she might choose to go into rental accommodation with some assistance from the Commonwealth, or to go into public rental housing. After that, she might become more settled, move into the work force or whatever and then have another choice of moving on into a shared home ownership situation, into a cooperative situation or into a full-blown mortgage private home ownership situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The example of that woman illustrates the sophistication of the Commonwealth's housing program because we do not see all people as either wanting or being able simply to walk into the private mortgage market. It does not suit everyone's needs, and it does not certainly suit everyone's needs at all times during their lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to focus my comments tonight on the health area and in particular the appropriations that come under the heading of `AIDS Control', which are found on page 3.78 of Budget Paper No. 1. In this paragraph details are given of grants provided for education and prevention, treatment and support services, a national media campaign and research activities. Expenditure for these areas in the 1992-93 year is estimated at $51.8m. On page 164 of Budget Paper No. 3, under the heading of `Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', objectives are given which relate to that broad area. Although all of the objectives impact upon AIDS control, it is the fourth objective that is most pertinent. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. reduce the impacts of communicable diseases in Australia, and to eliminate transmission of HIV and to reduce the personal and social impact of HIV infection.</PARA>
<PARA>These are indeed admirable objectives. If the transmission of HIV can be eliminated, the social impact of the HIV infection would be vastly reduced in the short term and overcome completely, hopefully, in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, my concern this evening is that the designers of the current AIDS education program do not appear to be taking these objectives seriously enough. This time last year I spoke on this same issue, informing the Committee of some alarming facts that threw considerable doubt on the effectiveness of our current program. In that speech I referred to some findings of Professor John Dwyer who is the Professor of Medicine and head of that department at the University of New South Wales and who is recognised around the world as one of the top five experts, from mainly a medical but also a research point of view, on the HIV and AIDS problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among his findings, Professor Dwyer found that many in the community were still not associating sexually transmitted diseases with any risk of HIV infection and that medical practitioners compound this misconception by failing to test for HIV when sexually transmitted diseases are identified in a patient. Professor Dwyer's findings were confirmed by a study conducted by Dr Gavin Hart, who had his paper on this very topic published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of points I would like to make that lead on from these findings. Firstly, I would like to see those drafting AIDS prevention programs and literature placing more emphasis on the need to test for HIV if other sexually transmitted diseases are identified subsequent to sexual contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to see more promotion of the hepatitis B danger in association with the HIV awareness programs. Hepatitis B can be just as fatal as AIDS and more people fall victim to this disease each year than HIV, yet the hepatitis factor does not appear to be well publicised at all. In 1992 there were 5,218 cases of hepatitis B reported nationally, compared with 1,309 reported cases of HIV for the 1991-92 year. The HIV, of course, is the infection that leads on to AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would like to see greater emphasis placed upon the importance of correct timing for HIV testing. Dr Basil Donovan, director of the Sydney Sexual Health Centre, pointed to this very problem late last year when he was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper as saying that people often get tested a week after they return from overseas, when one cannot detect the virus. As Dr Donovan says, we just do not know how many more men go positive after this initial premature test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, I would like to see greater emphasis placed on the abstinence factor rather than so-called safe sex. Abstinence is a very much neglected aspect of the whole fight against sexually transmitted diseases in this country and throughout the world. In his press release of 13 November last year, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) highlighted the fact that, by World Health Organisation predictions, as many as 40 million men, women and children could be infected with HIV by the turn of the century&mdash;40 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, he indicated that two million Australians travel overseas each year and that the Travel Safe campaign would ensure that travellers had the knowledge to protect themselves, their sexual partners and families when travelling, just as they should when they are at home. Therefore, if we are to prevent these grim predictions from becoming reality and ensure that our travellers do have the correct information at hand to protect themselves and their families, we need to be certain that our safe sex recommendations are indeed just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on this point that I have some very grave doubts. Apart from abstinence&mdash;which hardly ever gets a mention&mdash;the key to the safe sex recommendation in AIDS literature is the dependence on condoms. My doubts concerning the condom recommendations were raised upon reading a very well footnoted booklet published by a US based organisation called Focus on the Family, a well known international organisation headed up by Dr James Dobson. Dr Dobson has been one of the principal advisers on the family to at least the last two Presidents of the United States, so he does have a lot of credibility, particularly in the United States and certainly internationally. Some of his instruction videos on the family and various aspects of coping with life within a family and so on are in great demand in many places around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information that was put out by this group, Focus on the Family, is very interesting. The booklet is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quick Facts on Safe Sex</EMPHASIS> and it highlights some very interesting statistics based on documented studies. There is not much use quoting anything these days from an emotional point of view or a hearsay point of view, but here we have a document that has been well researched and quotes scientific evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the HIV virus is stated to be 450 times smaller than a human sperm. That means it is pretty small. Secondly, the smallest detectable hole in a condom is one micron. The HIV virus is one-tenth to one-third the size of that hole&mdash;a very important fact for all in this chamber to understand, from the point of view of the advice that we give to people and with regard to the kinds of promotions that we are supporting in this chamber. Thirdly, researchers studying surgical gloves made out of latex&mdash;the same material as in condoms but six times thicker&mdash;found channels of five microns that penetrated the entire thickness of the glove. We should remember that the HIV virus measures between 0.1 and 0.3 of one micron. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> reported that, among married couples using condoms, where one partner was HIV positive, 10 per cent of the healthy partners became infected within two years&mdash;proving the point very clearly. This information alone is enough to throw significant doubt on the wisdom of relying on condoms for safe sex practice. If these statistics can be supported by independent studies, the only option we have is to push the abstinence alternative. It hardly ever gets mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would, therefore, be sincerely grateful if the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services would note my concerns and look into these four areas I have mentioned, which are published by the US based organisation Focus on the Family.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The portfolio appropriations in Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 1992-93, totalling something like $3.5 billion, cover a wide range of policy areas. Quite coincidentally, I have decided tonight to talk on the same topic as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns): the policy area of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of imperatives which drive the Budget initiatives of this year in the housing area. There are the major changes in the structure of Australia's population, the so-called demographic imperative. If we look at what is happening in the changing demographics of Australia, we find that, by the year 2006, the income unit of two adults with dependent children will have fallen to around 20 per cent of income units. It is now 25 per cent. Almost 50 per cent of all income units will consist of single persons aged over 35 and couples aged over 35 without dependent children. At present, this is 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 60 per cent of women aged 15 or more expect to be in paid employment, compared with 40 per cent. Almost 40 per cent of the population will be over 45 years. It is now 31 per cent. The population aged over 65 will increase by 32 per cent from fewer than two million today, to over 2 1/2 million. These are the sorts of changes in Australia's demography that we have to plan for now. We cannot just rely on being able, when we get to that point, to put in place policies which address those types of demographic factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another imperative behind our housing policy is the social justice imperative. Shelter is basic, essential. It is something that we need to address; it is something that government should have firm ideas about. We need to provide more affordable and secure housing and we need to ensure that that housing is more appropriately located. Rather than continuing the present trend of having all the new housing on urban fringes and in non-suburban, country areas outside our main cities, we need to look at our present housing stock and the way that we can improve it. The other imperatives that drive the Budget initiatives are the micro-economic reform agenda and the increasing urgency of the pressures on the environment caused by our burgeoning cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the goals that we see in the Commonwealth Government's national housing policy? As my colleague the honourable member for Petrie indicated, the Government seeks to provide maximum opportunities for Australians to own their own homes or to benefit from the attributes of home ownership. Australia is a nation of home owners. The rate of home ownership is around 70 per cent, one of the highest in the world. It is something that, put simply, provides security of control and a place where people can say that they belong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underpinning the Government's policy there is also a conscious decision to provide housing in better locations&mdash;housing that is related in the wider sense to places of employment, transport and other essential services rather than, as we see again and again, on the outer urban fringe, in suburbs such as the ones that make up parts of my electorate where there are no services. All we have is the urban sprawl going over the next hill and having to wait for essential things such as schooling and medical facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Petrie also said, what we are looking to do is give wider housing choices&mdash;housing choices that are more applicable to a person's stage in life, that are more flexible. What we are also doing is stressing our commitment to public and community housing. Comparing the Government's attitude with that of the coalition, it is clear, like in other policy areas, that government sees itself as having a clear role&mdash;and this Government sees itself as having a clear role in housing policy&mdash;as against a coalition that sees itself withdrawing and trying to minimise its direct role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst this Government, under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, is going to put some $4 billion into public housing over the next four years, in Fightback there is the withdrawal of funds of something in the order of $1 billion, with State housing authorities being expected to sell housing stock and to then use those funds. Overall that has the effect of reducing the number of housing units available. As in other areas, it is an illustration of the coalition's picking up and adopting policies that have been tried and have failed elsewhere. This is a policy akin to the massive selling off of public housing by the Thatcher Government. Yet again it is a contrast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight mention has been made of the social housing subsidy program which will put in $48m over the next three years. It is designed to give people the choice of going into shared home ownership schemes. Simply put, it is a program whereby people can purchase part of a house more akin to what they need and more akin to their means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also contains the new community housing program. This program takes off where the local government community housing program finished. It widens the scope of those that can encourage community housing through local government and encourages community organisations and other such organisations to be involved. I am hopeful that as two municipalities in my electorate&mdash;the City of Whittlesea and the shire of Diamond Valley&mdash;have expressed interest, they will take up the opportunity that the community housing program gives them to be involved in the provision of housing stock. Local government is well placed to know the needs of its community and to know the shortfalls that are not being met. Therefore, as in other areas of policy, it can be a partner in the provision of essential services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another program that comprises part of the national housing policy is the rent assistance program. Over the next four years an additional $171.5m will be spent. This will assist pensioners and beneficiaries with rental costs in the private rental market. But at the same time the Government has expanded its national urban development program. Funding of about $25m will be provided over the next four years. This funding will bring together previous programs, such as Greenstreet, the housing industry development program, the local approvals review program, with a number of other new initiatives which again can involve local government and help it to facilitate and integrate its local area planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also provides for the bringing forward of the better cities program funds into 1992-93 and 1993-94 to accelerate those initiatives. Again this shows the contrast between this Government and the coalition. This Government believes that it has a role to be involved in the types of projects that will be put in place under the better cities program and that will demonstrate the benefits of the effective planning and cooperation that we will need to address some of the problems that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives are in stark contrast to the proposals in the Opposition's Fightback package. Rather than increasing the supply of affordable housing for low income earners, the Opposition is proposing to sell off public housing stock. The Opposition's policies lack any strategy for improving the efficiency of our cities. It thinks that market forces, yet again, will put things right. In my area, market forces have not put things right; there has been a need for guidance. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1992-93, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 12 June 1992. The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1991 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill amounts to $14,092m, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1992-93. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to requests from the States for greater certainty in funding levels for the purposes of planning their medium term Budget strategies, the Commonwealth agreed at the 1990 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. This commitment was subject to the qualification that Australia did not experience a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. The Commonwealth honoured that undertaking at the 1991 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting in respect of 1991-92, notwithstanding the sharp slowdown in economic activity and the consequent deterioration in its own budgetary position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heads of government meeting on 11 May 1992 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), Premiers and Chief Ministers outlined the medium term budgetary prospects facing their governments. In essence, the States indicated that they faced a period of budgetary difficulties, while the Commonwealth referred to its own constrained budgetary position and the need to ensure that the total public sector's call on resources remained sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, a working party of Treasury officers from the Commonwealth and the States was established to report on the medium term budgetary outlook for both the Commonwealth and the States. That report is to be available to assist in a consideration of possible longer term Commonwealth-State financial arrangements at the 1993 Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discussions at the 1992 Premiers Conference focused on financial arrangements for 1992-93 only. The Commonwealth reaffirmed the undertaking it made in 1990 to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. The Commonwealth also agreed to provide additional assistance on a one-off basis for 1992-93. The Commonwealth's initial offer was for $150m. However, it was decided that States would receive the higher of their share based on either the use of the Grants Commission's amended per capita relativities or on an equal per capita distribution. This raised the overall cost of the Commonwealth's offer to around $166m. This supplementary payment will not be reflected in the base level of funding for 1993-94 and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,795m in 1992-93. By far the larger part of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance&mdash;to the Northern Territory and Victoria&mdash;and continues the separate payment of `identified road funding' which was introduced for the first time in 1991-92 following the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference decision to untie local road funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance and identified road funding will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1993 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Premiers Conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of agreement between the States and Territories on the appropriate basis for distributing financial assistance grants, the States accepted the Commonwealth's compromise proposal whereby the base level of financial assistance grants will be distributed on the basis of the Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities. These relativities are in accordance with the terms of reference provided to the Commission in November 1991, and amended in line with supplementary calculations provided by the Commission in April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants. In respect of the additional $150m, as mentioned previously the States and Northern Territory will receive the higher of their share based on either the use of the Commission's 1992-93 relativities or an equal per capita distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1992-93. Similar special assistance has been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the States. While it is still the Commonwealth's intention to move the Northern Territory progressively to a financial basis comparable with the States, the base level of its special revenue assistance for 1992-93 has been held at $40m, the same level as in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision is also made this year for the payment of special revenue assistance of $139m to Victoria to compensate it for the loss of petroleum resource rent tax revenue following the Commonwealth's decision earlier this year not to share that revenue. This payment is made on the understanding that it will be absorbed into the financial assistance grants base for 1993-94. This gives effect to the Commonwealth's undertaking that the decision not to share PRRT revenue would not affect the total level of funding available to the States, while removing any link between the level of payments to the States and the Commonwealth's PRRT revenue. It will also ensure that the other States and Territories are unaffected financially by this decision in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8m for capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount as provided in 1991-92. No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory. However, provisions in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Budget I think in general terms is clearly dead in the water, and nowhere is this more true than in the health arena. One of the major problems facing the health industry and the health care sector at present is the problem of public hospital waiting lists, where people are waiting for up to two years to have such things as hip replacements or cataract removals. This Government has attempted to address this. What it has actually done, however, is a drop in the ocean. It has given a paltry $35m a year, ostensibly to try to fix up the waiting list problem, when, in fact, what is needed by any basic economics is something in the order of $250m to $300m. So we have $35m instead of $250m to $300m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pretend, as this Government is doing, that this will have any significant impact whatsoever upon the horrendous waiting lists in every State in Australia is a sad joke. What it will do, however, because of the initiatives to contract out public patients into private hospitals is to reduce even further the incentives for individuals to take out private health insurance, which means, of course, that they will be reliant upon the public system. The public system which is already overcrowded, which already has up to 100,000 on waiting lists, will become even more crowded and grind to a halt. It is a sad day because the people most affected by this are indeed those who are in lower income groups and the aged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget also announced what it described as bonus payments. Bonus payments basically try to make up some of the shortfall in funding to the States from this Federal Government. Just to get some idea of the problem, for New South Wales alone the calculations from the Minister for Health, Ron Phillips, are that it would need a minimum of $1.2 billion to catch up with the deficit which it has already incurred and an ongoing $370m per year simply to keep its head above water to cope with the extra burden of public patients that this Government has thrust upon the public system by moving them, both directly and indirectly, out of the private system by the disincentives to take out private insurance. That is what New South Wales needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the Government given? It has given in the order of $200m per annum to the whole of Australia&mdash;and one gets that only if one agrees to reduce one's private fund income; that is, the number of private patients. So it is very much a catch-22 situation. Many of the States will be insignificantly better off. The increase will be minimal. As honourable members are aware, most of the States are revolting against this particular proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to private health insurance, there is nothing in this Budget to encourage people to look after themselves, particularly those people in higher income groups who can afford to. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) claims from time to time that private health insurance is an abomination, that people should not be allowed to have it and that, if they have any sense, they will not want it. The facts are slightly different. A recent survey in the Minister's electorate of Batman showed that 75 per cent of his constituents wanted private health insurance and that 87 per cent would be more likely to take out private health insurance if they had incentives in the way of tax deductions. The support for tax deductions from both these areas was very clear and very strong. The Minister's colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), in a speech to this chamber only a week or two ago, indicated how important it was that the Minister set aside his ideology and look at sensible proposals to improve access to both public and private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the question of capital investment. According to the Minister, we would need something like $500m per annum to maintain, not even to improve, capital investments at appropriate levels. According to John Deeble, one of the original architects of Medicare, the figure needed was $712m per annum. The actual amount allocated in this Budget is an amazing $3m, not $500m or $712m. Clearly, at that level we will get planning and no more. There is no understanding of the vast needs of the public hospital system for re-equipping and restructuring. Many of our hospitals are under-equipped and using outdated equipment in appalling physical circumstances, which our patients should not be expected to tolerate. All this Government does is offer $3m. It is an appalling indictment of what this Government has done and it is a gross misunderstanding of what is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also increase the Medicare levy. It gets around the broken promise part by deferring this until after the election. So fortunately this will never happen. We have made a commitment that the levy will stay at 1.25 per cent and will eventually be rolled back into the tax scale, as it should be. Bob Hawke, who used to be Prime Minister, said that this would hit low income earners more than any other arrangements. On 29 August last year, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Mr Howe, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be inequitable to increase the compulsory contribution of working people to finance unnecessary services and services of marginal clinical value. This is crazy economics.</PARA>
<PARA>It is another somersault from the Government which is without any justification at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other points in the health financing arena which I need to address. One is the question of whether the coalition policy will be moving towards a US type system, as is often claimed by the Government and, indeed, as has been recently claimed again. Either the Minister does not understand the coalition health policy or he does not understand the American system. There are appalling flaws in the American system. Something like 40 million people are uninsured. Many people are refused treatment. Many face crippling bills. This is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has occurred, firstly, because there is no universal health cover. There is universal health cover in Australia, and we support this. This is one of the advantages of Medicare and one of the reasons we will maintain it, contrary to some of the fibs that have been told by some members of the Government. Secondly, we have community rating; Americans have risk rating. Risk rating means the older and sicker pay vastly more for their private health insurance cover. Community rating, which we have in Australia and which will be maintained under a coalition government, means that the old and sick do not pay more for their health insurance than the young and fit. There are also legislation requirements in all the different States of America which make the whole thing much more complex and expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why the American health system is vastly different from the Australian system. They are like chalk and cheese. There is no comparison between the two systems. However, the Government likes to start its scaremongering to frighten the people it is supposed to protect&mdash;that is, the elderly, the sick and the disadvantaged&mdash;into believing that something will happen to Medicare. Too right something will happen to Medicare. It will be strengthened and improved in the way in which every sensible commentator wants&mdash;indeed, in the way in which Keith Wilson, the Labor Minister for Health in Western Australia, indicates is necessary and, as I pointed out, in a way which the honourable member for Grey also supports. These are commonsense approaches which are vitally important in this health financing debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which has been raised and which the Government pretends to be addressing is the question of doctors' fees. It says, for example, that under us with gap insurance doctors' fees will rise significantly. The truth is that, as at present there is competition, there will be competition under us; as at present there is a Medicare schedule and an AMA schedule, there will be a Medicare schedule and an AMA schedule under us. Clearly, any doctor who charges over-the-top fees will find his patients migrating to a doctor who does not charge over-the-top fees. The availability of gap insurance will not change that one iota, as the Minister clearly understands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister complains from time to time about the large bills being faced in the USA system. He seems to ignore conveniently the fact that there are huge bills faced by Australians, which total some $650m each year. This means that Australians have to pay that out of their own pockets. Some of these are crippling. I have had bills for thousands of dollars shown to me by patients who clearly cannot afford that. This is because the Government, for ideological reasons, refuses to allow people to insure against higher medical bills. It forces them to pay out of their own pockets, which is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to significantly increase the amount of public hospital funding. Our policies, on conservative estimates, will put an extra half a billion dollars into public hospital funding, whereas what the Government is doing is a gesture as a result of increased taxation via the Medicare levy. The Minister complains that we are giving a subsidy to take out private health insurance of only up to $800 per pensioner couple. I point out that it is $800 more than the ALP offers. So this really is a case of the ALP getting its figures completely mixed up. It seems to forget that it is offering nothing but disincentives to private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government would do well to focus upon the widely recognised failings of the Medicare system rather than direct attention away by focussing on our system. It needs to make sure that drugs such as Sumatriptan and Neupogen are available so that patients can have access to cost effective and good drugs. It needs to make sure that it does not waste taxpayers' money on this campaign supposedly to explain Medicare to the population when it is clearly an electoral exercise using taxpayers' money to fund advertisements to support the ALP election campaign. I understand that the amount may be as high as $3 1/2m. This is a travesty of usage of taxpayers' money to support the election campaign of the ALP. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to remind the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) that our Labor Government's record on health is second to none. In 1984 Medicare gave all Australians access to a very fair universal system of health insurance. Until that time and under a Fraser Liberal Government almost two million Australians did not have any health insurance whatsoever. Under this Government's Medicare, all Australians are covered, at a reasonable cost, and the cost of medical services is more under control. However, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) plans to privatise health, shifting the emphasis away from a public health system towards private insurance, private hospitals and higher incomes for doctors and specialists. His plans would mean higher health costs for all Australians, putting profits before patients.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. The truth hurts. I repeat that Medicare has been made broader and stronger by our 1992 Budget, with an extra $1.3 billion to be spent on public hospitals around the country over the next six years. This will ensure that access to a hospital bed depends on one's medical condition, not on one's level of insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback, however, would cut at least $8 billion in government funding to public hospitals over that same period. This 1992 Budget also contains a $70m plan to cut hospital waiting lists, $68.3m to improve general practitioner services, $93m to give carers extra respite services, and a Medicare patients charter to protect patients' rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare has successfully delivered universal access to health care while keeping health costs to around 8 per cent of the gross domestic product. With an ageing and growing population, demand for health services has significantly increased, yet the cost of our health system has not blown out. The Budget measures require a minor increase in the Medicare levy from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent of taxable income from July 1993. This increase will cost families on the average weekly wage just 80c a week extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, however, could not deliver his promises on health. His policies would guarantee access to high quality health care for the wealthy, while the middle and low income earners and non-pensioners face the prospect of massive out-of-pocket cost and pensioners face the prospect of doctors with no incentive to bulkbill. Under a coalition government's health policies, bulkbilling would be abolished for everyone except pensioners and card holders, returning to the bad old days of public health care being charity care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition would like to place public hospitals under increasing pressure by slashing $1.3 billion a year from their funding. His policies would blow out national spending on health by $2 billion a year. The Opposition plans to subsidise private health insurance through $850m each year in tax penalties and incentives that force people to take out private insurance, plus a $565m direct government grant to the private health funds. This would be a $1.4 billion outlay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, the Opposition's health policies would increase the cost of all types of medical care for ordinary Australians. A coalition government would shift the emphasis of Australia's health policy from fairness to user pays. A person's access to quality health care would be determined by his ability to pay, because the Leader of the Opposition would force Australians to take out private health insurance. Medicare provides Australians with a universal system. The Opposition has told us that it would re-introduce two classes of health care&mdash;public health for pensioners and welfare recipients, and private health care for everyone else. Australians could no longer rely on Medicare for its simplicity, its universality and its low cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury has estimated that the health cost would rise by 22.6 per cent under Fightback, adding 0.7 per cent to the CPI. Medical insurance and medical fees would no longer be set by the government, but by the Australian Medical Association, using the AMA schedule. The AMA schedule, as we all know, is 30 per cent higher than the Medicare schedule. Even today, under Medicare, there are doctors who charge by the AMA schedule, blatantly ignoring the Medicare schedule of fees. Unfortunately for many Australians, this situation would be the norm under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received a number of complaints from constituents regarding the level of fees some doctors are charging, which often results in many of them being left out of pocket and cynical about our health system. One recent complaint I received was in regard to an operation. My constituent was informed by the specialist who was performing that operation that it would cost a total of $468 in gap payments after Medicare and private health insurance had covered the cost up to the Medicare schedule fee. However, after the operation my constituent received bills from the hospital, the anaesthetist, the pathologist and the assistant surgeon, which left a total gap debt of $1,093 to pay&mdash;a far cry from the $468 that she was told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly concerned about the amount that the pathologist charged my constituent, which was more than $160 in excess of the Medicare schedule fee. This doctor also charged my constituent for a service which is not recognised by the Health Insurance Commission because the service provided was more to assist the surgeon than the patient&mdash;yet the patient was expected to pay. Under a Hewson coalition government this type of treatment of patients is likely to continue as doctors and specialists will have a free reign to charge whatever they like for their services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women in particular will be worse off under the Opposition's health policies. Women with special needs, such as those who are on the in-vitro fertilisation program&mdash;the IVF&mdash;will have even more difficulties than they currently face. It was recently brought to my attention by a constituent that women on the IVF program are covered by Medicare only for the first six attempts at pregnancy in a lifetime. After that, these women must fully cover the cost of trying to have a family themselves. My constituent finds this particularly distressing as she and her spouse have severe financial restraints on their budget and are now finding it difficult to make ends meet. When we consider that each full attempt at pregnancy costs at least $2,500, many Australians will be forced to seriously reconsider their desire to have that family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was this Government which in 1990 spent an average of $320 per person per day housing, clothing and feeding 1,500 illegal immigrants in our illegal migrant detention centres. This Government also picks up the tab for thousands of women who have their children through the public hospital system and have&mdash;and so they should&mdash;as many children as they like without having restraints put on them. I must admit that I am disturbed that our Government, which can spend so much money housing and feeding illegal immigrants and happily paying for the cost of having children in a public hospital, can put a limit on the number of times a couple can attempt to fall pregnant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One in seven couples in Australia today is infertile. Why should these people, just because they, by some act of God, are unable to fall pregnant normally, be disadvantaged through our Medicare system? Many of these couples would dearly love to have just one child, yet as a result of the limited number of times they can attempt to fall pregnant and be covered by Medicare, they have to give up their dream of being parents. Although Medicare is equitable and fair in so many other ways, I believe that this situation is shameful. Perhaps we should consider spending money helping these couples populate our country rather than spending it on looking after illegal immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I truly fear for these people if a coalition government is elected. I am sure they would be faced with even more devastating costs in their attempts at having a family. Unfortunately, under a coalition government, most Australians would be worse off in regard to health. According to data now collected by the national health strategy, many Australian households spend little or nothing by way of out-of-pocket costs on health. The latest figures show that nearly half of all households spend nothing on health and that three-quarters spend less than $4 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the coalition's package, bulkbilling would be available only to pensioners and health care card holders. The up-front cost of a visit to a GP would be likely to raise to the AMA schedule fee, which is now $31. The refund from Medicare would be cut from 85 per cent to 75 per cent. For a visit to a GP costing $31, Medicare would pay only $17.62&mdash;75 per cent of the $23.50, which is the Medicare schedule fee for a GP visit. The patient would be out of pocket by $13.38, compared with no cost under the present system for a bulkbilled patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To partly cover this cost, people could buy, as Fightback told us, extra gap insurance at $6 a week per family&mdash;more than $300 a year&mdash;but it would give them only an extra $8.70 back for each visit, still leaving them out of pocket by $4.68 each visit, plus the $6 a week gap insurance. One of the most frightening aspects of the health policy of the Leader of the Opposition is that Australians would be forced to take out private health insurance cover. The coalition would put a surcharge on top of the Medicare levy. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to talk about those elderly sick people who need nursing-type care, whether at home or in nursing homes. Tonight I raise the point that the Government, through its policies and practices, fails to adhere to the charter of residents' rights which it introduced with a great fanfare of publicity. The Government adopts a heavy-handed and self-righteous attitude in projecting itself as the champion of residents' rights. It portrays nursing homes as still operating in the Dickensian era and as persistently abusing the rights of their residents. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of one of my constituents is a clear illustration in stark terms of the paternalistic state denying rather than protecting the rights of elderly residents of nursing homes. The constituent to whom I refer is elderly. She is a double amputee who also suffers from memory loss. She loves, and loved, her home. Through the support of a devoted husband, she was able to remain in her home, even though for quite a long time she would have been medically qualified for admission to a nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time she has progressively become more dependent. As this has occurred, her husband has engaged the services of a private nursing and support service organisation. That organisation provided to her services that assisted with her personal hygiene, toileting and beauty treatments. It took her on outings, where that was appropriate, read to her aloud, encouraged memories of past stories and life events, and kept her company in a way that involved the development of personal relationships with those who were assisting her, who provided her with the tender loving care that we would expect should be available to people with such ailments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But recently her care needs increased to the point where there was no real alternative but for her, medically qualified as she was, to be admitted to a nursing home. The home to which she has been admitted has excellent facilities and a caring and hard working staff. There are, however, limits to the level of care and attention that that staff can provide, and those limits are essentially imposed by government fiat executed through the limits on the resources available through the funding of nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent's husband was anxious to ensure that his wife continued to receive the number of hours of nursing and caring service to which she had become used, and to continue the opportunity of contact with carers who had developed a personal relationship with her. They sought the opportunity to engage that nursing service as a supplement to the services that could be provided within the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was that possible? No, it was not. In stepped the Government, which said no, it was not possible. Yet it would appear from the booklet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Your Guide to Residents' Rights in Nursing Homes</EMPHASIS> that every action by the Government is a complete and utter denial of the rights that these charters and agreements purport to give to the residents of nursing homes. A First Assistant Secretary in the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, when application was made for permission for this extra service to be provided, said, `I am bound by the provisions of the National Health Act in relation to nursing home fees to deny the request'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a typical bureaucratic misinterpretation of the legislation. The relevant section relates to the services provided by the nursing home itself. It relates to the services provided and charged for by the nursing home. The Commonwealth clearly has responsibility to ensure that Commonwealth money in nursing homes is properly spent and properly allocated to the residents of those homes. It also has a proper responsibility to see that nursing home proprietors do not charge for extra services provided by others which thereby reduce the services that they, with Commonwealth money, should make available to the residents of their nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deny a private individual the opportunity of engaging caring professionals to carry out additional nursing and caring services within a nursing home on top of that which is required to be provided by the nursing home is a denial of the so-called charter of rights and the agreements which the Government expects nursing homes to enter into with their residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here there is a relationship not between the resident and the nursing home, not between the nursing home and the Government, but between the resident and those dear to that resident and a private organisation willing to provide professional service. I think it is a scandal that that additional service is not permitted to be provided. After all, the charter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The personal, civil, legal and consumer rights of each resident are not diminished in any way when he or she moves into a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA>Who is diminishing those rights? It is the Government and the bureaucrats misinterpreting this legislation denying this nursing service the right to enter this home at the expense of the resident's husband to provide the level of service that she experienced when she was living at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could give honourable members many examples of patients living in their homes who are medically qualified to enter nursing homes but are funding their own care. If we had a fair system of nursing home treatment and if that treatment was made available fairly, we would have a system whereby the resources that provided for the care of patients, as distinct from the capital requirements of providing accommodation for those patients, was made available whether the patient was in a nursing home or being nursed at home. That is the second point I make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point was that residents of nursing homes should not be denied the right to engage and obtain extra professional services to provide them with tender loving care in their declining years. The second point I make is that the basic funding that is available for caring in a nursing home to a nursing home resident should be made available to medically qualified patients who are living at home and are being provided with professional services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisations that are springing up around the country&mdash;teams of professionals, nurses, aid workers, assistants of varying kinds who design the profile of service that is provided to the patient to suit the patient's particular needs, varying it over time as the illness takes hold and greater care is needed&mdash;could perhaps be, if the Government so desired, listed as mobile nursing homes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not planned to join the debate on the appropriations for the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but I listened to the disgraceful contribution of the Opposition spokesman on health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) and felt that a bit of balance was needed in the debate on health insurance and that I should point out several of the options that will be available to Australians at the next election. I wish to look at the difference between private health insurance and public health insurance and to look at the issues that Australians should think about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view about private health insurance is that it exists in Australia only because governments, usually conservative governments, have never accepted their responsibilities. They honestly believed that the way governments should operate in health matters was to stay out of them and let the private sector take over, even though market forces never worked in medicine and never will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private health insurance itself is an artificial product. It needs props to hold it up. For instance, the shadow spokesman mentioned community rating. The community rating principle means that if one is young and healthy one makes the same contributions as does a member of the community that used the health care services a lot more frequently. There is no discrimination, if you like, as there are in other forms of insurance, between people who use the product very sparingly and those who use it quite often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community rating is one of the linchpins&mdash;in fact, private health insurance could not exist without it. The other prop which holds up private health insurance is the reinsurance pool to make sure that the newer private health insurance funds, which have a younger age profile, help to reinsure the older health funds through the pool. They are the two props that are holding up private health insurance. The other one we hear about now is the call for tax deductibility; that is, taking monies from the public purse to hold up this artificial product which by itself cannot maintain itself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is expensive, but it is also inefficient. For every $1 collected by private health insurance, 14c goes in administration. So 86c of each dollar collected by private health insurance is actually used to pay bills; the other 14c is consumed in administration. Comparing that with Medicare, 4c goes in administration and 96c actually gets to paying bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the choice between Medicare and private health insurance&mdash;and Australians have had that choice since 1984&mdash;what are Australians choosing? To obtain a measure of that, let us look at the percentage of Australians who are taking out private health insurance. If we compare 1984 with 1992, the figure has fallen from around 60 per cent of Australians to 40 per cent. Anybody without a degree and who is not an economist can stand back and say, `Maybe there is something wrong with private health insurance because so few Australians are taking it out'. The reason they are not taking it out is that there is no value in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major advantage in taking out private health insurance is that one buys access. In fact, it should not be called private health insurance; it should be called private access cover, because that is what it is and that is its only value. When one takes out private health insurance, one exposes oneself to larger bills. If one goes into hospital as a privately insured patient as opposed to a Medicare patient, the Medicare patient does not get a bill, but the privately insured patient gets bills for sometimes thousands of dollars above the scheduled fee. That is its attractiveness to the medical profession. They want more privately insured patients so that they can charge them what they like. That is it in a nutshell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Medicare is a natural product. It does not need those struts; it does not need the community rating principle; it does not need the reinsurance pools; and it does not need tax deductibility. All of those things are built into Medicare. It is a natural product. That is why Medicare is the health insurance system that Australians are choosing now and will choose into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only advantage that private health insurance has is in access to hospitals. The medical profession uses this advantage ruthlessly. A number of constituents in my electorate have come to me and said that when they go to see their surgeons the first question that is asked when they go to the surgery is, `Are you privately insured?'. If one says no, they are told, `You will have to wait two years'. If one says, `I am privately insured', one can go in tomorrow. One has to ask oneself whether that is the way to run a health system. Should the health system run on the ability to pay?  Should a privately insured patient get into hospital straightaway?</PARA>

It is proposing to push working Australians back into private health insurance. For all of the advantages that those opposite say are gained under its scheme, one thing cannot be denied: it will cost Australians more. Even with the so-called inducements of up to $30,000 that the Opposition will offer&mdash;over $30,000 they use the stick to belt one into private health insurance&mdash;the total effect is that one will pay more out of one's own pocket for private health insurance, just for the cover.

An economist having a look at this would say, `Why would you collect $2,113m and pay $274m in administration costs to give about $1,600m to the doctors?'. It is a crazy policy. But it is even crazier to look at what areas of the medical profession would benefit under this policy. I asked the Parliamentary Library to do an analysis of where that $1,591m would be paid. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A dermatologist would increase his disposable income before tax by $132,000 a year; that is, every dermatologist in Australia would receive on average from the Opposition $132,000 a year under Fightback. This is at a time when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is telling the young people of Australia `You can work for $3 an hour' and at the same time telling the workers of Australia, `You don't get a pay rise'. The income for dermatologists would increase by $132,000; for obstetricians by $123,000; and for physicians by $100,000. This is on top of what they are earning now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not be fooled by the Opposition saying that they have got practice costs because they are already paid for. This is money from Fightback over and above that which they are earning now. The Fightback policy is aimed squarely and fairly at increasing the incomes of the medical profession. Is it any wonder that when the Leader of the Opposition addressed the AMA conference here in Canberra we heard the cries of `Music to our ears', to which they could have said, `And change in our pockets'. What a great policy it is, but it does nothing to enhance the health insurance arrangements of Australians. Under the private health insurance arrangements that the Leader of the Opposition will bring in, there will be no cap on what doctors can charge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was speaking earlier in this debate about the Government's sophisticated housing policy because it is a policy which includes all forms of tenure, both public and private, in the mortgage and rental markets and in public housing. It is a policy that has been built up over at least 10 years. It enables people to have a choice of tenure, and when they are in housing stress&mdash;that is, when they do not have enough money to afford rent or whatever&mdash;the Government is able to assist them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me considerably that much of this work built up over the last 10 years may well be destroyed under an Opposition policy whereby, firstly, there will be the introduction of a goods and services tax that will affect the affordability of private houses and, secondly, and probably more importantly, there will be something like $1 billion cut out of the Commonwealth effort in public housing out of a $9 1/2 billion program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition intends to make sure that most of the public housing stock in this country is sold off. Some of that money will be used to subsidise rents for those who will subsequently have to take up rental in the private market. What worries me is that the amount of money shifted across to subsidise the private rental market will not be able to make up the shortfall between the cost of capital, the cost of subsidy of taking up that rental and the amount of money that people currently have to pay in rents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sectors of the housing market should have a close look at the implications of the alternative to our sophisticated housing policy which right now, I would suggest, ensures that nearly everyone has a choice&mdash;the potential to get into a house of their own or into public or private housing, paying rent that is acceptable and affordable. Sure we can improve things, but we have gone a long way down the track. Essentially, the Opposition wants to slash and redirect public housing funds of $1 billion. A total of $400m of that cut will be made up by forcing the State governments to sell off public housing stock and the remainder, as I understand the Opposition's policy, would be diverted into private rental subsidies, emergency accommodation, management costs and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us break this up into its constituent elements. How will this affect public tenant rental rebates? At the moment the States provide rental rebates for tenants in return for interest-free Commonwealth funding for new public housing. But if the States have to raise private funds for housing, they will not be able to maintain those rent rebates. This means that either the Commonwealth will have to provide public tenant rental rebates or public housing tenants will have to pay market rents. Market rents are about 100 per cent higher than the current subsidised rent. So those people who are now in subsidised rental public housing may be facing something like a 100 per cent increase in their rent under these alternative proposals. That is not smart; it is damaging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell honourable members that I will be writing to every single public tenanted person in my electorate, of which there are some thousands, and I will tell them straight out that their rent may well double as a consequence of the alternative policy. Right now their rents are affordable because the Commonwealth subsidises their rent. The Commonwealth says to those people, `Look, we know that on your income you can't afford decent accommodation. Therefore, the Commonwealth will subsidise your rent so you can have decent accommodation either in public housing stock or in private housing stock'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second leg of the double here is that the Opposition would wish to sell off, dispose of, public housing stock. There is an argument about whether we should spend more money on subsidy in the private rental market or hold onto public housing stock. I accept that there is a debate. But there is a danger in disposing of public rental housing stock because it will never be replaced. No government in the future, once having disposed of that stock, will make the enormous capital investment to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Australians are well housed, not in stress and not fearing that they will have to spend 30 per cent or more of their income in order to be decently housed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point: if we want to make a shift and have more people housed in the private rental market, we have a problem. Those opposite assume that the private sector will take up the supply of rental housing, but that is a very dangerous assumption because currently the shortfall between the cost of funds and rents for public housing is about 5 to 6 per cent. To ensure a supply of affordable rental accommodation, our opponents would need to offer either extra subsidies for low income people or tax breaks for investors, which means that if it cannot come up with the money&mdash;patently it has already told us that it is not about to throw the amount of subsidy in that we do&mdash;rents will be put beyond the means of an enormous number of individuals. What is more, the private investor will not want to invest because he or she will not be able to get the returns that would normally be achieved. So the Commonwealth subsidy at the moment actually helps make more viable the private rental market for poorer people. The goods and services tax that the Opposition wishes to introduce will have an impact on landlords' costs. </PARA>

Some of those business costs will be taxed. It is inevitable that rents will go up whilst ever landlords wish to make the sort of return that they believe they are entitled to. So the subsidies diminish and the costs to the landlord go up. Therefore, the private rental market is going to be under severe stress. The public rental market will be destroyed because property will be disposed of.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about private houses per se?

Unquestionably, Mr Lavin's comments are a clear indication that the proposal by President Bush to establish `a strategic network of free trade agreements across the Pacific' was serious and not, as the Government has attacked it, simply pitched for votes in the presidential election. There are prospects for detailed negotiations on improved trade access to the United States should the President win the forthcoming election.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to an article on page 1 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 5 October, under the heading `Keating should prepare for cold shoulder if Bush wins', by Gregory Hywood, in Austin.

<PARA>I will repeat that: `the deepest rift in US-Australian relations in a generation'. Mr Hywood went on in the article to talk of the damage that could be done&mdash;without any trouble at all&mdash;in ignoring Australia's interests in the future if the United States were moved to strike back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a Prime Minister who leaves a trail of devastation wherever he goes&mdash;a charlatan who stalks the nation and wreaks havoc on the economy and does not confine himself to the jurisdiction of Australia alone. An article written by a cool analyst of international affairs and the economy in Gregory Hywood describes the behaviour of the Prime Minister in Japan in leading to what he said is `perhaps the deepest rift in US-Australian relations in a generation'. Put rather more coolly, rather than attack the Bush proposal, the Prime Minister would have best served Australia's interests by looking at how the Bush proposal could be practically implemented to take into account Australia's concerns in its relations with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also significant that in the interview I mentioned at the outset Mr Frank Lavin indicated that free trade agreements could also be sought by the United States with Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan. Clearly, entering into a free trade agreement or arrangement with the United States will not lead, as some have said, to a severance of Australia's ties with east Asia but offers the prospect of strengthening the important trilateral relationship that exists between Australia, east Asia and the United States, for Australia's exports to east Asia are very much dependent on east Asia's continued access to the North American market, in particular the predominant United States market, and any proposal from the United States which offers the prospect of strengthening that trilateral relationship ought be welcome. </PARA>

Furthermore, in the interview I have mentioned, Frank Lavin made the important comment that Australia could be using the negotiation process to try to remove the impediments which presently exist to Australia-United States trade&mdash;indeed, the sort of thing that the Opposition has been drawing attention to and the sort of thing that the Government has treated with ne'er a whimper. Indeed, the Opposition has long argued that the Bush proposal and the offer by President Bush in January to establish a trade and investment framework agreement offered the prospect of a mechanism for dispute resolution which cannot be underestimated. </PARA>

But governments have to work with the government of the day. Unless and until there is any change, there is a serious proposition which has simply been derided and opposed by this Government, not at any cost to it personally but, as ever, at great cost to Australia and therefore to the Australian people. The loss to Australia could be incalculable. I say again what Gregory Hywood wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Keating's comments . . . reflect what is perhaps the deepest rift in US-Australian relations in a generation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is some statement. It takes a touch of exquisite genius to bring that about on a quick trip to Tokyo. And for what purpose? Why does Australia line up with anyone? Our interests are in trading wherever the opportunity exists. Our interests are not in taking anyone's side in any trade conflict between Japan and the United States. The proposition is absurd and the devastation that has been laid in the wake of this visit to Tokyo has been accurately surmised and stated by Mr Hywood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this Prime Minister is a chronic poseur, unable to see anything but the small domestic pursuit of votes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose to say that, and I have to say in conclusion that on the important point of the damage that is being done by the United States export enhancement program the fact is that we are already having severe difficulties with the United States and its export enhancement program. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) recently said, there should be no illusion about the damage caused by the United States subsidised exports of agricultural products. Over recent weeks, the Opposition has certainly taken objections on this issue to the Americans more forcefully and more directly than the Government has done, but that is no reason to behave in the damaging manner that the Prime Minister did in Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that it is only the Opposition which has a coherent and valuable trade policy for this nation. It is a very easy thing to say, but we have argued it at length outside.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for the protection of Australia's national interests across a wide spectrum of issues. This includes management of Australia's trade relations with other countries, our membership of various international bodies, protection of the environment, efforts to promote global and regional security, development assistance, the protection of the interests of Australian citizens abroad and the promotion of a better understanding of Australia and other countries through public information and cultural activities, just to name a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia currently maintains 100 posts overseas, 89 of which are managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Some 1,241 Australian officials are employed in these posts, 814 of them from the Department. Last financial year the Department's outlay was $2,011,800,000, with an estimate of $2,114,680,000 for the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over half of these amounts are allocated to Australia's development assistance program administered by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, which comes within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the management side, there has been a continuing review of portfolio priorities which has resulted in the reallocation of resources to higher priority areas. This has, in relation to the Department itself, recently included decisions to close a number of posts in Europe and to strengthen existing posts in the Asia-Pacific region, which is of major priority to the Government. Equally, resources allocated to Austrade, which is also within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, for its posts in the region have been strengthened to target the priority markets for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue of foreign policy that I wish to comment on is the emerging debate in the Asia-Pacific region on the concept known as `common security'. The notion of common security was originally given shape and articulated by the Olof Palme Commission, headed by the former Prime Minister of Sweden, which sought ways to reverse the arms race spiral during the 1980s. The concept found its way into the debate on Asia-Pacific security and particularly received support from the so-called peace groups and anti-nuclear movements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the end of the Cold War, the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States and President Bush's proposals for a new world order, the idea of common security has gained a certain momentum in the Asia-Pacific region. The official Australian position as articulated by Senator Evans has tended to support a policy of `an interlocking web of contacts, dialogue arrangements and cooperative strategies throughout the region which would improve confidence'. This is to check any trend of competitive arms acquisition without necessarily promoting the establishment of a new multilateral forum in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, may I single out that it is designed to not promote a conference on security and cooperation in Asia, despite its promotion in certain quarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Australian position runs the risk of being misplaced if the process of gaining acceptance for the principles of common security moves too quickly. The reason for my scepticism is that, firstly, the countries of the Asia-Pacific region have little common interest and, unlike the situation which obtained in western Europe during the Cold War, they do not have a common adversary to unite them. Furthermore, there is no existing framework for common military cooperation, nor is there clear regional cohesion to economic matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dilemma facing Australian foreign policy makers in addressing this issue is seen in just one example&mdash;that is, the seeming impossibility of any form of naval arms control in the Pacific. As distinct from the European theatre, the security problems faced by many Asia-Pacific countries are moderated by water. As Geoffrey Wiseman observed in an article dealing with common security in the Asia-Pacific region:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The naval issue in the Pacific clearly presents problems. The general flexibility of navies, their physical capacity and their legal right to movement across the high seas, when taken along with the existence of maritime disputes and the resource potential of the sea, suggests a set of problems which ideas of common security, defensiveness and even army control will find difficult to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA>This important issue for Australian foreign policy will receive sharper focus with the prospect of China using Hong Kong as a base for projecting naval power to the south after 1997. This development would pose an ominous ingredient in the unresolved dispute between China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines over the resources of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Added to this is the extraordinarily rapid arms build-up that is occurring in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Taiwan and South Korea, and the prospect of increasing stress in the relationship between the United States and Japan. Combined, they would present the greatest challenge faced by Australian foreign policy makers over the last 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I do support the development of confidence building measures between the nations of the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;for example, agreements to prevent military incidents at sea, notification of exercises and exchange of naval ship visits and military personnel. Although unpublicised, several confidence building measures have been adopted between Australia and Indonesia. These include exchanges of visits by our respective defence Ministers, information exchange between our defence forces and Indonesian observation of Australia's military exercises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While these initiatives are welcome, Australian foreign policy makers should proceed with great caution in developing these so-called confidence building measures with our regional neighbours. These measures should be allied to policy that has been consolidated before hastening into any bilateral or multilateral arrangements. I know that Senator Evans is fully cognisant of these concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of trade. Australia's foreign trade policy is designed to complement the structural reforms of the Australian economy undertaken by this Government in recent years. One of the major goals of the domestic reforms has been to make Australian businesses more competitive internationally. The fact is that these policies are succeeding. Australia's trade performance has been very strong by world standards. Australian export earnings have reached record  levels  despite  subdued  world trading conditions and depressed commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our export volumes have risen strongly. For example, in the 1991-92 financial year they were 10 per cent above the previous year's levels. Australia recorded the fastest growth in manufactured export volumes in both 1990 and 1991 of any OECD country. Our growth rate of export volumes was also twice that of world trade in 1990 and almost four times that of world trade in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there has been a qualitative change in the composition of our exports. Elaborately transformed manufactures, for example, have grown fastest of all our exports&mdash;in fact, over 300 per cent between 1981 and 1991. In my electorate the value of exports through the Townsville port for 1991-92 approximated that of the value of total exports from South Australia&mdash;over $1.9 billion. Much of the exports through the Townsville port were elaborately transformed manufactures. Indeed, the value of exports from north Queensland in 1991-92 was nearly $7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Townsville Austrade office has found that where there are established industries, such as sugar, mining, railway, port and transportation and materials handling industries, there is usually an array of satellite industries supporting these major industries and often an array of innovative products such as spare parts, maintenance techniques and equipment and add-on products that become earners of export income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, in my electorate we have one major industrial concern that actually imports ore from overseas, refines it, packages it and exports it, and does it better even than in  Japan. It is a great success story. The Townsville and district exporters are producing a wide range of goods for export from Australia. It is a great success story. In fact, one particular company, Curtain Brothers, is exporting over $100m worth of goods to Papua New Guinea. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to these estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I would like to confine my remarks primarily to the foreign affairs aspects in particular. Of course, there is a smorgasbord of issues that one could address in any debate of this sort. In the few moments available to me, my comments will be primarily in relation to Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, I think, to see our region as one in which there exists the potential for enormous growth and development. It is also a region in which there exists great injustices, human rights violations and political instability. These issues affect the security and stability of the entire region and necessarily affect the pace at which economic development can occur, not to mention the pace at which democratic reform can occur. Here in Australia we as a regional power need to use what influence we have to assist in the processes of economic and democratic reforms within our region. In that context Australia has taken a very positive role in relation to the peace process in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a new issue for me. I have taken a great deal of personal interest in the plight of the Khmer people in the time that I have been in the Parliament. I have had the opportunity of visiting Cambodia three times in recent years&mdash;probably more often than most parliamentarians. I first went there shortly after the liberation, in a sense, from the Khmer Rouge. This involved the subrogation by an occupying force from Vietnam. I had the opportunity of seeing at first-hand some of the horrors that so many people think they know about from seeing the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Killing Fields</EMPHASIS>. But the horrors were really understated if one simply got one's ideas from that film, horrific as it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity of visiting Cambodia with Senator Schacht at a later point in time when I saw that certain advances were occurring, although obviously a civil war continued which all of us wanted to see resolved. I had the opportunity to visit there again this year in May after our activist Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) had played a role in putting together a peace process, which certainly those who propagate the Government's interests would say was conclusive, determinative and produced an outcome which would bring peace to that troubled region. People were even proposing our Foreign Minister as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people lauded his involvement, and I do not criticise it because I think it is important to try to bring about a peaceful outcome in this exercise. But I think far too much credit was given to our Foreign Minister for what were thought to be achievements but which we now see, in the passage of time, were largely illusionary. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) paid a visit to Cambodia recently. I think there was probably an expectation on his part when plans were put in place in the beginning that it would be an opportune time for him to be there so he would be able to claim some credit for the way in which Australia had been involved in a process which had brought the UN into Cambodia and led to the prospect that it would be on the path to elections which might bring about an outcome which the people of Cambodia had determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited Cambodia in May this year with a great deal of apprehension. I went there with the express purpose of seeing the Australian troops who were participating in this peace process. I also went to meet with some of the Khmer leadership and the United Nations leadership, including distinguished Australians such as Lieutenant-General Sanderson. I went to see the Australian troops who were part of the UNTAC operation and to meet those who were going to play a part in supervising elections and monitoring human rights issues and the like. I also met with many representatives of the non-government agencies&mdash;the UN agencies&mdash;and, along with my colleague the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), undertook a very difficult visit to Kompong Thom. We undertook the visit by road for the purpose of seeing that part of Cambodia which has continued to be plagued by quite hostile Khmer Rouge activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met with provincial officials and the local governor and drove some 40 kilometres up route 12 to the scene of some of the clashes that had occurred around that time between the forces of the state of Cambodia as well as the Khmer Rouge forces. We also saw some of the people who, tragically, had been displaced as a result of recent fighting in that area. We had the opportunity of seeing some of the sites of serious ceasefire violations, although the town in which we stayed was not affected and the road on which we travelled was quiet at that time. When I read about these events as they unfolded at later points in time, I was certainly very much more aware of the circumstances about which people were writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take the opportunity in this discussion to mention the role of the Australian Forces because they are there in a very difficult situation. They are doing a very professional job, a very important job, and one which supports the UN in its efforts. One would certainly hope that those efforts will not be in vain. It is unfortunate, however, that because of the lack of cooperation by the Khmer Rouge in the efforts by the United Nations we are seeing a significant deterioration in the internal circumstances in Cambodia. There is a significant economic deterioration. Its economy is now experiencing high levels of inflation and that is likely to make the task of the peace process even more difficult. We are seeing an increase in lawlessness and a loss of life as a consequence. We are seeing events and circumstances in Cambodia that have not been witnessed for quite a long time. All of that is unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Evans, in the light of the adoption of his proposals, was very critical of any of those who cast any doubt about the Government's undue optimism. But it is important to note that as recently as September, in the debates in the Senate, Senator Evans admitted that the Khmer Rouge is unlikely to rejoin the peace process. He has made it clear that an alternative may need to emerge if one is to get the peace process back on the rails. He has indicated that there are a number of options, including sanctions against the Khmer Rouge, isolating it in the zones that it presently controls, or the peacekeeping operation pulling out altogether. The difficulty with all of that is that it means that all of the expense that has been associated with this peacekeeping effort would be to nought. Senator Evans said that Australia would support economic sanctions against the Khmer Rouge. But getting the involvement of China and Thailand in relation to those matters is very difficult to this point in time. They have generally indicated that they are not prepared to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk for much longer about the various options and the need for positive steps in this regard. It is regrettable as we talk about this issue at this time that we cannot be optimistic. It is a pity that the Foreign Minister, in relation to the earlier hopes which he held out, spoke so optimistically, and sought this Nobel Peace Prize accolade when it was always clear that this situation would not be readily resolved. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is sitting at the table, yesterday I returned from a very interesting trip to the European parliamentary institutions, the European Commission and the Netherlands. I would like to make a couple of comments first of all about conclusions from that very interesting trip. The first conclusion, and perhaps the most worrying, is that economic activity in Europe is quite slack at present. In Britain there is a very severe recession; in Germany the growth rate is very slow indeed; in France it is not much better; and the other countries are similar. We cannot expect much stimulus from Europe in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one market which is coming into operation at the end of this year is already making a difference and will continue to stimulate economic activity within the European Community and amongst all the countries that export to it. Australia is amongst those countries, and we will benefit from that. The estimates for the growth stimulus from the one market vary between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of GDP. That is quite an important stimulus. It comes over a period, but it will encourage economic development in Europe and, therefore, in its trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Maastricht Treaty, which is a treaty that one would want to support on the grounds of the support it gives to the one market, has, at the same time as it is valuable for political and economic reasons, a deflationary impact in the short term on economic activity. It gives pre-eminence to a goal of reducing inflation&mdash;rather than to a goal which would be more balanced of inflation reduction&mdash;at the same time as it gives a stimulus to economic activity and to employment. Also, by proposing the establishment of an independent central bank which has one central goal, inflation reduction, it will encourage a preoccupation with that deflationary goal to the neglect of other economic goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the standardisation of fiscal policy, which is part of the treaty, will likewise have a deflationary impact on some countries. That is already evident in Italy, Sweden and Belgium. It may also have an impact on other countries too. So in the short term, or even in the medium term, it does not look likely that economic activity will really pick up strongly in Europe, and we must build that into our forecasts of the stimulus that we will get from the rest of the world. We are fortunate, of course, that our trade with East Asia has grown so strongly during the 1980s and, as a result, we are getting a major impulse of economic growth from what is now the area with which we do the largest part of our trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting aspects of our visit was discussions we had with a number of politicians, including the Dutch Prime Minister, about what in Europe they call the democratic deficit. By that they mean that there has been a tendency for too much of the decision making to be done by bureaucrats and not enough to be done by accountable politicians. There was a general recognition of that as a result of the French referendum which was such a close yes vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dutch Prime Minister emphasised to us the importance of what they call the principle of subsidiarity, by which they mean that decisions should be made at the lowest level where it is appropriate to make them and that decisions should not be concentrated amongst the European Commission in Brussels but should be at the national, regional or local level as far as possible. That seems to be a very important principle. As long as it is effectively applied, it will allay a lot of the fears of people in Europe who are concerned that the Maastricht Treaty will lead to greater centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the important lessons, I think, that the parliamentary delegation learnt in Europe was that in Europe there is a process of effective parliamentary monitoring of many of the international institutions. It was very interesting for us all to take part in the debate about the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development at the parliamentary assembly. That parliamentary assembly, which has representatives from all the parliaments in the countries which are members of the OECD&mdash;which now includes Australia, of course&mdash;can take part in a debate about the annual report of the OECD and its activities. We heard an interesting report from the Secretary-General. We were able to question him. There was then a debate about the activities of the organisation during the year. Some of it was sceptical, some of it constructive, but I think it was useful for the OECD because it was an outside assessment of the organisation's activities during the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That principle of parliamentary monitoring of international organisations could well be applied more extensively than just to the European institutions. For example, I would like to see it applied to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund&mdash;something that the bank and the fund might not welcome, but something that would increase their accountability to the parliaments and therefore to the peoples of the world and which would ensure that there was some scrutiny of their activities in an organised and effective way. I hope that recommendation will appear in the report of the trade subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade which is now looking at the fund and the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of issues that I want briefly to touch on relates to overseas development assistance. One of the impressive experiences while we were in Europe was to again see, and be reminded of, the generosity of many of the European governments in their aid programs. The Dutch, of whom we were guests for a week, continue to give about one per cent of their GDP in aid. At a time when many countries fund their aid programs under severe financial constraints, it is an inspiration to all of us to try to build up our aid program. For that reason, and others, I wholeheartedly congratulate our Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) and our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) for their effectiveness in getting through Cabinet, at a difficult financial time, a one per cent real increase in our aid program&mdash;</PARA>

One of them was the inevitable mantra on foreign aid that we get from the Labor Party about how it is somehow morally superior to the coalition in this issue. As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was pointing out to his former school mate from Scotch College in Melbourne, it is not just that the percentage of foreign aid as a proportion of GDP provided by the present Government is the lowest that has been achieved by any government in Australia since we have been donors to developing countries through our foreign aid program. The other aspect is the type of aid that the Government is giving. The aid organisations seem to be taking this debate to the point where the amount of dollars provided, the proportion of GDP, is the only issue that matters.

At a time when ACFOA is prepared to criticise the coalition and apparently not the Government, it makes private remarks to us and other members of this Parliament to the effect that the Labor Party has not only reduced aid as a proportion of GDP, but it has also increasingly used the aid budget as nothing short of an export subsidy. In other words, it has turned aid away from what it is supposed to be&mdash;that is, humanitarian assistance to those in real difficulties in developing countries&mdash;to a form simply of export subsidy. That equation ought to be built into its criticisms of foreign aid.

I feel that in Australia we take very much for granted the end of the Cold War phenomenon and the view that somehow world peace has broken out forever. I want to remind the chamber that there are four features of the post-Cold War world that we in Australia ought to be much more aware of than, frankly, I think we are and which ought to be factored into both our foreign affairs policy and also into our defence policy. The first of those four features is obviously the end of superpower rivalry, as in the decision by the former Soviet Union, the Russians, and the United States to reduce their nuclear arsenals. But that does not mean there is no longer a concern within what is now sometimes described as the CIS about nuclear weapons. We have gone really effectively from one single nuclear power to a series of nuclear powers, not the least Georgia, the Ukraine and Russia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern about that is widely held within the United States Administration and, frankly, I do not think is properly understood here in Australia and is something we ought to keep some notice of. There has, of course, also been a decline in the conventional forces of the United States and the CIS. We have seen that closer to home with the withdrawal of the United States from the Philippines&mdash;admittedly, on the insistence of the Philippines Senate&mdash;and the virtual withdrawal of what were the Soviet Union, now the Russian, forces from Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam and their withdrawal from the Indian Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first feature is the end of the superpower rivalry we saw in the past, and that obviously is a good thing. But in its place has arisen what is nowadays described as multipolarity. The European Community, Japan, China and India have all become focuses of power which in the age of superpower rivalry they simply were not. We have to understand in this country that that actually complicates, not simplifies, international diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> newspaper quite recently made the rather macabre point that there was a sort of comfort in the Cold War in that it was easily comprehensible. Without the Cold War&mdash;and I am not saying that we want to go back to it; of course we do not&mdash;we have a much more complicated sort of world in which to operate. Old animosities, for example, are able more easily to re-emerge. We have seen that in the Balkans with a dispute that goes back to the fifth or sixth century. We have seen an outbreak of animosities with considerable difficulties in the old Soviet republics. There is the dispute in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea which other speakers have referred to. These are difficult issues for us to address and for the international community broadly to address. So this is something which we as a country need to focus much more on than we perhaps have done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there has obviously been an improvement in other respects in global cooperation&mdash;what President Bush described at one stage as the `new world order', meaning not what the League of Rights thinks it happens to mean, some unholy conspiracy, but a new world order which is about cooperation within the United Nations and, in particular, in the Security Council. We have seen the consequences of that through the process of the Gulf war and in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that expectations are not raised too high in terms of what the United Nations can achieve. If those expectations are too high, then I believe in time people will be disillusioned by the failure of the United Nations to do really very much more than it has so far been able to achieve. If expectations are dashed and disillusion sets in, then that whole sense of global cooperation could break down more quickly than we might expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the weapons proliferation issue and also the building of higher technology throughout the world. Nuclear weapons proliferation remains an enormous global problem. We all know about Iraq of course, but there is also North Korea, South Africa, India, perhaps Pakistan and perhaps Israel. The South African Government officially denies it has any nuclear capability. We are not entirely sure, but perhaps that is right. There is no practical reason, I suppose, to disbelieve them. But it is worth our while focusing on that nuclear proliferation as an ongoing global problem, as also is the proliferation of conventional weapons and high technology weapons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a climate which we have to learn to address and learn to live with. We will not achieve that through fancy solutions, such as trying to establish a conference on security cooperation for Asia&mdash;some kind of megasecurity network. We need to work through normal diplomatic channels to establish a web of bilateral and multilateral security ties to make a contribution to greater security in our own region and encourage developments of that sort in other parts of the world. I hope in the years ahead our diplomacy will be directed towards that rather than foreign Ministers trying to make great statesmen of themselves by getting onto the front page of newspapers with fancy propositions which, frankly, just will not take us anywhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, my friend and colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), was another participant in the last European parliamentary delegation, which returned to Australia only last Sunday. My friend and colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is seated at the table on the other side of the chamber, is also a most compatible travelling companion. We learnt a lot on that trip, but in the brief time allowed to me tonight I will highlight only a few issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is the very grave&mdash;and, it appears, worsening&mdash;problem in the Balkans, in that series of countries once known as Yugoslavia. When the Allied armies entered the death camps in 1945 in Europe, Europe pledged to itself that never again would it allow such atrocities to occur. Never again, the world was told, would Europe stand by and allow anyone, or any group of people, to do such a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, not 50 years after the cessation of that conflict, European television almost nightly carries the very real and stark images of the same sorts of events happening again. Europe impressed me not at all with any ability to solve the crisis. The reaction from Europe appeared not so much to be slow&mdash;it certainly was less than deliberate; it certainly was worse than ambivalent; and it was scarcely positive at all. Europe has to be pushed by the rest of the world to solve what is undoubtedly a European problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One gets the impression across Western Europe that there is a prevailing attitude that for many centuries these people have been slaughtering each other in what was known as Yugoslavia, that it probably will continue for some time, and that the only hope we have of it slowing up is a good, strong winter and their coming to their senses. That really is an extremely poor and inhumane policy position for any group of nations to try to sustain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in the last 48 hours has added to the atrocities of what is undoubtedly genocide in parts of the old Yugoslavia. We have a new term now, coined by one British television reporter: eliticide. The leading academics, clerics and political figures are taken out of groups of Muslim captives and segregated in the death camps, and that elite of the Bosnian community is slaughtered. That is eliticide&mdash;yet another inhumane activity which is going on in the Balkans, on the doorstep of Europe, under the European nose and before its very eyes; it appears nightly on the television screens for all Europeans to see. I believe that Australia can continue to emphasise, and has to do so further, that there must be a greater European effort on this issue. The diplomatic and military conflicts in the Balkans obviously have some time to play out. That is most regrettable and hopefully something can be done about that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world must increase its effort to do something about the problem of death camps and genocidal activities. Australia can lift its head high on this issue. I think it has as much right as anyone else outside Europe, if not more, to say something about this. Our role in leading the world on war crimes legislation and our role in Cambodia in a very similar situation means that we have a rightful voice on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second issue I want to raise in the brief time available is in the context of our national interest in the foreign affairs field of endeavour. When we visited the Netherlands, one thing stood out quite starkly: some two-thirds of the Netherlands would naturally lie under water. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to sustain their country, the Dutch have for centuries pumped that water back into the ocean. That involves an expense of some four billion guilders every year. It is an expense they accept as part of the national course of events in order to live where they live. I think we can learn something from that, as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our greatest problem is our isolation. It is a root cause of some of our economic difficulties, and it is a root cause of many problems that Australians face in all sorts of fields of endeavour&mdash;not the least of which are sports and the arts. I propose that one of the things we need to do is create a new area of expenditure, albeit limited, in the area of foreign affairs, defence and trade&mdash;that is, something along the lines of ambassador funds. I believe that we need, as a Government and on behalf of the taxpayers of this country, to plant some seed money on an annual basis to enable our various sporting, artistic and cultural endeavours to be marketed in Europe, America and Asia. We have to cross the bridge, as it were, for those people in terms of costs&mdash;and particularly the costs of travel&mdash;and in so doing use those sports men and women and those artists to act as the great ambassadors and advertisements for this country that they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To support my proposition, let me cite quickly one of the experiences I had, again in the Netherlands, during the month I was away. I asked a very senior Dutch foreign affairs official what was the one thing that Australia could do to lift its profile in Europe. He thought for a while and then said, `Of course, you have <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS> here; that increases the Australian profile no end'. With all due respect to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS>, I moved the conversation along. After some consideration the gentleman said, `You should have your football team&mdash;I mean our football, soccer&mdash;visit Europe for a month. That would ensure national television coverage for Australia in every country of Europe'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one example of how Australia needs to market itself better. I believe that within the foreign affairs budget we need to have some sort of seed funding for our sports men and women, as well as for our artists and other various cultural pursuits, to regularly put the name of Australia before the eyes of the world and in so doing put Australia on the map more concretely so that we are thought of more often in those places where so many decisions in a variety of fields of endeavour are made. Not the least, of course, this would benefit those fields of endeavour for our domestic participants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian men and women in the areas of sports and the arts are exceptionally good marketers of themselves. I believe it is time we started using them to be exceptionally good marketers of Australia, as well. I am sure there would not be a member of this chamber who would disagree that they would be capable of being just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I want to raise, very briefly, was touched on to some extent by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), and that is arms proliferation. I would like to concentrate on non-nuclear arms proliferation. With the break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of communism across the Eastern Bloc, the drive of those nations involved to convert previously deployed economic and industrial resources away from arms production to civilian capacity, and the need for hard currency, there is at the moment a real incentive right across eastern Europe to sell arms. Already we are seeing down the Danube an arms trade which is not unrelated to the crisis in the Balkans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia, again in the international forum, has a role to play in stressing the need for non-nuclear arms proliferation treaties and action, with a special emphasis at this time on eastern Europe because we must remember that, in terms of regional conflicts, the cessation of such a proliferation of arms is in our interests, too. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The administration of trade policy under the Hawke and Keating governments has been an abject disaster. In my remarks on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I want to look at what has happened during the period of these two ministries and the consequences that flow for the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade has never been particularly significant to Labor. Its administration is now stretched over four ministries, a statutory authority and a range of commodity boards. Its priorities are always secondary to a range of other political interests. I want to look at just where we are and where we are going, because, as far as I am concerned, the amalgamation of the portfolios of foreign affairs and trade is only part of what to my mind has disguised a proliferation of responsibility which does not allow a concentration of effort at a time when Australia needs to look at its chronic adverse balance of payments, and when it needs to understand that the changing pattern of the world is such that we will not be able to survive as a significant economic force if we do not give greater priority to the whole of our trading opportunities. We need to understand that the extent to which we reduce the emphasis that needs to be given to bilateral, multilateral and individual commodity dealings overseas reduces the whole capacity of the Australian community to recover from the recession we had to have and the depression, whatever the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that we still suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the present administration. We have the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), the third most senior member of the Government. He still retains his responsibility for the development import finance facility. I am not sure of the exact state of play, but until recently he had responsibility for Austrade, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and the export development schemes. At this stage there is in process a hand-over which I think is nearly complete, but certainly he still retains responsibility for the development import finance facility and on a number of occasions has been the representative of the Government on trade missions overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next most senior is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). If we look at the structure of responsibility there we find that trade comes very much after all the other responsibilities of a political nature which properly have priority in terms of government to government contact of the Australian Administration with those overseas. The difficulty is not only that trade has been integrated with foreign affairs but that members of the trade section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade essentially have lost that commercial instinct and the commercial contact that gave the old departments of trade, whether it was Trade and Industry or Trade and Resources, the vitality that produced a quite different emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have a junior Minister, the failed Treasurer, the failed Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the present Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin). He has been a bit of a bunny in the whole business because his portfolio is not regarded as being as significant as it might by members of the Government. It is a portfolio that is changed frequently, and one is flat out trying to work out just where the present Minister sees his priorities. I think it is basically a matter of survival within the Ministry rather than what should be a prime responsibility for developing trade and looking at trade policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth Minister is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). His responsibilities are split with his colleague the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). Again we find that there seems to be some overlap, which I find a little confusing. I notice that the Minister for Resources is about to go to Taiwan. Presumably he is the only Minister that the Government feels it can allow to go because he has a parallel responsibility in tourism and the Government thinks it might be possible for him to be seen as not offending the People's Republic of China simply because he is a junior Minister and presumably does not matter a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of this split is that there is no single concentrated emphasis on trade policy, nor of an understanding of the different emphasis that the commercial world needs from the political world. I find that the product of the change and amalgamation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has both reduced the prior emphasis given to trade and also destroyed the capacity for the development of the bilateral understanding that used to exist in a range of significant and important commodities, minerals, manufacturing and in other fields of commercial interests which range across financial interests and otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In days gone by it was also true that it was the Deputy Prime Minister with his seniority who exercised responsibility within that Trade portfolio. For example, if one looks at the countries of the Middle East, I am sure that one of the reasons why we have had difficulty in adequately renegotiating the access for Australian live sheep exports into Saudi Arabia has been the reduced status of those who have been negotiating there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outside that we have Austrade which is now responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and, to my mind, Austrade fails in the concepts that it is required to pursue. In spite of the changes that occurred as a result of the survey conducted by McKinsey last year, there are problems which flow from the charter that it faces. As is stated in the Budget Papers, the objective of the Australian Trade Commission, of Austrade, is to increase the international success of Australian business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem is that it really is essential that there is an agency within government which has some understanding of trade policy and it is trade policy that has to be linked with the promotional efforts of individual trade commissioners. Frankly, I think we were far better off when we had a trade commissioner service which provided policy advice on a bilateral and multilateral level to government, instead of having Austrade which is divorced and has only part of the responsibility for promoting Australian trade in those markets where it is represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, there are enormous problems in the structure of the Austrade service. It has no responsibility at all for many of our major mineral exports. Government should not be involved, but if the Government wants to know what is happening, it certainly helps if major exporters have at least some relationship to that Department. While goodwill and commonsense have ensured that there has been a relationship between Austrade and many of those major companies like BHP, CRA and overseas markets, it only exists because of that common sense rather than because of the administrative structure of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade has inadequate priority in its administrative structure. It is spread over far too many portfolios. This has meant that, in the whole debate about Australian participation in NAFTA, there is total lack of understanding by the Government as to where and why we need to be able to understand the opportunities that are available. This is not specifically because we are looking at the regional break-up of trade, but because we are failing through the Cairns group to negotiate the reduction in world tariff and non-tariff barriers which is the prime purpose of the Uruguay Round of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far too much emphasis has been given to the Uruguay Round of GATT by neglecting the bilateral trade opportunities which still exist not only in Asia, but in every other market of the world. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) refer in his contribution to some of the emphasis that the Americans through President Bush are seeking to give to ensure that there is an increase in bilateral trade. Like everyone else, I am apprehensive about the products of the EEP but I am concerned that the way in which the Government is approaching the subject lacks emphasis and priority because of the overlap between the responsibilities of so many ministries, Ministers and individual agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is difficult at a time when the world commodity market is sliding, when the terms of trading are less than they might be and when essentially the opportunities that should be there in the commodity trade are also prejudiced by the severe drought we have had which has led to the declines in production. I do not see any chance of trade policy adopting the multilateral and bilateral complementary stance, with advice being available to the Government through individual trade commissioners who are there at a policy as well as an operative level, while there is the spread of interests which exists under the present Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, for all the priority that many of us believe needs to be given to trade and for all the Government criticises from time to time the NAFTA proposal of the Opposition and the suggestions that we have about moving into a greater emphasis on bilateral trade, it largely comes because of the total lack of emphasis by the Government for trade as a discipline and priority which is a very significant vehicle towards getting Australia out of its present depression. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The right honourable member is yesterday's man, well and truly, and his comments today clearly demonstrate that that is the case. I now turn to the issue of trade and why we should be getting it right. It is interesting to note that despite depressed world prices&mdash;to which in fact the right honourable member referred&mdash;our manufactured exports rose by nearly 10 per cent last year. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in Question Time today, much of this growth was because of increased sales in what are described as elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;that is, the high value added manufactures which topped $10 billion in exports in the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a far cry from the rhetoric and nonsense that we  often hear spoken by people in this place as to where we are heading. The year 1991 was a milestone in many respects, but particularly because manufactured exports exceeded rural based exports for the first time. That is a changed emphasis and it is something which I think is rather crucial to our future prosperity because manufactures and services are the growth areas in world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer honourable members to a number of recently published articles concerning how Australia's trade performance is improving, particularly in that area of manufactures. Of course, all the doomsayers have been claiming that we are not going anywhere; we are not into markets; we are not negotiating treaties, whether they be bilateral or multilateral; we are not concerned about our place in the world and so on. It is just so much garbage. In fact, there is a focus within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&mdash;and, indeed, in those other departments which have an emphasis on, and an interest in, our trade opportunities in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 2 October this year carries a very good cover story entitled `The new heroes who make and export'. The article talks about those very small- to medium-sized businesses which are in elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;those people who are the doers; who are getting out there, looking for the markets and are exporting considerable amounts of product into Asia particularly, but also into the other markets in Europe and elsewhere to which the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) referred. It is worth looking at that issue. In relation to such companies, the article in the current edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are small, flexible, aggressive and are willing to take risks because they believe in their products and know there is no future for those who are not bold enough to look beyond their national borders.</PARA>
<PARA>How very true that is. I think we need to see more of that sort of approach. Unfortunately, I am afraid that we in Australia do not give ourselves enough credit for the changes which have taken place in manufacturing and, indeed, with regard to subsequent exports. We are producing leading edge, original, practical products ahead of many of our competitors. I think we should be speaking about it, showing people that we are at the leading edge and that we are taking our products to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which has great significance for Australia at the present time&mdash;where I believe we have an incredible comparative advantage and something which will emerge very strongly as a major export revenue earner for Australia&mdash;is services trade. In fact, services trade is the fastest growing element in world trade. For example, in 1990 it grew by 17 per cent to reach the value of something like $US800 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our services exports in Australia are growing at around 20 per cent. As I have said, we have a comparative advantage in many of those services. Unfortunately, often it is not fully appreciated that those service industries contribute to something like a fifth of our total exports, and that share of our exports is increasing. We should also remember that these services to our other exports, as an input into those other exports, such as manufactures and minerals, when taken into account contribute more than any other export sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a number of years now we have exported engineering, banking and consultancy services. Recent big earners that have come to the fore in services trade include: tourism, which at the moment is earning Australia $8 billion a year; education, which is earning Australia $1 billion a year, and off-shore construction, which is earning Australia $2 billion a year. It is fascinating when one goes through places in Asia, in particular, and talks to people involved in the services area and in potential markets for Australian products to realise  that in services that opportunity is just enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me touch on one or two examples from a recent visit that I made to Asia to promote services trade. Education is an important area. In Japan, for example, we are doing very nicely out of postgraduate education opportunities, providing postgraduate degrees, in particular, to those people who want to learn the English language. We need to look very carefully at vocational training opportunities. In many parts of South East Asia, and particularly in Japan, it is the women in the society who are looking for professional qualifications. They are looking for a combination of both English language training and some form of training in secretarial studies or hospitality studies. We have the infrastructure through our TAFE system to provide that. It is an enormous potential export earner for Australia, and it is something which I have responsibility for developing on behalf of the Government. I will be talking with my colleagues in other portfolios about ways in which we might develop that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health is another important area. Legal services, green technology, financial services and telecommunications are others. The list is endless. The opportunities in Asia and in other parts of the world, including the Middle East, are absolutely endless. In the case of green technology, I heard the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), in his contribution in this debate earlier this afternoon, talking about Memtech, an organisation within his electorate which is doing some very important and impressive work in sewerage regeneration and so on. That is the sort of service development which we could clearly export to places like Thailand, which is looking at putting in major sewerage projects. As I say, we have the expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People tend to forget the enormous strengths that Australia has in respect of all of these services. We are exceptionally well educated and have a highly skilled work force. We have a sophisticated economy which is comparable in size to the whole of the ASEAN economies. That is something which is often overlooked. We have a highly efficient and competitive information and communications sector. We have a reputation for creativity and adaptability. We have a relatively healthy and clean environment and an open liberal democratic society. They are the sorts of things which in terms of services trade people believe are important. They are the sorts of strengths and attributes that position us well in the next century. They are the sorts of strengths that we need to build on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that one of the more significant issues that has come to the fore in recent times is financial services. A number of committees have been developed within Australia, particularly in New South Wales&mdash;the New South Wales Government is looking at this issue; there is a major conference on this issue in Sydney on the weekend of 18 and 19 October, if memory serves me correctly&mdash;to look at the promotion of regional headquarters for multinational companies wanting to locate in the Asia Pacific region. I see no reason why, for example, Australia should not be promoted in that respect. I see no reason why regional headquarters should not come to Australia rather than go to some of our Asian neighbours. Headquarters could be established here and Australians could be hired to work for them. Those people pay taxes. They contribute to economic wellbeing of this country. At the same time we are providing opportunities in the services sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also exporting the level of competency that we have in legal services, accountancy and a whole range of white-collar areas. This is because of our sophistication and the fact that English is the first language of this country, our legal system is something which is important, and our accountancy standards and so on can be applied equally in many other parts of the world as well as Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to build on those strengths further. What we should be doing is turning our backs on those doomsayers who are not prepared to speak up for Australia. We should be saying to them that this negative, unproductive criticism will simply obscure many of the success stories that are to be found in those that are in Asia at the moment, that are in the Middle East and that are in Europe. Far from having a disjointed trade policy, as the right honourable member for New England would have us believe in his contribution which was based on a great deal of fiction and very little fact, I would have to say that this Government is proud of its record in trade. It certainly has a clear definition of where it wants to go. I am sure that will be clearly enunciated in the coming months. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the estimates in relation to foreign affairs. I echo some of the issues that have been raised by previous speakers in this debate when I draw attention to the fact that the last five years have been a time of astounding change particularly in Europe but in other parts of the world as well. In Europe we have had the fixed assumptions and confrontations which have dominated that continent for more than four decades&mdash;all my life&mdash;abruptly overturned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have mentioned, two milestones stand out during the recent past. There can be very little doubt that Mikhail Gorbachev was the real catalyst for change in a way which many people did not expect. This change was directed at the USSR itself as well as at western Europe and it led ultimately to the collapse of communism and the collapse of the Iron Curtain. Some people have said it was the final curtain call. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second most important event was the signing of the historic Two-Plus-Four agreement in September 1990 which cleared the way for German unification at a rate which totally surprised most observers of the international scene. These events, momentous as they were in terms of revoking the Cold War, did not in themselves necessarily foreshadow an era of peace and stability for Europe. In fact, to the contrary, Europe has its own indigenous sources of conflict at present. We can all cite examples of deep-seated, national, ethnic, religious and political tensions which history shows us have plagued that continent for centuries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the demise of the Cold War, many of those historical animosities and pent-up frustrations have been released. Of particular concern to me is the bitter return to destructive nationalism in the Balkans and the worrying evidence of a resurgence of right wing sentiment in Germany. That latter development is of particular concern and I want to give it some attention during the rest of my contribution here. I also want to draw attention to the more unsettled nature of the world and its relationships as we see them today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that Australia could play its real part in contributing to a solution to some of the problems and, in so doing, enhance its reputation&mdash;which I believe it has&mdash;as a middle ranking power which has the capacity to be an honest broker. When one looks at Europe and analyses what is going on with the break-up of the USSR, without going into detail as to the various segments of the old USSR the newspapers as recently as today tell us of the very worrying developments in Georgia where we could have an escalation of violence between Georgian forces and Russian forces. We have the situation in the Ukraine where again there is a very real conflict and the potential for major conflagration. We have the situation that obtains in the newly emergent nations around central Asia with  real animosities, tensions and fire fights brought about by the rearrangement of boundaries, claims and counterclaims for historical territories, and the coming to the surface of long suppressed tensions of an ethnic and religious nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at what is happening in the Balkans at the present time to realise the potential for further disruption in that area of the world. The hope is of course that it will not involve more countries. We are seeing the break-up of Yugoslavia and the</PARA>
<PARA>horrific conflict between the Serbs and the Bosnians. And this quite dreadful concept of ethnic cleansing is one which makes all right-minded people shudder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is the potential for even more trouble in that part of the world. We have not at this stage seen the emergence, thank goodness, of a nationalism which may come about if the Macedonians sought to establish their historical boundaries. We would not be talking about Yugoslavia at that stage of course; we would be looking at conflicts involving at least three countries: the old Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria. There are a number of ethnic enclaves in Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary and we still have the problem of the Albanians within parts of the old Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these because what is occurring with this resurgence of nationalism, with this almost manic determination to bring about the dismemberment of countries which previously have been held under very severe communist rule, is a very human problem which could swamp western Europe. When we look at the problems in the old USSR and imagine the possible consequences of a major outbreak of fighting in various of those territories, or maybe more likely the effects of a very severe winter on food supplies, we see that there is the possibility of literally millions upon millions of people moving across the borders of central and eastern Europe towards western Europe. That is a potential problem which we can see developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we can see some of the manifestations of the response to the problem in what used to be East Germany. A very real animosity is being displayed towards people of different ethnic backgrounds, towards refugees and their succour in the old East Germany in a way which is of course exacerbated by difficult economic circumstances which are fairly unusual for the German people to confront, particularly former West German people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we did have a massive movement of people into central Europe from the old USSR and its satellites, the response of the Western world would be tested to the limit. The human response in the countries being peacefully invaded would be of potentially quite massive dimensions. I do not believe enough attention has been paid to these possibilities and what can be done about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only in central Europe that the rise of regionalism and nationalism is having its impact. We have on our very own doorstep the continuing problems of the situation in Bougainville with the Bougainville Revolutionary Army seeking to bring about a situation where it will have complete control of the island of Bougainville. The recent unfortunate pursuit of people across the border from Papua New Guinea into the Solomon Islands showed just how fragile the situation is in that part of the world. This is of more immediate concern to us, both from an international relations point of view and from a strategic point of view. It would seem to me that, again, the problems are being manifested through the wishes of people to have more control of their own destinies at a local level than was previously given them through the operations of central governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to somehow bring about a response to the quite obvious wishes of people to have more influence locally on the way they live their lives and the decisions that are made about them as against the disintegrative effects of such a policy should it lead to the breakdown of national unity in a country as diverse as Papua New Guinea. Again, I think it requires a very positive, careful and deep-thinking response from the Australian Government, a response which at this stage I have seen no real evidence in public terms it will come forward with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like a number of previous speakers, I would like to relate the experiences I have had in the last three weeks, having had the opportunity of visiting the AIPO conference in Indonesia, of going through Papua New Guinea and then on to Thailand for a bilateral meeting. It was very interesting to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), talk about Papua New Guinea, because it was one of the countries that I have never wished to visit. I accepted it as the direction of the delegation and can say that I was very pleasantly surprised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the opportunity as an Australian delegation to visit Papua New Guinea to assist with its celebration of independence. I felt nothing but warmth coming from its people. Papua New Guinea has had its independence now since 1975. Having regard to the strength with which it has developed that independence, I feel very proud of Australia's involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we can be very critical, I would ask those who would criticise the development of Papua New Guinea at this stage and where it is going to look back in Australia's history to 17 years after its Federation and see what we had achieved and where we had gone. I think we also have to take into account and acknowledge that Papua New Guinea in 1991 had experienced a record growth of some 9 per cent. In speaking with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, I understand that its 1992 Budget is certainly giving priority to law and order, health, education and, most importantly, infrastructure development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is high. In understanding why unemployment in a country such as Papua New Guinea is so high, the major area of employment is of course in the minerals and the energy sector. Even though that seems to be its engine room of growth, I found on further investigation that the sector directly employs no more than one per cent of the work force. On questioning that, I found it was because of the very intensive capital associated with mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years, Papua New Guinea, particularly the agricultural sector, has been plagued by very severely depressed prices. We had the opportunity of visiting a coffee plantation and seeing where Australian aid is assisting with the doubling, I suppose, of the supply of the plants and strains of coffee. I found it very interesting. I also found that in a country with a population of just on four million, and very widely dispersed, one of the biggest problems is that the people come from something like 700 different language groups. Some 85 per cent of the Papua New Guinea population still rely for their subsistence on farming, and 15 per cent are now coming into the urban areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found it very interesting in further investigating and talking with people that in 1975, when Papua New Guinea became independent, its foreign policy was based on universalism and `friends to all, enemies to none'. It has bilateral relations now with Australia. It has remained very close to and certainly has a very cooperative arrangement with Australia. In 1990-91, the total annual trade between our two countries was $1.35 billion. Papua New Guinea is now ranked eighteenth as a market for Australian exports. Australian aid to Papua New Guinea since 1975 has totalled some $4.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the people themselves and the cooperation and assistance which they provided to us as a delegation very pleasing. I would like to place on record&mdash;and I know it will be on record when the report is tabled&mdash;my sincere thanks and appreciation to all of the people involved. It also gave me an opportunity to acknowledge the expertise that is associated with our embassies in the three countries we visited. I pay great homage to Mr Allan Taylor, our excellent Ambassador, and his staff at the embassy in Papua New Guinea. I was particularly pleased to have had a very long conversation with the Hon. Albert Karo, the Deputy Leader and Minister for Works and Supply, and to learn how pleased he was with the working relationship that exists with the embassy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we went to Jakarta with the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation we had the opportunity to be briefed by Mr Phillip Flood in our embassy and to work very closely with his staff. They are not only achieving a great deal of cooperation with Indonesia but also putting Australia on the map there. I found it very interesting that trade in Indonesia has doubled in the last three years. The country went through an election in June under a system possibly a lot different to ours but, nevertheless, suited to it at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest pluses we will have is the development of our ASEAN neighbours. No matter what we say about Europe or where we are going in the future and what has happened in the past, my observation from these very short three weeks in those three countries&mdash;particularly travelling through Jakarta and Thailand&mdash;is that the twenty-first century will see the centre of gravity of the world economy in the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASEAN countries now have a combined population of over 300 million. In the past five years the annual average growth rate of GDP for ASEAN as a whole has been something like 6.9 per cent. If one investigates further, they certainly have an advantage over countries such as ours with their lower labour costs. I found that Indonesia's economy today has a strength and resilience which Indonesians should be very proud of. Australian exports to Indonesia were worth something like $1,449m in 1991, up 9 per cent on the figure in 1990. Australian imports from Indonesia were to a value of some $902m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relationship with Indonesia goes a little bit further than that. Many honourable members tonight in this debate have talked about where we are going with aid and what we are doing for the education of the different countries surrounding us. I believe that every student that is taught in Australia&mdash;and at the moment we have something like 6,500 students from Indonesia studying in Australia&mdash;becomes an ambassador for Australia. They go back to their country educated in our ways and in our ideas. They take back that expertise, from which the country then grows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found it very interesting that Western Australia and the Indonesian province of east Java signed a sister state/province relationship in 1990. Queensland signed a similar relationship with central Java in September 1991. In February 1992 the Northern Territory signed a memorandum of understanding designed to encourage economic development between the Northern Territory and the eastern part of Indonesia. When one looks at the very top of Australia and sees the closeness to a country such as Indonesia, it is interesting that people can get from one point to the other quicker than I can get from Sydney to Melbourne. The mandatory teaching of the Asian language in the Northern Territory and in some of our schools in Queensland is certainly a plus for the future development of united trade and the development of people in the two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is now the second largest recipient of aid from Australia after Papua New Guinea. It has a total transfer of something like $450m, which has occurred in the five years to 1990-91. Total development assistance to Indonesia from Australia was some $98m in 1989-90 and $108m in 1990-91. It is estimated at $115m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia is now one of the most popular non-English speaking destinations for Australian tourists. Something like 179,000 Australians visited Indonesia in 1990. The number of tourist visitors to Australia from Indonesia was around 37,000 in 1990. So we certainly have a lot going out in the tourist dollar and we need to cultivate a lot more coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the AIPO conference, Indonesia has developed an understanding of where its future lies. It is certainly prepared, following deregulation of its economy in 1986, to trade more extensively with us. Indonesia is very short on infrastructure, particularly water and power. Certainly it is encouraging the private sector to become more involved and to develop that infrastructure for it. This is opening up the way for Australia's industry and Australia's developers to move in there and become involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other event that I found very exciting during that tour was the bilateral visit with Bangkok. Again, I give honour to our Embassy and its staff, especially Mr John Phillip McCarthy and all his staff who had the opportunity of briefing us to ensure that our itinerary was very intensive. Our Embassy in Bangkok is the second largest after London for consultive work. It is now very multifaceted and, as the staff there have told us, it is the third largest embassy worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also looked at Thailand and found that it is now receiving the fourth largest aid from Australia after Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippines. Exports in 1992 were up 24 per cent, but from a very low base. We need more Australian investors to look at getting involved with Thailand. The Thai policy is also very crucial to what we all classify as the Cambodian problem. We need to talk a lot more and have that cooperation with the Thai Government and Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand is now the second wealthiest country in the Asian region. It will be a very keen player in the years to come. I found it very exciting to be there with a new government being elected. The Pro Democracy Party got there by a narrow majority. I congratulate all those members of Parliament and their future government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are currently talking about trade. We are all well aware that in the last 10 years this Government has presided over a massive debt blow-out that has gone up quite dramatically. What we have to do as a nation is to try to trade our way out of that situation. Unfortunately, instead of many of our firms which should be doing that trading with overseas countries getting on with that job, they are simply moving themselves overseas because of the adverse environment here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote very briefly from a recent newspaper article which shows up some of the cultural changes that are occurring in the established world. This article, from the journal of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Technology Review</EMPHASIS>, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . America's academic mainstream is, in uncharacteristic fashion, speaking out publicly that the economy is in serious structural trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Managers are receiving what the journal calls a `perverse signal': that it is cheaper to run a minimum wage operation than to invest in more productive technologies in the nation's factories and offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome is a trend destined to threaten the long-term economic growth of the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second factor eating away at the confidence of American industry watchers: the shift in the composition of the trade deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say US companies are losing out to foreign rivals, their competitive advantage in more and more areas of high technology. The most depressing thing about this is that it means losing skills. And that should ring a few bells here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout its history, the US has become accustomed to doing a lot of solid learning through its involvement in production. This `learning by doing' is considered to be the great strength of industrialised nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now US companies are starting to realise that when their overseas subsidiary is the one doing the manufacturing, the workforce at home loses out as the company's `doing' skills disappear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the directors often say, don't worry about that&mdash;just watch our bottom line improve. See how we're gaining market share out in the big wide world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But somewhere down the track, head office will discover the culture of the company has changed. It will have become the administrative arm of an overseas plant teaching some other nation's workers how to do things.</PARA>
<PARA>How near the bone that is for us in Australia. It seems to me that, in trade matters, we are not really grasping the opportunity presented by being on the edge of the world's fastest growing market&mdash;the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some success stories. We heard from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) a little earlier about a few success stories&mdash;obviously, one can pick a few here and there&mdash;but the basic point is that we do not have the policies to make it happen on a widespread or large scale. Like the previous speaker, I have also been overseas recently. I was in Korea and Malaysia, amongst other countries, where the governments there have been putting tremendous emphasis on providing industry with trained people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not really been doing that in this country. We say that we will do it, but the truth of the matter is that, last January, many thousands of qualified high school students simply could not get training places at university. There will be a repeat dose of that this coming Christmas. We know that, despite the Government knowing well in advance that the problem is there and that the numbers are coming up, many thousands will not be able to get places in university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of apprenticeships has evaporated in the last couple of years, yet we do not see the Budget measures to turn on the skills base and that tap of skills that we will need when we eventually come out of recession. Not many people in the working part of this country would agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the recession has finished. Most of them know damned well that in real life it is very much with us on a day to day basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My local TAFE college simply cannot meet demand and the Government response is totally inadequate in terms of dollars to help it try to meet that demand. In the last month I have had to recruit a new staff member. I ran a simple little advertisement in the local newspaper. I received 160 applications of which over 100 were from honours graduates. They had relevant qualifications, they were presentable, they were articulate and they were focused. But what is to happen to them? Where is the Budget plan to get those people into industry? How are we going to produce the apprentices and the TAFE trade places? Not only will our industry be handicapped in meeting the country's productive requirements when the upturn finally comes, but also our lack of trained people in the right area, compared with many other countries, will place an extra burden on our industry, which inhibits its ability to trade as successfully as it should and could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later when we talk about the estimates for the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, I will deal with the problems that industry suffers with taxation and industrial relations encumbrances. In this debate I want to talk a little about planning and infrastructure. In particular, I wish to draw the attention of the chamber to a little booklet that I picked up in Malaysia. It is a little booklet on investment in the manufacturing sector, policies, incentives and procedures. The booklet was published by the Malaysian Industry Development Authority. It is a little one-stop shop book for people who want to get into business. In this country people probably have to go to 54 shops and government agencies and so on if they want to get into business. This book covers it all. People can go along and get all their answers in one place. The booklet deals with manufacturing licences, guidance on foreign equity, incentives for investments, immigration and labour laws, exchange control, transfer of technology, facilities for investment and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Malaysia I had meetings with the Malaysian Industry Development Authority in Kuala Lumpur and it talked very extensively about the real help that it gives to businesses in planning and cutting the red tape and getting out of the road so that business can get on with making some money. We also visited some of the States. In Penang, for example, integrated within the overall plan they make sure that they make it easy for people to get into business. In this country the Government is doing nothing at all about making sure that we rationalise the myriad of State, Federal, local government and special interest-type encumbrances to people getting into business. I visited Ansell International, an Australian company which operates in Malacca, which has been well established for some years. There they have low tax costs, flexible as well as cheap labour, minimal red tape and speedy government decisions. People want to work; whereas in Australia it is all about rights and government handouts. This Government, I have to say, is doing very little to change those attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Malaysia is also sorting out its infrastructure. We do it at a snail's pace. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table: when are we going to see the third Sydney runway? How many years down the track is that runway? I inform the Parliamentary Secretary that the new airport in Kuala Lumpur will be ready for the next Commonwealth Games. They are not mucking around; they are getting on with it. Yet we have waited for 20-odd years and are going to wait for an awful long time yet.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure costs to business are not an impediment in Malaysia but they are in this country. I would be happy to pass on to the Government another little booklet which will tell it how to do things in terms of electricity, water, telecommunications, air cargo and all the rest of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line in terms of trade is simply that, while this Government procrastinates, Australian industry struggles to survive and cannot trade as it needs to overseas. Of course, some are doing okay. Last week I visited BHP Steel and found that it is doing quite well in terms of starting to create some export markets. But others are crushed by the high interest rates, the regulations and the high input costs which have been driven up by this Government. We need a radical change. Those on this side of the chamber have spelled out a plan in great detail&mdash;obviously in the Fightback plan&mdash;but we still await the substance of the Government's because at the moment all it is doing is fiddling around the edges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a couple of words about foreign affairs before I close. I am obviously going to be short of time but I particularly want to comment on the expenditure in this Budget on the new DFAT building. It does not take anybody with really good eyesight travelling around this country long to realise that we have massive amounts of spare office accommodation. Why we have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a new DFAT building is absolutely beyond my comprehension. Ten years of this Government has diminished Australia's standing in the world and in the region and this chamber should not approve of its policies or its Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this latish hour I wish to speak about a matter vital to our trade balance&mdash;namely, the management of the wool stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Woolgrowers in my electorate have been particularly hard hit in recent years through various factors such as high costs, which includes interest rates, low commodity prices and the drought which has decimated flocks, particularly in the western division of New South Wales. One factor that has been keeping these wool prices down is the stockpile. Even if that stockpile is not sold, it overhangs the market by its very presence and acts to stabilise prices at a low level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the open market began on 30 June last year there were 4.65 million bales in that stockpile and there was a debt of $2.718 billion owed by growers. That had been built up by spending $1.8 billion in reserves, the $1 billion tax that was collected during the purchase of that stockpile and borrowings after that. That amounted to an expenditure roughly equivalent to $100,000 per grower before the Wool Council suspended the reserve price sales. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> two tables which I will speak to in this debate. I have shown them to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) at the table. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MF4">Mr COBB</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Committee. Today we have four million bales left in the stockpile and a debt of $2.3 billion. From the beginning there has been a wide range of opinions as to what to do with the stockpile. Both individuals and groups within my electorate have suggested to me that we should dump it in the ocean, that we should give large amounts of it to ex-communist countries and worry about the payments later or that we should freeze the stockpile. I have heard every variation of those suggestions in between. However, most of the people I talk to about this matter are happy with the way the Wool Realisation Commission is handling the stockpile, even if they are unhappy with the price that their wool is receiving. The trade throughout the world is generally very supportive of what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt that growers owe is presently repaid from four sources: the 4 1/2 per cent tax on woolgrowers from the sale of wool; the $22.5m interest subsidy from the Federal Government, though that cuts out at the end of this year; the income that the AWC gets from various properties that it has; and the sales from the stockpile itself. In the first financial year the Realisation Commission sold 540,000 bales from the stockpile which realised $331m, an average of $614 a bale. The half a million bales that were sold saved growers $20m in storage costs. If they had to pay back what the wool realised plus the storage costs, it would have amounted on average to about $6,000 per grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a legislative requirement that the debt be paid off within seven years from 1 July last year, which means that if the stockpile covered the debt exactly we would have to be selling 14.3 per cent of the stockpile every year on average. If any surplus remains from stockpile sales through the price rising, this, quite rightly, would be returned to growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stockpile sales are administered by the AWRC. It has been selling bales of wool from the stockpile at a premium to the market price usually of 30c to 50c. So far this year it has only sold about 40,000 bales. We can compare that with the 82,000 bales it sold in the first week last year. The bales that it has sold this year amount to only 4.2 per cent of the total wool that has been sold, which is down on the 10.3 per cent that was sold last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With six selling seasons left, we must sell on average 670,000 bales from the stockpile from now on, although this is not a legislative requirement. It is obvious that if we are to keep up our average of sales in this financial year, we will have to start shifting a lot of wool after Christmas. Obviously, if we sell less wool this year we must make this up and sell more in future years and pay higher holding costs in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, at some stage sales must be stepped up very significantly from the present rate. It is in our interests to sell as many bales as we reasonably can early on to avoid flooding the market with a rush of wool in later years. That scenario would not only be detrimental to price and obviously would be anticipated by most buyers, but also it could disadvantage some early buyers who could be caught with uncompetitively priced stock. If possible, it is better to get ahead of the market with stockpile sales, as the AWRC has done in the first year, and keep the stockpile of wool coming onto the market on an annual basis. We must remember that wool that is not sold from the stockpile now only boosts the already high 670,000 average in later years, which will unduly depress future prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no easy way out at the present depressed prices until the stockpile is sold. There is a significant cost which many overlook in holding the stockpile&mdash;a cost which all growers must eventually pay. Admittedly, this has dropped markedly over the last year or so, but still amounts to interest of about $60 a bale on the 8 per cent interest that the AWRC is paying at the moment, with storage costs of about $7 to $8 a bale per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As something like 80 to 85 per cent of the stockpile is superdensity dumped and bales can be stacked up to seven high, the cost is much cheaper than it was. We also have other costs, such as administration, which amounts to about $2 to $3 a bale. The total cost of storage is about $70 to $71 a bale per year, which is presently running at about $280m a year, or something just under $4,700 per grower per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the depressing overhang the stockpile provides to market prices, there are significant cost advantages to growers of getting rid of it. It is interesting to note that the 4 1/2 per cent wool tax debt reduction levy raised $132m last year. Therefore, just to service the annual $280m costs of the remaining four million stockpile would be equivalent to a tax of about 9 1/2 per cent per year. I am not sure that most growers would support a 5 per cent tax increase to pay for freezing the stockpile, as some advocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freezing the stockpile would mean that an overhang of the market price would remain, and all the uncertainties that go with this which would largely cancel out any stimulus that the lesser volume of wool coming onto the market would have on price. It would also mean that the level of debt would increase as holding costs were added to the present debt.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool tax would have to increase. As I said, it would have to more than double. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also mean, very importantly, I believe, that certain sales that we are making now would be lost permanently because of two factors. Firstly, there is a shortfall in particular types of wool coming onto the market from this year's shorn wool that can only be serviced from the stockpile. For example, there is at present a strong demand for cardings and skirtings for the knitwear industry. Secondly, there is some wool that from time to time needs to be immediately sourced by mills directly from overseas stockpile holdings.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we freeze the stockpile, that wool could not be sold and that would be a loss to the trade which would probably go to the synthetic or cotton industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, those are some of the considerations that have to be taken into account in deciding what to do with the stockpile. There is a balance between differing opinions and competing interests. Whatever course of action is taken will not please everyone. Many are saying that the wool industry at the moment is lacking in strong leadership, and perhaps there is some truth in that. There certainly has been in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly believe that there is a lack of facts and information for the growers and that is denying them the right to contribute to the debate in a fully informed manner. I believe that there should be information coming through to growers now on how to operate futures, options and mechanisms such as this. When that stockpile eventually does come down and more volatility comes into the market, the growers will suddenly be faced with the need to use these mechanisms. Many of the growers, myself included, are largely ignorant as to how to operate them now. I think that is a job for the industry and the farmer organisations. In conclusion I say that, while the short term outlook for the wool industry is quite difficult in many areas, I am nevertheless confident that further on down the track the wool industry will have a solid and secure future, as it has for the past 150 years. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it would be better if the honourable member went back to the trough. I wish to address tonight the estimates of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce. This Department, in all, uses nigh on $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money. It did last year and it will in the year to come. In a business sense, I suppose one could say that the Government takes from business in Australia about $35 billion in business tax, company tax, payroll tax, wholesale sales tax, customs duties and the rest. It gives back in a scatter shot of measures an amount of between $2 to $2 1/2 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this Government calls that industry policy, we have a different view. We will leave at least the initial incidence of that tax with industry so that more than half of the business tax will be left for its initial use. Although much of that money will devolve to the purchases of goods, it will change things radically in this country to the great benefit of business and its customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of programs in this portfolio. In the short time allotted to me tonight, I wish to mention only two. One is nothing less than a tragedy; and that is the Australian Industry Development Corporation. One cannot fail to note that it managed to lose about $100m last year and its current liabilities stand at $2.9 billion. It is an interesting loss compared with some of the more elaborate company losses in the medium company size bracket at least in the last year or two. I noticed only yesterday that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was boasting about his management of the Commonwealth Bank and how he did not think it was much chop that these managers of other banks could not manage their affairs as well as he had managed the affairs of the Commonwealth Bank. I am sure he was referring to his confreres in Victoria, after the disaster of the State Bank in Victoria and the State Bank in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, when that same Prime Minister was Treasurer a few years ago, he was rather scathing about the AIDC. He made some almost scurrilous remarks about that institution. Back in 1988 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we've got a better solution, we'll regulate a bit of it off you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he was using the English language to its best effect&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and send it down to the AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why should the funds of superannuation members, who are mostly just workers, be put across to some genius so-called in the AIDC to invest it for him . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do you think that every investment manager out there in the AMP Society or National Mutual or the other 300,000 funds is? A lemon? . . . the funds can only be invested wisely by someone at the AIDC, which is just a Government merchant bank?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, it's a government merchant bank which has conned two-thirds of the party . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Only three or four years before the Government had been quite scathing about the thought of privatising an institution such as the AIDC, and the present Prime Minister was one of the first Ministers in this Government who understood that these sorts of institutions could get out of hand. But he did not do anything at all about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little later on, Senator Evans was one of the first of the Government Ministers who perhaps put it a little more accurately again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My heart, like those in the Labor Party, continues to tug in the direction of public ownership, but my head tells me that if we sweep privatisation off the table, we may be condemning some of these enterprises to death&mdash;either instant or by slow strangulation.</PARA>
<PARA>His was a rather revealing and rather more sensible appraisal than many in the Labor Party were at that time giving it. But there were two senior members of the Government who understood, albeit belatedly, that these sorts of institutions in the end fall down either by the weight of their own incompetence or, more usually, by the lack of incentive that is inherent in those governmental organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now we have an institution which in the last two years, by my reckoning, has probably lost well over $130m. But, like everything else, this Government has come to this conclusion too late. Can we privatise this institution at this stage? We could have three or four years ago when the market was a little more buoyant. But now we will be faced with the problem of what to do with an institution that sadly, like many other companies in this country, has come to the end of a difficult time under this Government, which is very difficult to privatise and very difficult to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise just one other subject&mdash;the Anti-Dumping Authority, which last year had total running costs of about $1.23m. That is very commendable as it was down on the estimate by about $100,000. The Australian Customs Service, of course, utilises $1.2 billion and has a lot of people working for it. The Anti-Dumping Authority last year commenced 93 inquiries on 34 products. It completed 80 inquiries, of which some 37 were instigated the year before, and it had 15 positive findings and 15 negative findings. I notice that the estimates for next year are up about $300,000 to $1.56m. That means that there is an expectation in the Department of a greater influx of dumped or subsidised products, or perhaps a little more utilisation of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well there might be that expectation, because if we are to bring down protection&mdash;as this Government is doing just about right across the board, and would have done until it took a political view on several industries only a few months ago&mdash;we will come quite reasonably to the conclusion that we must provide a mechanism for those products that are coming in either subsidised in their making or subsidised in their export or, alternatively, coming in having been dumped&mdash;in other words, coming in at a price that is less than that in the country of origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot for the life of me understand why after great deliberation this Minister has managed to cut only 10 days off the time for an anti-dumping or countervailing duty inquiry and why he has left the material injury test too harsh. We certainly will take cognisance of the fact that if the Government is bringing down protection, it must provide mechanisms by which those hearing times can be shortened and by which the material injury test can be made reasonable rather than, as most of industry in this country thinks right now, eminently unreasonable. We will do that by bringing the time for establishing a case to answer to five days, the preliminary hearing to 60 days, and the final hearing to 90 days&mdash;a total of 155 days, which will shorten the Government's elongated process by about 100 days, and that will be not before time. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available to me in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I intend to confine my remarks primarily to the industrial relations aspects of the Bill. Industrial relations is a key area of government policy. Good industrial relations is central to the process of economic reform under way in this country and the restructure of our industry. Good industrial relations is also central to maintaining high living standards for the men and women of Australia and ensuring that their quality of life is enhanced in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the life of this Government, the Labor Party has achieved substantial gains in these fields. In those areas often measured as the litmus test of industrial relations policy, this Government's record is a proud one. The Government has achieved record low levels of industrial disputation during its term in office. That has continued throughout the period from 1983. It stands in stark contrast to the industrial disputation levels of the period from 1976 to 1983, when those opposite were on the government benches. The difference is not slight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial disputation now is running at about one-third the level it did during the period in which the Opposition was in government. The recipe for disaster in the Opposition's industrial relations policy for the future would return Australia to that period of confrontation, pitting Australian against Australian and throwing out the baby with the bath water, ignoring the benefits that have developed in this country, particularly in the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, through its industrial relations policy, has promoted and fostered collective bargaining, which has facilitated workplace reform and industry reform. That has been done without recourse to bludgeoning the work force. It has been done without recourse to reducing wages. There are no $3 youth wage proposals. There are no threats of sending the troops into the wharves. This has been done through a recognition by all those involved in enterprise&mdash;management and employees, and their various representatives&mdash;that together they have the capacity to build a stronger enterprise and a more equitable one: a more socially just operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proof of the pudding&mdash;the success of those changes&mdash;can be seen in a number of ways. It can be seen in the increases that have occurred in a number of sectors of our economy which previously had been uncompetitive and had been poor performers by world standards. There has been a dramatic increase, for example, in the production and export of elaborately transformed manufactures in our country in the last three years. The statistics on that have been mentioned on a number of occasions in this place. It could not have been done without the workplace reform which has been part and parcel of the industrial relations program of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An area that is often referred to in the context of the process of reform is the waterfront. It staggers me that those opposite continue to go around the country talking of the Australian waterfront as an area in which there has been no reform, an area which is still bedded in the 1950s or the 1960s. It was nearly a year ago, on 31 October 1991, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried an article by Peter Roberts in which he referred to the improvements which have occurred on the waterfront. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>which is in Melbourne&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is achieving an average of 22.</PARA>
<PARA>That was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a year ago. Since then there have been other improvements on the waterfront. Yet those opposite continue to peddle the story that there has been no real reform and Australia still lags behind. Let us look at the international comparison, which was given in the same article. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following per-crane-hour figures compare the rate of lifting containers for medium-sized cellular container vessels at comparable ports:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port Melbourne 22.0; Felixtowe 19.7; Hamburg 27.4; Braemer Haven 21.0; Zeebrugge 19.5. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The performance in handling containers in Melbourne a year ago compared more than favourably with comparable ports throughout Europe. That fact is known to those opposite, yet they continue to ignore it for their political purposes as part of their campaign in seeking to destroy the cooperation and the structures which have been established in industrial relations by this Government, by the trade union movement and by the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is driven by a fundamentalist economic view which takes no heed of personal desires and takes no heed of the opportunities that are available now for people jointly, through their trade union, before an industrial commission and in direct negotiations with individual employers, to set about improving workplace arrangements in a way that provides a safety net that is just for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we try to look at the Opposition's policies in these areas it becomes a little difficult. We all await their birth after a long gestation period. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has been carrying this baby around since July last year when he set forth what was to be his policy in an article that makes good reading, I must say. He is credited with having penned it himself. It appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Current Affairs Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of June 1991. This policy has had a long gestation period that has ebbed and flowed through various processes and suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1991 a reasonably comprehensive article which he had penned set out in some detail the blueprint. It seemed to ebb and flow a little from then on. In December last year he told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> program that it was not a blueprint he would be announcing; it was the Act. He said that the Australian people would be able to see the legislation he would introduce as a matter of great priority were he to have the opportunity. He said on that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in December 1991 that the Bill would be introduced `well before the next election'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By February of this year and again in March the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) confirmed that the Bill would be released before the election. By the end of June the honourable member for Bennelong told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> that he `had not decided to release the Bill before the election'. There had obviously been a change of attitude on the part of the honourable member for Bennelong in the course of this long gestation period. He went on to say that he was `not making any promises about releasing a bill'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, in August, on radio 2GB in Sydney he told the compere of a radio program that the coalition's industrial relations policy had been released. So we have had another change of events in the gestation of this great birth we are to witness later this month. He said the coalition has had a clear position on these things since 1986. That is something which may be clear to the honourable member for Bennelong, but it is not clear to the Australian people and it is certainly not clear to most observers in this place either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still think the most lucid effort of the honourable member for Bennelong at putting down his blueprint, short of his Bill, was his article of June of last year in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Current Affairs Bulletin</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just assure him that, although I am always interested in what happens across the Tasman Sea, I must correct any notion that in some way the industrial relations policy which he is substantially already aware of, and which will be released in its up-to-date detail on 20 October by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and myself in Sydney, owes really anything to what has taken place in New Zealand, although I do not in any way criticise what has occurred in New Zealand. I am bound to observe that, as every day goes by, the productivity gains that are being won under the industrial relations policy which has been in force in New Zealand since the change of government in that country, are giving the lie to the argument peddled by the Labor Party in Victoria and nationally that the advent of that new industrial relations era in New Zealand has spelt doom and destruction for individual New Zealand workers. The fact is that it is working very well. It is delivering productivity improvements and it is starting to make a large number of Australian companies sit up and take notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fascinated&mdash;as no doubt other observers of the scene would have been&mdash;by the total preoccupation of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) today at Question Time.

I was so impressed that I am going to send him an invitation to come on 20 October. He can even be our guest and be there on the tick of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and myself, because he is obviously so totally preoccupied with the industrial relations policy of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that a very big debate has been going on about industrial relations in Australia now for a number of years. There has been an enormous sea change. I do not pretend that every union in Australia has behaved in a totally bloody-minded fashion over that period, and I have frequently said that there are a number of trade union leaders in Australia over the last few years who have demonstrated a concern for the long term national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is not so much about the objective. We surely all have in common the objective of a more productive Australian nation, more competitive Australian industries and an Australian work force and a group of Australian employers who are far more united than they have ever been in the past about the need to achieve higher productivity outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the debate is surely about how best to achieve that. It is our very strong view that we will never achieve that objective in a full-blooded sense without taking away the roadblocks which exist under the present system. The great roadblock is of course the great sticking point of the Labor Party: it can never let go of the system. It can never say to the work force of Australia, `We trust you to make decisions that you are satisfied are in your interests without our having a look over your shoulder and decide whether or not they ought to receive a tick'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what motivated Anna Booth when she went to Queensland a few days ago. She went to those employees of the Gazal company on the Gold Coast and said, `Well, I don't really care what you have decided is in your best interests. I, Anna Booth, reserve to myself the right to superimpose my view of what is in your best interests over and above your own mature, adult judgment of what is in your interests'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government asks us to accept that we are living in a modern, contemporary industrial relations climate when it has that kind of old-fashioned paternalism or maternalism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the end of the farce. Not only did she traipse up to Queensland and say, `You can't do this', but also she was followed in solemn procession by the Industrial Relations Commission. There they were in full view of the television cameras. They actually went to the premises and in earnest tones and grave listened to what had to be said. They no doubt repaired to Melbourne and will hand down a tablet from the mountain.

The reality, of course, is that they are a lot smarter than the Government thinks they are. On this subject they are a lot smarter than the Government for years has imagined them to be. That is why, when the full extent of the choice that is available on this subject is made known to the Australian people, my advice to the Government is not to try to win the next election campaign on industrial relations. It will be beaten to smithereens on the subject of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is on a loser with industrial relations because the tide of Australian history is against it. The great majority of Australian workers are fed up with the monopolistic practices of Australian unions. The young and women cannot abide unions, and the Government knows that. The archetypal unionist in Australia now is a middle-aged male. The Government is way out of court when it comes to the attitude of Australian workers towards trade unions in this country. I can only hope that the Government tries to fight the next election substantially on the issue of trade union domination and trade union power because I reckon it will be a killing field electorally so far as the Government is concerned. This is an idea whose time has come. The Australian public is a wake-up to being told that they are too stupid to decide what is good for them. I can only hope that the Government continues to display, as its Prime Minister did today, the supreme sensitivity about what we say on the subject of industrial relations. It cheers me no end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, I come in here night after night and it is very rare that I get the opportunity to speak on the adjournment debate. I am very grateful to you, sir. Back in April of this year, the Streatham Action Group released a paper which it called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> 1/2 As Likely</EMPHASIS>. It related to the penalty costs of a tertiary education for rural students. I know that there are a number of members in the House tonight on both sides who will know exactly what I am talking about. I will selectively read from that report tonight. The synopsis states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This study confirms what common sense suggests. Simply put, tertiary students who must leave their farms or country urban centre homes to attend higher education institutions unavoidably incur substantial costs additional to those of students who may remain at home while studying. The current arrangements impose a penalty for participation on tertiary students from rural areas. The penalty and deterrent have been publicly acknowledged by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. It is a clear case of social injustice. It could and should be promptly redressed by targeted changes to the Austudy provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading, `The Penalty Costs of Tertiary Education for Rural Students', the introduction states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Streatham Action Group and the Victorian Farmers Federation Social Issues Committee have been concerned about the low participation rate of country students in tertiary education and the impact of the current rural recession on participation rates. A particular concern is the cost disadvantage of students who must live away from home to attend a higher education institution. Both groups have made submissions to the Chapman Review of Austudy and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The submissions noted the lack of data in respect of unavoidable additional costs incurred by country students living away from home. The Streatham Action Group decided to carry out a survey of costs incurred by a sample of students in calendar year 1991. This report details these costs and discusses their implications.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 NBEET report notes that rural people participate at half the rate of their metropolitan counterparts in tertiary and further education. There are a number of cultural and demographic reasons for this fact, but by far the most important is `locational disadvantage' and consequent financial disadvantage. The hidden cost of supporting a rural student at a considerable distance from home include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">travel</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">telephone contact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduced access to part time employment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">loss of economies in shared family resources</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.loss of family/home support in transition from dependence to independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is that some eligible students do not take up tertiary studies. Those who do, and/or their families, incur a penalty cost. The above reports were based on information collected over the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no avoiding the fact that country students are at an enormous disadvantage. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know this yourself. They always have been and they will continue to be unless something dramatic is done about it. The recommendations from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> 1/2 As Likely</EMPHASIS> report from the Streatham Action Group are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That DEET establish a living away from home allowance for students who have no choice but to live away from home to gain a tertiary education. This allowance should have the following characteristics:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">income but not asset tested</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-calculations for eligibility to include the number of dependent students in a family</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">-the amount should accurately reflect both the establishment and recurrent costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That DEET capital programs for regional tertiary institutions be used to expand rapidly the available on-campus accommodation at these institutions as this is the most economical living away from home accommodation for rural students.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two more recommendations but time is running out. I congratulate the Streatham Action Group. These people are farmers and have hands-on experience. I congratulate the Ballarat University College, which has been actively involved, and in particular Dr Frank Hurley, Ms Gayle Richards from his office and Mr Peter Forster who assisted in the analysis of the survey. A large number of people have had input into this report including the Victorian Farmers Federation. Denise Dumesny from the country education project was again of enormous assistance. They have identified the problems. I thank them very much for the input they have put into this very important question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to do something that is possibly very strange for a member of parliament; that is, to pay credit and to praise a particular reporter of the daily <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mirror</EMPHASIS> for her article that she wrote on Friday, 2 October 1992. That reporter was Patricia Wilson. The article I refer to is entitled `Tranquillity and hope at a school with a myriad of accents: A way with words'. This reporter took the time, effort and trouble to come out and visit a high school within my electorate, Fairfield High School, which has about 1,400 students and over 1,000 of those come from foreign countries. In other words, 80 per cent of that school are nationalities other than Australian. I am very pleased that for once we had a reporter who truly appreciated how a combination of multi groups like that can, with the dedication and hard work of teachers, make such a beautiful school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the Parliament that I have the five largest high schools in New South Wales in my electorate. We have Westfield Sports High School, which is very multicultural and has excellence in sport; we have St Johns Park High School, where one of the students was chosen from Australia-wide to come down here to Canberra to study political systems; we have Prairiewood High School with 1,500 kids and which has excellence in languages; we have our Patrician Brothers High School; and the Mary McKillop College. In other words, we have many schools of a character similar to Fairfield High School. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article was very pleasing because too often, particularly in the western region of Sydney, we see reporters without understanding or appreciating the composition of the population and without understanding and appreciating the kids that make up that community write in such derogatory tones. This article is sincere; it is well researched; it is well understood; and it is certainly from a writer who appreciated her visit to the particular electorate. Time and time again I have said to people who want to come out to our area, `You are more than welcome. Come and see for yourself. Don't ask anyone. Don't tell anyone; just come. You can see how your ideas of how our community is made up will change. You will also appreciate the dedication and hard work that goes into bringing what I have always regarded as united nations together and how it works in harmony'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often we hear the ugly word `racism'. It is not in that community; it is brought into that community by people who do not appreciate and who write in ignorance. I will pass this article around my community. I know that this article was appreciated by all students who attend that school and their parents. They also appreciated the fact that she spoke to a number of those students and realised that a lot of them came from backgrounds in refugee camps, where they were single people without family assistance, support and help and yet they strove for education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was also very heart-rending when she wrote at the very end of it that she came with a group of 12, all from different countries, and that 10 weeks before she arrived to see them they could not speak a word of English. Yet when she was there on that Friday they gave a rendition of a song that John Lennon, a former Beatle, was renowned for. They sang in English, `You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one; I hope some day you'll join us, and the world will be as one'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what my electorate is about. That is the message we try to get out through our teaching systems, to our communities and the electorate at large. It is really what multiculturalism is all about. It is really what our Government's policy is with multiculturalism&mdash;in other words, encouraging that intermix, most particularly providing the facilities in which those kids can be educated properly and breaking down the barriers which they have fled from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see more articles like this, perhaps not only in my community but through other electorates throughout Australia. Then perhaps we will not be always condemning what we have not got; we will stand for once and be counted and appreciate what we do have. Let us for once look at that. This reporter has done it. This reporter has acknowledged what we have in that school and I hope that many reporters in the future will also acknowledge the wealth of the communities at large that make up this country of Australia, particularly the wealth of the ethnic people who come and make Australia their home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week in my electorate, in the town of Kingaroy, a major buy Aussie campaign is being launched. The campaign is being promoted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">South Burnett Times</EMPHASIS>. I would like particularly to compliment the newspaper's editor, John Cameron, the managing director, Doug Collyer, and all those who have been associated with getting the campaign going. The campaign has been supported by the farm organisations of the region and, indeed, the whole community. It is important for Australians to recognise that they can contribute towards their national productivity by buying Australian products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was particularly good also to read during the week that Australia's largest retailing groups are identifying Australian made and Australian grown products on their supermarket shelves. Coles and Woolworths, who have a very large proportion of the market between them, are both promoting locally produced merchandise during October as part of an Australian made month. In addition, the South Australian retailer Foodland has decided to trial a new product labelling code designed to identify local products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see that Australia's major retailers are at last prepared to cooperate with campaigns to support Australian made products. A recent survey by Coles revealed that 60 per cent of shoppers were prepared to pay a 10 per cent premium on items made in this country and nearly 70 per cent said they would purchase Australian produce even if the quality of the imported goods was slightly better. Many busy shoppers cannot afford the time to search for often minute labels identifying the country of origin of the various products on the supermarket shelf. The efforts of the major retailers to clearly identify Australian goods will help their customers, but also draw attention to the importance to the Australian economy of buying locally. Woolworths intends to place little Australian flags on goods that are Australian produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shoppers who buy foreign made goods contribute just as surely to our country's national debt as do the high flying entrepreneurs or overspending governments. Coles intends to use a slogan `Buy Australian, and buy your kids a job'. This slogan really puts the case for purchasing Australian goods clearly and succinctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could also be said that buying Australian is the only guarantee of buying quality. All Australian food producers are required to meet rigid health and quality standards. However, despite a dramatic increase in the range and quality of imported foods, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has only seven inspectors to look at imported food and they are authorised to look at only 17 different items. For example, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples)&mdash;I note that he is at the table&mdash;was quoted recently as acknowledging that, while Australian canned tomatoes must be presented in welded cans to prevent lead leaching out of the solder, soldered imported cans can still come in. It is a national disgrace that food and other products that would be condemned if they were made in this country are allowed to be imported and sold to Australian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next important issue is that of the proper labelling of all products to ensure that the country of origin is clearly known. Labelling laws are, of course, largely a State responsibility, and it is only recently that the State governments have agreed, through the National Food Authority, to standardise their rules. Since January, citrus juice must be labelled as imported or with the country of origin. The States have also agreed that loose fruits, nuts, fish and vegetables must have a sign at the point of sale advising whether they are imported. This became law at the end of February. But how many signs are actually displayed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has imports of more than $1m of pig meat every month, but because meat is not included on the list, sellers do not have to tell their customers that the ham they are buying was previously frozen pig meat from Canada. The National Food Authority is a good start, but it has a long way to go to ensure that products are properly labelled and that Australian consumers are told the truth about the country of origin of the products that they buy. The major supermarkets are to be congratulated on their moves to identify Australian made products, but with all the best will in the world they will have difficulty with the state of Australia's existing regulatory arrangements in identifying products which are really Australian. The power of consumer pressure can succeed in revitalising Australian industry, even where governments have been slow or unwilling to act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came in tonight to defend Comcar, because I thought that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), for whom I have a very high regard, was very unfair in his criticism last night. In my view, Comcar is probably the best of services that are available to politicians, and anyone who uses the service would know that Comcar drivers are more efficient, more discreet, and more thorough than any taxi company or hire car company.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is wrong to levy this charge on Comcar, as it is wrong in the present situation where we have DAS renting the cars to Comcar and reaping the benefit of the resale that does not accrue to Comcar. I urge the Government to have a decent and fair look at Comcar and put it on a sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few words to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I think the honourable member is without a doubt the best intellect on the other side. He is head and shoulders above anyone else that the Liberal Party can offer. Unfortunately, he is fairly lonely. But like a lot of people, the honourable member for Bennelong has a hang-up about industrial relations. I have the advantage over the honourable member for Bennelong and, I might add, over many of the left wing unionists I have to deal with. I have actually worked in the workplace. I have actually had to be down there and have found out what it is like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member to come in here and suggest that workers are in a position to negotiate equally with their employer is absolute nonsense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any politician who tells people that there will be full employment in this country without a manufacturing industry is lying&mdash;either lying or stupid. Clearly it will not happen under Liberal Party policies. But if we address ourselves there are so many areas where we are very competitive in industry. We lack the incentives that are applied elsewhere. The problem is not taxation. It was never the problem in Australia. The problem was always a lack of a sensible industry policy. Until governments achieve this, we will not have employment for our kids. I believe that with an application to a genuine industry policy, import replacement will be the future for employment for a lot of our kids. It is through this area that we can make the products that will find niche markets in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), just say that shoppers were as responsible as the big spenders for the current account deficit. That is patently absurd; it is absolute nonsense. I do not deny that we should be buying Australian. The honourable member highlighted some very useful stuff. I think, if we look at the record of AQIS in Australia over recent years, we can see how it has put lead in the saddle bags that Australia carries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to have a commitment to a level playing field, yet on our side of the House we have had people dedicated to that level playing field.

Let us get things in a realistic fashion. Let us look at what the world does, not what these other people in the world do, all of whom have made their great economic successes by practising protection. We can look at them and run through them. Germany, the United States and Japan, all had very heavily protected industries. These are the people who lecture and hector us about the level playing field. It is about time we started having some nationalistic thoughts, thoughts of putting Australia first.

Mr Rupert Murdoch, a US citizen is the Chairman and Chief Executive of News Corp which was, at the time, owned as to around 43 per cent by Mr Murdoch and his Australian resident family and associates. At the time of the acquisition the largest shareholder in Independent Newspapers Ltd was News Ltd, a subsidiary of News Corp.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act includes provisions enabling the Family Court to issue a warrant to police to take possession of a child and deliver the child to the person entitled to access. In addition the person entitled to access can apply to the Court to have any person who fails to comply with an access order dealt with by the Court. The Act provides a range of legal sanctions which the Family Court may impose on the person who fails to comply with the access order. These sanctions include orders for non-custodial parent to be given compensatory access time, fines against the custodial parent, and orders that the custodial parent serve periods of community service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Family Court, in dealing with failure to comply with access orders, places emphasis on the use of its counselling facilities. The Court takes the view that counselling should be ordered well before the situation develops where orders are sought for non-compliance. There is an emphasis on early intervention counselling. In the event that a matter has reached the stage that an order is sought for non-compliance, the case is referred to the counselling service of the court. The counselling service has tested intervention programs for families which have high conflict access problems. </PARA>
