<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, the Lord of Knight's of the Sovereign World Order of the White Cross, Dr Paul Baron Neuman of Kara Bagh as President of the Confederation of Chivalry jointly with our Officers and Members in Australia and worldwide, and citizens and residents of the Commonwealth of Australia in participation with the aims of our Orders of the Humanitarian Knighthood for the protection and defence of life by this our humble petition respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We jointly wish to voice our concern and objection on behalf of the undersigned petitioners, about the human rights violations in the neighbourhood and sphere of interest to the Continent of Australia, namely the territory known as East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, now under the occupation and suppression of the Republic of Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The undersigned petitioners sincerely believe that the brutal occupation of the East Timorese territories, being the sole and sovereign property of the rightful inhabitants, and therefore by International Law and by Divine Right the holders of this sovereignty which has been brutally ended by the Indonesian invasion with a massive support and consent of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, very much in contrast to the Charter of the United Nations. We would consider it safe to say that the Australian Government's ventures in this matter were highly aimed towards self-interest, particularly in the acquisition of oil drilling rights, a pact, which has led to the deaths of many thousands being killed in the guerilla war, probably up to a quarter of a million people over the years of occupation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hold that a Government must maintain a certain criteria of principles and a certain amount of trustworthy substance before the eyes of the world and the international community at large. Yet under the leadership of the then Prime Minister, the Honourable Robert Hawke such principles failed to rule, since he was very much prepared to send Australian warships, even without the consent of Parliament, into the Gulf War, defending a "small nation (Kuwait)" against an aggressor (Saddam Hussein's armed forces), pretending same to be in the name of Human Rights and Justice. Saying in fact that a powerful aggressor will not get away with by falling upon a small nation. The same Labour Government under the same Prime Minister, the Hon. Robert Hawke, were the Australian Originators of a Pact with the Republic of Indonesia, an event neglected by the Media on purpose, but finely exposed itself before an astonished world witnessing the Dili massacre, while the same Government of the Commonwealth of Australia did not come to the aid of a small nation to defend such peoples against a powerful aggressor (Indonesia). On the contrary, under the "able management" of a Foreign Minister, the Honourable Senator Gareth Evans, Indonesia had been well equipped with weaponry and military expertise to carry out the onslaught upon a defenceless small nation, neighbouring Australia across the Strait of Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hold that it would be naive to assume that the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was acting in good faith for the good of all people and mankind, not foreseeing the consequences and outright murder which had followed the signing of this historical oil pact. We would consider this kind of foreign policy counter productive to peace and goodwill, a farce, to say the least and similar to the act of the Honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs who some weeks ago kissed the leader of the murderous Pol Pot on both cheeks, which must be seen being a mockery to the millions that died under the brutal rule of the same Pol Pot Leader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We further hold that Australians as people are kind and good natured who would in principle, seek peace and mateship with all its neighbours in the Pacific, yet being misled in their trust by a socialist party following a policy which could, as we fear, put this very Commonwealth of Australia before the International Court of Justice and to the judgment of the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament of Australia surrenders its support for further occupation of East Timor and grant its consent to the establishment of full sovereignty of the people of the said East Timor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the twentieth century there have been a series of revolutions in technology. The Industrial Revolution, which started in nineteenth century England, appears to have accelerated in pace ever since. The techniques of industrial production have been transformed. Assembly lines are now manned by robots and produce consumer goods which could hardly have been imagined a century ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be no exaggeration to say that a new phase in this revolution is about to commence. Genetic engineering will enable the productive potential of living organisms to be expanded and given direction to an extent never before possible. The use of living organisms to produce food and clothing and the extraction of drugs from plants is, of course, older than recorded history. The selective breeding of plant and animal strains goes back almost as far. But increased knowledge of genetics, and in particular of the nature of the DNA molecule and how to manipulate it, has greatly enhanced our power to control basic biological processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible applications of these new biological techniques are extremely broad. There is the potential to improve the production efficiency of plant and animal species. Increased resistance to pests and diseases may be programmed into the genetic code with greater precision than the rather hit-and-miss methods of traditional selective breeding. This may reduce the need for environmentally hazardous fertilisers and pesticides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quality of the products derived from plants and animals may be improved. For example, it may be possible to develop crops which keep for longer periods when harvested. It may also be possible to reduce wastage and therefore allow more product for feeding people. The use of specially developed micro-organisms for bulk production of pharmaceuticals and agricultural and veterinary chemicals will have tremendous commercial significance. In many cases such production methods will not only lower production costs but will lead to products of greater purity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may also be aware of the work which the CSIRO is currently carrying out using genetic manipulation techniques to find a means of reducing the fertility of foxes and rabbits which cause so much damage to the Australian environment. There will be important benefits for human health from the use of genetic manipulation. The mechanisms by which all living organisms function will be opened up to much greater examination. This knowledge will undoubtedly assist in the treatment of those who suffer from diseases caused by some genetic deficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chief Executive of the CSIRO, Dr John Stocker, recently announced a breakthrough with gene shears. He revealed that a new improved form of this technology had been developed which could destroy&mdash;although at the moment only in a test tube&mdash;the HIV virus which causes AIDS. The possible importance of such a discovery hardly needs to be pointed out to the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are concerned with the introduction of this new technology, however. The fact that it involves direct manipulation of the genetic code of living organisms understandably arouses doubts and fears. The Committee's report examines in detail the various kinds of concerns that have been raised. Many people are concerned about possible environmental damage from released plants, animals or micro-organisms which have been the subject of genetic changes. Others have deeply held ethical objections or are concerned about the possible social changes which might flow from the introduction of such technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Genetic manipulation techniques provide a very powerful tool. Any powerful tool requires careful handling, and this is certainly the case with the ability to manipulate inherited characteristics. Obviously, the risks involved will depend on the nature of the genetic changes made and how competently the risks are analysed before any release is authorised. It is only on that case by case basis that the dangers, if any, can be identified and a risk assessment can be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call for a blanket ban on all genetic manipulation or all releases is unjustified when the dangers and the possibilities of any particular undesirable event happening are so widespread and variable. It is unrealistic to demand absolute certainty about safety when we live in a world where absolute certainty is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has made recommendations about the various means which could be employed to increase the safety in releasing GMOs. The possibility of limiting the potential of micro-organisms to transfer altered or added genes to non-target organisms should be thoroughly researched. The use of so-called suicide genes, gene promoters and marker genes should also be considered. In all cases those proposing releases should be required to put forward worst case scenarios to help ensure full consideration of possible dangers and the level of risk involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding of basic environmental research should be encouraged so that a risk assessment does not proceed without adequate knowledge. In addition, monitoring of effluent from laboratories and factories where GMOs are used should be required to ensure that unauthorised releases do not take place. There are already fairly comprehensive guidelines concerning the use of genetic manipulation in contained work and procedures to be followed before any release takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee which enforces these rules, known as GMAC, at the moment under the current law cannot make them legally enforceable. This Committee has put forward as one of its most important recommendations that such laws be given legal force. The Committee discusses in some detail the way in which that can take place&mdash;grants or tax incentives can be withdrawn, if necessary, and also we can have penalties leading to both fines and imprisonment, if appropriate. We, of course, do not take away the right to take civil action for damages if any person believes that that action is necessary. Given the rapidity with which technology is changing in this area it would be preferable if the guidelines were contained in regulations rather than in an Act of parliament so that the regulations could be kept up to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law provides various remedies for those who may suffer personal injury or property damage from the escape of dangerous animals or from products which are released on the market. There can be difficulties, however, in making a successful case. An example is the difficulty of establishing a duty of care under an action for negligence. The Committee therefore recommends strict liability for damages arising from deliberate releases of GMOs which have not been authorised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the Committee has recommended a two-tiered approach to the regulatory structure for genetic manipulation work. The existing Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee should be retained to consider proposals to carry out contained work involving GMOs and also act as a specialist body. Its members should be chosen on the basis of their expertise in genetic manipulation or environmental science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, a new body, perhaps to be known as a release authority, should be established. This would have the responsibility of considering all proposals to release modified organisms into the environment whether for field trials or as commercial products. The establishment of this release authority should be achieved by complementary State and Federal legislation. Clearly those two bodies would have to work in close cooperation and it is the Committee's recommendation that both bodies should be responsible to the Minister for Science and Technology. I note that we have in the House the former Minister for Science, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), who, in fact, gave us the reference which triggered this inquiry. He and other honourable members would be aware that we had quite some debate about which should be the appropriate Government Minister and department to look after these two bodies. After some discussion, it was recommended that that be the Minister for Science and Technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has proposed that the membership of the release authority should consist of representatives from relevant Commonwealth Government departments, scientific experts, people with an involvement in the commercial development or use of GMOs and people with an interest in environmental or consumer affairs issues. The chairperson of GMAC should also be a member of the release authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of field trials, the release authority should be able to advertise the proposed release for public comment if it considers that desirable and the release authority should publicly advertise proposed releases of any product containing GMOs. In each case the Minister should be advised of a proposed release and we believe the Minister should have the discretion to order a public hearing before the release occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not permit me to go into other details. The Committee has made a large number of recommendations which we believe provide for a balance between encouraging scientific research and development in this area. These will assist Australia while at the same time not risking the safety of the environment or personal health in Australia through the unfortunate release of some GMOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all the members of the Committee, to our staff, that is, our committee secretary, Paul McMahon; John Carter, who has carried out a great deal of work on this inquiry, and our other staff members, Helen Fyfe in particular, who have put in a lot of effort to ensure that this report is a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank also those who made submissions to the inquiry and those who appeared at public hearings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genetic manipulation: the threat or the glory</EMPHASIS>, has a large bull on the front cover. It is a picture that was painted a long time ago. What it clearly demonstrates is that we have been at genetic manipulation in one form or another for a long time and really what has changed are the techniques.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the inquiry, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), has outlined the main points of the report. I am not going to duplicate what he has said. Of course he has talked about some of the main recommendations in terms of procedures and the new body. He mentioned matters like ethics and health and so on. The point that I make initially is that a lot of work has gone into this report which was prepared after some very careful deliberation. I certainly echo the Chairman's thanks and acknowledgment to Paul McMahon, the Committee's Secretary, and to Dr John Carter and to the other members of the staff who have worked long and hard in the preparation of this report with the Committee members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, of course, dealing with a considerably specialised area. One needs to tread carefully. We should also record our thanks to Dr Merilyn Sleigh, who did the technical vetting. She made some very constructive suggestions and perhaps saved us from having some red faces in terms of some of those technical matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading, listening and learning are not always quite enough. One needs experience. So the layman treads in this area at some peril. After 18 months it has been brought home to me that we are talking about a very technical area and a very specialised area. I come from a strong technological background, but I must say that there were occasions when I struggled with some of the matters put before us. Therefore, we have been very cautious in the way in which we have handled the whole subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention briefly that my colleagues the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have dissented from recommendation Nos 2 and 48. They will, of course, speak for themselves on another occasion but I flag their concern. With regard to recommendation No. 2, we have done no detailed work in a particular area and they felt that we need not have made any comment on that. I believe that is a fine distinction. With regard to recommendation No. 48, they very strongly hold the view that decisions should be made in this place and in this chamber before releases are made. I think the majority of members of the Committee took the view that, with the workload involved and the degree of knowledge and expertise required, that was probably an impractical approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking for myself, I came to this inquiry 18 months ago looking for a balanced outcome; looking, if at all possible, to no increase in the overall impact of regulation; and looking to make sure that activity in Australia was no more or no less advantaged or disadvantaged than similar activity in the rest of the world. I wanted to make sure that we protected against abuse. I very quickly came to the view that there was a need for legislation, that there needed to be a proper assessment and consideration of risks, and that we needed to set up a mechanism that was not going to be tied specifically to today's techniques, because the techniques are changing so rapidly. Probably most importantly, in many senses, we needed a national approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we have achieved a lot of those objectives. We have formalised, essentially, the present voluntary code to be able to deal with abuses because, frankly, just having the facility in a voluntary situation to withdraw grants and that sort of thing is not enough. I think we have done it in a way that has not added greatly to the regulation load from a user's point of view. We have retained GMAC as a technical group, but we have recommended the establishment of a new body of wide representation but which, in terms of actually handling the process, will be relatively transparent to the users and, therefore, if you like, will not place extra burdens on those clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking users, essentially, and those involved in the field, to do officially only what the vast majority already accept as being responsible behaviour and which they do anyway. It is important, I think, for those involved in the field to have known standards so that they can deal on a long term planning basis with the work that they are executing. Most of the work in this field is not short term. We need, of course, a basis for avoiding disasters. Whether one talks about thalidomide, the proliferation of cane toads or whatever, obviously those things must not happen in the future. We must also make sure that we practice world standards and norms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment very briefly on the conduct of the inquiry. I think the quality of the evidence from some of the witnesses was, frankly, variable. We had a range of positions from those in the scientific fraternity who said,`Trust us. We are responsible, we don't need any regulation'. I think there was perhaps some shifting of position during the inquiry by some of those people. At the other end of the scale, we often had emotive evidence that obviously therefore was not necessarily based on fact; people took rather entrenched, extreme positions. So it was difficult to sort out an appropriate balance. I draw special attention to some key conclusions in the report. Firstly, I refer to paragraph 3.4 which talks about the sense of balance that we need. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the possible economic, environmental and health benefits from applying genetic manipulation techniques are worth pursuing. Not all of the claimed benefits will materialise. Some applications of the techniques will have risks attached which may outweigh the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like also to draw the attention of the House to paragraph 4.32 which talks about the impact on the planet resulting from the use of this type of technology. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to live on the planet without having an impact upon it. Correct predictions about the extent of those impacts clearly depend on an understanding of the interconnections between the different systems in nature. Equally clearly the health and survival of the human species depends on how those natural systems continue to function. This does not necessarily preclude the use of any particular technology, but it does require that the effects of its use be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that particular extract probably got to the nub of the conflicts that we were trying to sort out during the course of our deliberations. The Chairman has already mentioned the important principle that we have adopted in the report of a case by case approach and we also, of course, had to deal with the rather vexed area of patents. I would refer to paragraph 7.112 where we say that denying the right to patent&mdash;allowed in many other countries&mdash;would probably adversely affect the biotechnology industry in Australia. The decision whether to seek a patent should be a commercial one and it should be made by the companies themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee considers that there is no justification for denying the biotechnology industry the opportunity to use patents to seek a reward for effort. The Patents Act is not the appropriate vehicle for hindering or preventing the development of technologies to which society may have an objection. If that is the aim then more direct means such as legislation should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to differentiate on occasion in this area between product or process. That is another area where the Committee spent many, many hours when we said that it would be an oversimplification to treat all products produced by genetic manipulation techniques as being equally hazardous. The process of manufacture by itself is not a good indication of the dangers which may be inherent in the product. The process of manufacture should however be considered when examining the safety of products for which approval has been sought before sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also draw the attention of the House to paragraph 8.1 which outlines three key reasons why we believe that it is absolutely essential that legislation now be adopted. So it seems to me that genetic engineering can be a tremendous force for good. We need to protect against abuses, especially under commercial pressures, and I believe that in our report the recommendations have done this. We need to match world standards. If we are too restrictive we will lose the benefits overseas. If we are too lax, others from overseas will come here and take advantage and dump dangerous products here. Again, I believe we have achieved this balance. Genetic engineering is doing what man has always done but minimising the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues such as animal welfare, market monopolies and so on, are not unique to this area of endeavour and so they do not need special recommendations or laws in this report. They exist already elsewhere. The guidelines that exist at the moment need to be replaced with legislation to deal with the dishonourable. The honourable will have no difficulty dealing with what we have proposed and from a national perspective benefits to be gained in productivity are huge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a classic industry that this country needs to get into, provided government sets the right framework. The report includes proper and meaningful measures for risk assessment. The report can be implemented by governments of either persuasion, I believe. It needs relatively minor government costs to implement. It will help researchers and the industry alike. Although perhaps overall tending towards a note of caution, I think that is in fact a proper balance in weighing all the competing and conflicting issues. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

The report I have just presented contains the results of the Committee's examination of the Authority's annual report for the financial year ended 30 June 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 and 1991 the Committee conducted a major evaluation of the Authority. The Committee reported in detail on this evaluation in November 1991. Because of this, the report tabled today is relatively brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's basic finding is that the Authority's report is excellent. It is fully satisfactory when evaluated against the statutory requirements and the relevant guidelines for the preparation of annual reports. The report contains a comprehensive index to its contents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some critics of the Authority have argued that the Authority provides the public with insufficient information about its activities. The Committee considers that the detail in the report under review clearly refutes this argument. The Committee's report draws attention to the fact that some journalists ignore changes that have occurred at the Authority in recent years. Allegations dating back to the mid-1980s are still presented in sections of the media as if they were relevant to the present Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Committee and the Authority have previously recognised the difficulties in measuring the performance of law enforcement agencies such as the Authority. In the report presented today, the Committee notes that the Authority is now structuring its annual reports around the objectives, action strategies and performance measures contained in the Authority's corporate plan. The Committee anticipates that, by providing the data specified in the corporate plan's performance measures, future annual reports will improve the ability of the Parliament and the public to assess the Authority's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other matters which the Committee comments upon in its report include the value of the annual report containing more detail on complaints made about the conduct of police working for the Authority, and on the outcomes of investigations into such complaints; the need to use caution in interpreting data in the annual report on amounts seized or frozen as proceeds of crime&mdash;not all such amounts eventually end up in Consolidated Revenue; and the impact of serious court delays in some Australian jurisdictions on prosecutions brought as a result of NCA investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the appointment of Mr Tom Sherman as the new Chairman of the NCA.

<PARA>In paragraph 6.36 of the Committee's report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Who is to Guard the Guards?</EMPHASIS>, an evaluation of the National Crime Authority, tabled on 28 November 1991, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IGC made comments amounting to less than a page on each of the first three annual reports of the Authority. Comments have not been made on subsequent annual reports. The lack of IGC comments strengthens the Committee's view that the IGC has not actively monitored the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>For the information of the House, the IGC was established under section 8 of the Act and it consists of a Commonwealth Minister and a Minister representing each participating State and Territory. All the States and Territories now participate. The functions of the IGC are set out in the Act. One of them is to monitor generally the work of the Authority under section 9(1)(e).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I would like to make a few comments on the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prescribed Health</EMPHASIS>. Part 1 of the report deals with promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, while the following volumes deal with prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that one of the themes running through part 1 of this report is contained in the recommendations that consumers should take more responsibility for their health. Many of the recommendations lead towards that end&mdash;that consumers be able to look at what they are taking and say, `This is good or bad', knowing the effects it would have on their health. For too long consumers have been caught up with what is prescribed. They open a package and in it comes a little slip of paper, in extraordinarily fine print, with technological detail which makes absolutely no sense to anyone except the medical practitioner. Yet the people need a lot of this information, particularly if they should not be mixing one drug with another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major recommendations of the report is that generic names be put on brand labels. This is almost a motherhood type of statement, yet to date this has not been done in the pharmaceutical industry. A generic name is the name of the basic chemical, the active ingredient, that is in the pharmaceutical. I give an example. There is a pharmaceutical called Tenormin and one called Noten. In some instances the doctor finds that a patient is taking both Tenormin and Noten because, having gone to two different doctors on different occasions, perhaps in different cities, the patient is not aware that these two drugs are identical and that he or she is in fact double dosing. Both Tenormin and Noten come under the generic name of atenolol. If these recommendations are taken up then every drug that has atenolol will be labelled `atenolol' above the brand name so that people know what they are taking. This is a very important recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another obvious yet simple recommendation is that there should be room on the pharmaceutical container for the pharmacist's label. Often when people go into a pharmacist and pick up their container they find that the pharmacist's label has gone over the label of the manufacturer. If they want to know more about what they are taking they have to peel one label off and look underneath. The Committee's recommendation is that a gap of exactly seven centimetres by five centimetres be left on the manufacturing label for the insertion of the pharmaceutical information. I have a slight concern about this: for smaller containers this label is going to be too big. If the recommendation is followed some pharmaceutical companies will have to move their products into larger containers. But the idea and the principle is certainly a very good one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would seem to be an obvious recommendation, but something that has not been adopted in the pharmaceutical industry, is that pharmacists' instructions be written in plain English. That is recommendation 6. That recommendation is taken even further in recommendation 40, which recommends that all approved consumer information be written in plain English. This is the information found inside the packet on the drug's possible side effects and the danger of taking it with another particular drug. That information right now is extraordinarily hard for consumers to find. Under the Committee's recommendations, hopefully they will be able to find out for themselves what the medications could do to them and what side effects they might experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 39 goes further than the Baume report, recommending that the Therapeutic Goods Administration not only evaluate patient information but approve it formally. Hopefully, this means patients will have full information on the side effects of drugs they are taking as well as the effects of drugs taken in combination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 41 is quite interesting. It recommends that all drug information should be collected in a compendium so that libraries and consumer groups can keep a record of all drugs and what happens, their side effects, for those people who wish to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 20 suggests that consumers should be given a greater voice by including a representative from peak consumer health groups on the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association Complaints Committee. Once again, as I said, this theme of getting more consumers involved in their medical industry and what they are taking comes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the recommendations of this report are adopted, the end result will be that consumers know more about what they are taking, will avoid many iatrogenic complications due to multiple drug use and will, hopefully, take more responsibility for their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to congratulate the secretariat for the work it did in this report. I would also like to comment that secretariats are often not given their full credit for the amount of work that they put into reports. Reports are acknowledged as committee reports but, more often than not, it is the secretariat that does something like 95 per cent of the work and this secretariat should be congratulated on the enormous amount of work it has put into this report. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">From my point of view, the most exciting and potentially productive work of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs concerning its reference on the prescription and supply of drugs was a two-day conference held last July. The Committee on that occasion became observers rather than inquisitors as representatives of the various participants, including industrialists, medicos, pharmacists, academics and consumers, heatedly argued the pros and cons of securing a strategic approach to medicines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of that fascinating dialectical encounter, substantial agreement was achieved on the best structure for an Australia-wide national medicinal drug policy which would maintain a viable expanding pharmaceutical industry, deliver high quality products to consumers, ensure equity of access to Australians and maintain high standards of use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 4 of the report deals with the industry and the need to ensure that the boards of pharmaceutical companies, in pursuit of their duties to maximise shareholders' profits, are even more concerned about their ethical responsibility to consumers in the manufacture, advertising and packaging of what are frequently very dangerous substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation that companies provide the Pharmaceutical Benefits Pricing Authority with information that includes the breakdown of costing of all promotional activities will benefit the public interest by enabling sensible guidelines to be set to limit excessive promotional spending, which has the antisocial effect of encouraging excessive drug use as well as overpricing drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is strongly supportive of the concept of a code of ethical principles to guide not only manufacturers but also professional organisations dealing with the health industry. Disquieting evidence was put before the Committee about unethical promotional stunts and activities. I refer to pseudo-educational junkets for doctors to tourist fleshpots, lavish luncheons, gifts of expensive computers and the like. The blatant objective of these promotional pitches was not educational but was to provide incentives to doctors to prescribe a particular line of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also concern about what was described as bogus drug trials. That concern led to the Committee's endorsement of the Trade Practices Commission's proposition that the ethical codes of the British industry and physicians should be adopted in Australia to control both trials and incentive schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee felt that consumers, who pay both the monetary and the health price, should be represented on the self-regulating subcommittee of manufacturers and that health officials be given observer status to ensure that the proceedings stay in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the public is to have any confidence in a self-regulating code as in the system at the moment, the subcommittee should have the power to recommend sanctions. The report supports not only such a power but also the bestowing of powers of corrective advertising and the imposition of fines for breaches of the advertising code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, manufacturers in breach of the code would be obliged to submit draft retraction statements for approval. Amendment to those statements could be made and then published in the manner that the subcommittee deems appropriate. Doctors would be given full opportunity to read retractions. Frankly, there is no point in manufacturers retracting advertising statements if the doctors prescribing the drugs do not see those retractions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defiance of the subcommittee would result in either departmental or legal action. As with all self-regulatory codes, problems arise with the manufacturers who are not members of the Proprietary Medicines Association of Australia. It is recommended that the complaints mechanism apply to them also and that autonomy be given to the complaints panel, which would be strengthened by consumer and departmental representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up breaches of the advertising code, a monitoring committee is also recommended. There is no point in having a watchdog unless the watchdog is aware of breaches of the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to these consumer issues because I have always been cynical about self-regulatory systems. Too often they become self-protection systems, indulging in whitewashes, procrastinations and self-justifications. However, I have given my support to the regime proposed by the Committee and the Trade Practices Commission because it does provide novel safeguards that could well keep a self-regulating system honest. I feel the experiment is deserving of a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the quality of medicinal drug usage requires far greater commitment from manufacturers and health professionals alike to providing better information, education and team work. Professor Baume has faced the vexatious problem of drug evaluation with all its risks, red tape and recurring delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee was mainly concerned, however, with the important information question of the need for an Australian national formulary to provide drug information to prescribers and dispensers alike. That formulary could also include Australian therapeutic guidelines. Most medical practitioners use what is called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">MIMS Bi-Monthly</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">MIMS Annual</EMPHASIS> prescription proprietary guide as their primary reference. It is a reference generated by private industry and has various shortcomings, not the least of which is that it is cluttered with advertising material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real need for a national formulary that will provide drug information and allow the selection of the best drug for the specific patient. The suggestion is that the information could be provided in a computerised format, initially updated annually but later on a more regular basis. The inclusion of uniform therapeutic guidelines would greatly assist practitioners to select the best drug for the patient's circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee saw the important role for government in the prescription and supply of drugs as bringing to reality a national drug strategy and cementing the relationship between consumers, their health professionals and the industry. The Committee took the view that the pharm working party, which is currently developing an educational strategy to achieve the necessary cooperation between all concerned, is the initiative that could assist to put in place the framework and mechanisms necessary for progress in the quality use of pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times a great deal has been said about the need to contain costs in our national health system. Great cost is being incurred by prescription drug misuse. That misuse not only includes the 20,000 Australians admitted to hospitals suffering from poisoning as a result of prescription mistakes but also overuse and failure to take drugs as prescribed. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Committee hope that this first report will contribute to this herculean task of saving our health dollar, but more importantly will lead to improving the health of Australians. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs on the prescription and supply of drugs has been several years in the making. The inquiry was first referred to the Committee in the previous Parliament and its terms of reference were advertised in 1989. Progress with the inquiry was delayed by the dissolution of parliament in early 1990. The inquiry resumed in July 1990, and by October 1990 had received 130 submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Committee's investigations it quickly became apparent that older people suffer particular difficulties as consumers of pharmaceuticals. A number of witnesses gave evidence that elderly people are far more likely to suffer adverse drug reactions and complications than the rest of our community. This is often the result of older people being on multiple medications and reflects the fact that people's metabolisms change with age. As a consequence, manufacturers' recommended adult doses of self-administered non-prescription medications as displayed on packaged labels may not be appropriate or safe for older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee acknowledges the important role that pharmacists play in counselling patients on correct dosage rates. However, we remain concerned that people purchasing non-prescription drugs from supermarkets and other non-pharmacy outlets may receive little such counselling. As a result, they may not be aware that stated dosage rates for adults may be dangerously inappropriate for older people. The Committee has recognised this problem for older people and recommended that the National Health and Medical Research Council examine the possibility of including a cautionary note on non-prescription drugs, advising older people to consult a pharmacist or doctor on appropriate dosage rates for their age, weight and state of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a similar note, the Committee became aware that the cautionary statements required on medication packages may not be clear to all members of the community. For example, it has been argued that the standard existing labels, such as the `Supply without prescription illegal' label, which is seen on most prescription products, may not be as clear as `Pharmacy only' or `Prescription only'. The Committee is aware of research being done into the effectiveness of medicine warning labels by a number of agencies, but believes that further research is needed. As a result, the Committee has recommended that government agencies give greater consideration to simplifying the warning statements that appear on medicine labels. The Committee has also recommended that all pharmacists' instructions should be written in plain English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an increasingly sophisticated society, consumers are expecting the right of access to information on the drugs they are prescribed. The Committee believes that consumers of pharmaceuticals have a right to information on drug and non-drug therapies, the effects of drugs and any possible adverse reaction that can be expected from taking medicine. Not only should consumers receive such information as a right, but also evidence suggests that well informed patients are more likely to take their medicines correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer education information requires a multi-disciplinary approach with involvement from manufacturers, health professionals, consumer groups and government agencies. The key to such information is that it should be provided, either verbally or in writing, in a form that is easily understood by consumers. Furthermore, consumers should have the confidence that the information they are receiving is both accurate and balanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the drug evaluation process, manufacturers are already required to use a product information document called PI for all prescription drugs and new chemical entities. All PIs require endorsement by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee as a precondition for marketing approval. They list, among other things, a drug's approved indications, dosage rates, appropriate warnings and possible adverse reactions. However, this product information is intended for health professionals only and is written in highly technical language which is not directly appropriate as consumer information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his report on the future of drug evaluation in Australia, Professor Baume recommended that in future manufacturers should be required to furnish consumer information as well as product information before their product could be marketed. The consumer information would be written directly for consumers, although it would have to remain consistent with the approved product information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Baume's recommendation has now been adopted. However, the TGA is only required to evaluate patient information and does not have to approve it formally. The Committee believes that this information should have the TGA's stamp of approval so that consumers can be confident that the information has been independently evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has therefore extended Professor Baume's recommendation to include that the Therapeutic Goods Administration be required formally to approve consumer information to be termed `approved consumer information' or `ACI'. Furthermore, once the Therapeutic Goods Administration has evaluated the clinical details of ACI, they should be forwarded to appropriate health education specialists to ensure that the ACI has been written in plain English and is likely to be understood by non-specialists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that approved consumer information should explain in simple language what a drug is, what it does, how it should and should not be taken, when it should and should not be taken, what other drugs it might interact with and how, and list any significant adverse reactions that might occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended that ACI be available to consumers via pharmacy computers to be used as a supplement to pharmacists' verbal counselling. Furthermore, the Committee believes that approved consumer information should be printed in a compendium which is available for purchase by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has also noted a number of alternative sources of consumer information, including a range of consumer orientated guides on pharmaceuticals that are of variable quality and ease of use. A number of manufacturers also produce explanatory pamphlets on particular drugs for distribution to patients through medical practitioners. The Committee wishes to encourage this practice.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee fully supports the publication of any helpful consumer information, providing it is accurate and balanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern to the Committee has been the lack of regulation of the advertising of alternative and traditional medicines. The Nutritional Foods Association, which represents a number of manufacturers of herbal preparations, mineral and vitamin supplements, homoeopathic preparations and other traditional medicines, has had a voluntary code of conduct for advertising these products to both health professionals and the public. However, compliance with this code was voluntary for members of the Nutritional Foods Association and has fallen into disuse. The Committee notes that an expanded code is currently being written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is concerned that some alternative medicines, herbal remedies and vitamin supplements have been advertised using exaggerated therapeutic claims, such as that they were `good for the brain' or `reduced ageing'. These types of claims have no scientific basis, are too vague and may mislead members of the public into purchasing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the passage of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, advertisements to the public for alternative medicines are not required to meet the provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. However, the Committee was told that a number of manufacturers of alternative products are breaching that code. Some manipulate the grey area created by the overlap of therapeutic goods legislation and food legislation, and some simply disregard the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Nutritional Foods Association and the Commonwealth Department of Health, Housing and Community Services have been trying to educate such manufacturers about their responsibilities under the Therapeutic Goods Act and the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code. The Department has told the Committee that it will start prosecuting persistent offenders. The Committee supports this move as it believes it is vital that consumers are protected from false and misleading advertising, particularly for substances that may be harmful if taken inappropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear, after working on this Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), that there was a learning process for new members such as myself. The experience of those sitting on the Committee was of great value to those of us who were introduced to the Committee in 1990. I thank the Chairman. I thank the officers of that Committee. I think the secretariat has done a great job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think that this is a most difficult area; it has many branches and all the branches have leaves. Having regard to that, the effect on the community is enormous and the cost to the Government is even greater. Of all the things that members of this House do, committee work provides us with an opportunity to actually go and do some hands-on work with the community where there will be some direct benefit to somebody in each of our electorates and across the nation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact of life that hundreds of thousands of Australians are dependent upon prescription drugs for the maintenance of their daily health. Such drugs extend from those taken to contain high blood pressure or prevent tension, to those used to reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, however, this level of dependence is seldom matched by adequate knowledge on the part of the consumer of the relative capacity, characteristics and consequences of the drugs on which they rely. This lack of knowledge is addressed, at least in part, by the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prescribed Health</EMPHASIS>, which was presented to the Parliament this week by the Chairman, the honourable member for Scullin, (Mr Jenkins), who is my colleague and sitting next to me in the House at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignorance of the characteristics of prescribed medication is not without its costs. In referring to this particular problem, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) had commented that approximately 40 per cent of all drug related poisoning cases admitted to public hospitals, an estimated 20,000 people per year, are caused by incorrect use of prescription medicines. It is a large problem. It is on this element of the need for consumer health awareness and education that I would like to focus my remarks today. I do not believe it is an accident that the majority of the members of the Committee who have spoken in this debate have also concentrated on that element of the report's application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area is of considerable importance to the community and the Committee recommended a number of ways in which it could be improved. For instance, as mentioned by the honourable member for Scullin in his remarks earlier this week and the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) today, we have recommended that the generic name of a drug should be more prominently displayed than the brand name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because I happen to be an asthmatic and take quite a number of drugs, as do many people in this House, including the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) who is at the table, I would like to point out that, when a person receives a drug from a pharmacist or even from a doctor, on most occasions the drug itself is housed in a brand container. I have here, for instance, a Ventolin inhaler, a Becutide inhaler and some Theodur tablets. They are all brand names. Most of the people who take these drugs, I would put it to the House, would not be aware of the substance names, the ingredients, in effect, that they are taking when they utilise these drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one were to buy Theodur over the counter of a pharmacy on prescription from one's doctor&mdash;this is a systemic drug which is supposed to keep asthma at bay during the day&mdash;one would not necessarily know, unless one was very clever and particularly insistent on removing the label from the drug, that it was theophylline that one was taking and that this obviously has particular application to asthma. So as a consequence, if a new drug, a new brand, were to come onto the market which was not Theodur, for instance, one might not realise that the same basic ingredient was contained in that drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of an example, I have here a little bottle from a hospital that was given to me that was very well labelled. It says `Theophylline, 200 milligrams'. In brackets underneath and in smaller type it says `Theodur', which of course is the brand name. It says `Take swallowed whole with water, twice daily after food'. That is from the emergency department of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. I have kept that bottle and I keep my drugs in that bottle, so it looks pretty rubbishy now, because it is<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> actually one of the best explanations of what the drug is and what you take the drug for and how you take it. I think that is important for people when they are consuming fairly large amounts of drugs for life saving purposes or for the maintenance of their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same goes for Ventolin. Most people are not aware of what it is. It is in a little container but all of the information is actually on the back of the label that is tucked away inside the container that people use to actually spray the Ventolin. That says that it is a schedule 3 drug, which we will talk about in a little while. It says that it is a Ventolin inhaler in rather large letters and in a different colour, and that it contains 200 metered doses of&mdash;and this is the key&mdash;Salbutamol. That is the point, that is actually the ingredient, the drug. Ventolin is simply a brand name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same point, asthmatics who are being treated properly by a doctor and properly advised will often be taking another drug in addition to their Ventolin, and that drug is generally a beclomethasone which is known as either Becotide or Aldecin. They are very commonly available drugs although only by prescription. But many people will commit themselves totally to taking Aldecin without realising that in fact Becotide is the same drug under a different brand name. They can be confused and concerned unnecessarily if they are thought to be taking what they were not prescribed to take. Alternatively they could be taking the same drug twice as the honourable member for Hawker mentioned earlier in her speech today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem is that on some of these things they say `Not to be taken with any other preparation for asthma'. I think the Ventolin one says `Do not use with other asthma sprays or remedies and avoid frequent and prolonged use'. Everybody who is an asthmatic uses Ventolin nearly all the time. I think very few people would actually know that that warning is on that drug, let alone that it says `Do not use with another asthma medication' when it is prescribed frequently to be used in conjunction with Aldecin or Becotide. So I am just making a point to people, from personal experience, that there is a lot of confusion and a great lack of knowledge on these questions of prescribed drug medication and the way that you should take them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions pertaining to consumer education and knowledge cannot be considered in isolation from promotion and advertising of prescription drugs. This area of activity was also looked at by the Committee which recommended that a greater proportion of financial resources should be spent on educational as opposed to brand name or product promotional advertising. That is partly what we have been referring to here. These recommendations, the ones that I believe are the most important, cover quite a number of the chapters. Recommendation 2 is referring to the drugs that are schedule 3 drugs. That says that the blanket prohibition on advertising of all schedule 3 drugs to the public should remain. That is obviously to prevent people hawking what is effectively quite a dangerous drug and one that should only be prescribed for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation is the discussion of the generic name relative to the size of the product name, the brand name, which has been mentioned by a number of members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth recommendation is the one that says that there should be a specific space on each product to allow for the instructions on usage. That specific space was 70 millimetres by 50 millimetres so that a pharmacist can affix a label to the drug without obscuring the relevant information by the producer of the drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth recommendation which is also very important says that both the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the National Health and Medical Research Council should give greater consideration to simplifying the warning statements that appear on medicine labels so that people are quite clear on what may go wrong if they misuse or abuse the specific drug being discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same context of consumer information and education, in recommendation 20 the Committee also recommended that a representative from a peak consumer health group with the appropriate background should be included on the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association complaints subcommittee. The Committee recommended in recommendation 27 that the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association develop a comprehensive publicity program, including, but not restricted to, immediate steps to publish, in various widely read medical journals, articles on the code and its requirements. The Association has a specific code which covers the production and publicity of drugs. Many people in the industry are not absolutely aware of how the code operates so we believe that is important for them and also from the consumer's point of view at the doctor level. I commend the recommendations of the Committee to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To read again the old newspaper cuttings of events leading up to that terrible day in October 1975 when five journalists&mdash;three Australians, one Briton and one New Zealander&mdash;were executed by the Indonesian military is to feel a chill go down one's spine. Two days later it was reported that the mystery had deepened as to their whereabouts. A couple of days later hope remained but there were grave concerns. Then the awful truth began to dawn. The charred bodies of four Europeans had been found in a house in Balibo where the men had last been seen filming the Indonesian invasion which was not supposed to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Whitlam Government of the day made inquiries but kept insisting that there was no confirmation of the reports of the journalists' deaths. On 23 October a spokesman for the Timorese resistance movement, Fretilin, revealed that the men had been executed as communist sympathisers and an eye witness report of the shootings came later. The Liberal shadow Minister for foreign affairs at the time, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), protested at the inactivity of the Government. The Whitlam Government, in fact, acted contrary to its own Caucus. Unable to decide not to not support the self-determination of a neighbour, and timid at getting offside with a large neighbour, it did nothing. By doing nothing the Whitlam Government sealed the fate of the Timorese people. But worse than that, it gave a green light to the invasion by supporting East Timor's integration into Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, for all our subsequent obsequious cringing and forelock tugging before Indonesia, our relations with that country have been barely cordial. Indeed, they soured almost immediately as we were so annoying as to ask whether we could send our representatives to check out the bodies of the dead journalists. The Fraser Government then stamped its approval on the Indonesian takeover in 1979. Mr Hawke subsequently did what even Mr Whitlam did not do and acknowledged Indonesian sovereignty in 1984. It shows what shabby shifts the ruthless pursuit of power can lead to when amorality is disguised as pragmatism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest massacre, last year, in which a New Zealand student studying in Australia was mown down along with 100 or so other church attenders or church funeral mourners in Dili is only the most recent example of the contempt of Indonesia for its neighbour. Contrary to what Senator Evans says, the rest of the world does not recognise the annexation of East Timor. The United Nations has never recognised Indonesia's sovereignty. Even Japan, which, in the last world war, slaughtered 40,000 Timorese suspected of succouring Australian soldiers, recently protested about the takeover by Indonesia. The parallels with the situation in Kuwait are just too glaringly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, said in an interview on 17 February last year that Australia is prepared to help with ongoing human rights problems that do crop up from time to time in East Timor. Whereas Iraqi soldiers killed several thousand Kuwaitis, the Indonesians have, according to Amnesty International, been the cause of the death, through execution, torture, famine and malnutrition, of up to 200,000 people of that nation. Australia is a joint venture partner with a country that has had death squads and concentration camps in East Timor and whose very coming into existence from a collection of disparate islands was predicated on the slaughter of some quarter of a million people in the 1950s. The situation in Timor is as bad as any place under Nazi rule, and Indonesia is largely a totalitarian state. The leader of the resistance forces in Timor said in an interview with the ABC that Australia was an accomplice in genocide of the people of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian Government's response to last year's massacre has been described as `credible' by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is really a case of damning with very faint praise. We are expected to be grateful that Indonesia has bowed slightly to international pressure and the threat of losing international aid. As a result of the Jaelani inquiry, eight soldiers are to be court-martialled and disciplinary action taken against a further six. The six against whom action is being taken include two generals, the former East Timor military commander and the former regional commander. It was, I admit, an unprecedented response by Indonesia, but the fact is that many questions remain unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still the question of the large number of people who went missing in the mass round-up after the November massacre. Indonesia is planning to try 13 East Timorese for provoking what witnesses describe as a peaceful demonstration. These charges carry the maximum penalty of death. An international panel of jurists has condemned the Indonesian Government for holding the victims responsible. The Commission estimates that the number of dead in the massacre is up to 200, but the official toll is that only about 50 died, which is an upgrading from the 19 originally alleged by the Government. The implication is somehow that, if only a handful of people died in East Timor, it is really not much of a concern. We are treating the extinction of human lives just like so many packets that we could knock off the supermarket shelves. We in Australia have a great debt to Timor because of the 40,000 Timorese who died in 1942 at Japanese hands because they had been sheltering Australian soldiers. Only 30,000 Australians were killed in the theatres of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Government's policy has been one of gravel grazing before the military might of Indonesia. Let us not pretend to take a moral stance about this: our position all along has been pragmatic, which is really only a euphemism for allowing practical exigencies to excuse anything. This Government has fallen over itself to shield Indonesia from criticism concerning East Timor. We should be clear about this. This amounts to nothing more than appeasement over serious and continuing human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we in this country have a genuine desire to further our trade with Indonesia, trade which is largely in our favour, but that ought not to be at the price of consistent denial of human rights. Let us also export to Indonesia the rule of law and freedom of expression and impartial justice. The over-readiness of Foreign Minister Evans to appease Indonesia's concerns was evident in his authorisation of the removal of crosses set up outside the Indonesian Embassy by the Timorese protesters to represent the slain in Timor. They had been blessed by a Catholic priest and impeded no-one's movement. Yet anti-apartheid protesters stayed outside the South African Embassy for much of the 1970s. When an anti-apartheid demonstrator got inside the Embassy compound and was assaulted by a diplomat, that diplomat was expelled from this country. Yet there was no action taken against Indonesian Embassy staff who threw bricks and bottles from inside the Embassy grounds, allegedly breaking the hand of one of the Timorese demonstrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the Timor Gap treaty, many lawyers believe that Portugal has a very strong case against Australia and Indonesia in the international court, although one must say about Portugal also that its failure to look after the colony of which it was the colonial master for so long contributed to the problem that we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to say that it is human rights not self-determination which is the issue in East Timor. Yet the Indonesians themselves have stated their belief that human rights assertion leads to self-determination. The problem is that, years after independence, this 180 million-strong population covering 13,000 islands, is only held together by brute force. The Indonesians are involved in bludgeoning the people throughout the archipelago. There are reports that the military has acted even more brutally in suppressing the rebellion in Aceh than it has in East Timor but that Western countries are not much interested because the atrocities are committed against Muslims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that we despise the depredations of large powers against a small one, as in Kuwait and the Falklands, or the suppression of civil rights, as in South Africa, but it is all right when the bully is so large and powerful as in Tibet and Timor that we dare not say too much. For all our gravel grazing and forelock tugging, Senator Gareth Evans was still snubbed recently in Jakarta when no Indonesian leader deigned to meet him. We trust that the Prime Minister will have better success. We have bought this so-called friendship at too high a price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very sad that, as a nation, we find ourselves in a dilemma regarding our relationship with Indonesia. It is a point taken very strongly by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) who characterised the present Government's attitude in relation to the East Timor massacre as pragmatic. He did have the grace to say that the former Fraser Government also acknowledged and accepted the legitimacy of the Indonesian takeover of East Timor. It has always been the case that there have only ever been in this Parliament a handful of members who have taken the cause of the East Timorese people more seriously than the question of our pragmatic relations with a large neighbouring power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I count amongst those who did put the interests of the people of East Timor in front of the pragmatic considerations, my predecessor, the former member for Denison, Michael Hodgman, who I think singularly on his side of politics, through that period spoke out continually in favour of the East Timorese right to self-determination and against the process of human rights abuses, which independent authorities such as Amnesty International have catalogued as proceeding, not just over recent times, but for the decade since the Indonesians conquered the East Timor province by military force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think I would be remiss if I did not mention the work of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), who chairs a cross-party group in this Parliament, concerned to continue to represent the interests of those people of East Timor in a context where both sides in this Parliament generally accept the reality&mdash;not necessarily liking it&mdash;that our national interests require us to take a more pragmatic position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my own part, I welcome the strength of the views expressed by the honourable member for Reid and the honourable member for Menzies. I think it is very important that, in this Parliament, on both sides, there are those who articulate so forcefully and strongly and so unflinchingly what, in a sense, is a heartfelt understanding of the basic moral dilemmas. It cannot be right that a nation such as East Timor, a people such as the East Timorese, can be conquered by force, made subject to what on any fair account would be brutal repression for over a decade, be subjected to human rights abuses of a kind that we would regard as being entirely outside the framework of the United Nations Charter on Human Rights, without our being deeply moved to condemn it. But notwithstanding that, I think he does insufficient justice to the strength of the Australian response since the Dili massacre in November of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's response may not have been as comprehensive as would have been wished by the honourable member for Menzies, but his own Party spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), felt that the motion that was moved on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House went too far. The honourable member has sought to move amendments that soften the terms of that motion. I oppose those softenings. I believe that the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), comprehensively expresses the total and absolute abhorrence of all honourable members of the events of November last year. The motion puts it in a framework which allows the Australian Government to take a stronger stand than it has done ever since that invasion took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With no great pride, I have to reiterate that successive governments have adopted a pragmatic response. It is not unique to this Government. It characterised the Whitlam Government, it characterised the Fraser Government, it characterised the Hawke Government and, of necessity, I imagine it will continue to characterise the Keating Government. That does not mean that individual members of this Parliament&mdash;and particularly those who, as I have, have associated themselves in the past with the parliamentary group for East Timor&mdash;should not speak out much more strongly than our Government to push that Government as far as it will go. But it is important for us also to recognise when that Government does take courageous acts and does make a stand in defence of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, what Australia has done is to take matters much further than it ever has in the past in terms of the strength of its representation and the content of that representation. It has, I believe, played no little part in what the honourable member for Menzies acknowledged is an unprecedented occurrence in that the military commanders of the district covering East Timor now face disciplinary charges, court martials and other proceedings and are being called to account for the way in which that administration permitted the massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had Australia been supine and had it adopted the position which the honourable member for Menzies suggests was gravel grazing&mdash;and I am not sure what gravel grazing is, but I do not think either that or forelock tugging characterised our response in the least&mdash;then there would have been no such public process. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) took it upon himself to travel to Indonesia. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Menzies characterised as a snub, that action focused Australia's concerns in a most direct and blunt way and led, I believe, to the Indonesian Government starting to reassess its approach to the province. I hope that is the case, because the last thing honourable members would hope would be that Indonesia would continue to behave as it has in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is always more that our Government can and ought to do. For my own part, I share the view of the honourable members for Reid, Moreton and Menzies that the whole question of self-determination ought not be put out of court. I do that against the background that successive Australian governments have not agreed and that the majority of honourable members and the majority of honourable senators would no doubt vote against such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that we should be doing all that we can actively to show our concern for those who are the victims of this process and yet who face trial. Those trials are likely to proceed in Jakarta. There are 13 East Timorese who face a number of charges arising out of the disturbances which preceded the massacre. I believe that it would be warranted for Australia to send observers to those trials. I understand that, in response to a question to him in the Senate, the Foreign Minister has indicated that at present, given the resources available to our Embassy in Indonesia and the fact that he will be monitoring the trials by other means, he does not think it warranted to send those observers. For my own part, I would encourage him to reassess that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would urge this House to reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas. It does, I believe, reflect much more fairly the forelock tugging mentality that the honourable member for Menzies would have us reject. In my opinion the original motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton is stronger, more determined and more accurately reflects the sentiment of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity this morning to discuss this important issue. I begin by saying that the events of 12 November 1991 in Dili, East Timor, were nothing short of tragic. What began as a basic exercise in democratic rights turned into an outrageous abuse of human rights. No-one could deny this and Australia quite rightly joined the rest of the world in condemning the shootings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian annexation of East Timor has had a long and troubled history and Australia's reaction has ranged between moral outrage and hostile acceptance. For Australia, the Dili massacre put the entire East Timor issue fairly and squarely back on the front page. It reminded us how close we are to Indonesia and how events in our immediate region necessarily affect us. The way in which we respond to incidents like the one in Dili last November is therefore very important. Too often, I think, we have been quick to criticise and point fingers, eager to barge in and tell others what to do. This not only causes great offence but also, most unfortunately, does not help the people directly affected&mdash;in this case the East Timorese. Imagine the outrage in this nation if the Indonesian Government were to tell us how to conduct the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a middle order power, Australia has an opportunity to influence and shape politics in our part of the world. We can do this only if we learn to work with our neighbours. We do reserve the right&mdash;and, indeed, we have the responsibility&mdash;to protest human rights abuses where we see them. We have a collective responsibility to stand up for the oppressed and to defend the weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period immediately after the Dili massacre, however, Australia's reaction placed us in a position where we ran the very real risk of being ignored by Indonesia. Sections of our community clearly overreacted to the matter. The South Coast Labour Council in New South Wales, for example, immediately placed bans on the handling of a shipment of Port Kembla steel slabs. What was the benefit of that? Firstly, it had no effect on Indonesian Government policy, secondly, it did nothing for the depressed Illawarra region of Australia and, thirdly and most importantly, it did nothing for the East Timorese, the people at the centre of the matter and the ones who are too often overlooked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We make a lot of noise about being part of the Asia-Pacific region, but do we really do much about it? If we are to play a meaningful role in the protection of international human rights, we must keep the lines of communication open. We will never be able to do that until we learn to get off our high horse and learn to deal effectively with the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Indonesia, and most of the Asia-Pacific region, could survive very well without us, and unless we attend to our relationships in this area there is a very real likelihood of some economic and diplomatic isolation bearing down on us. Indonesia is a large nation of 180 million people situated only a few hundred kilometres north of Australia. Our proximity, however, has never enhanced our relations. At present Australia has about $1.3 million invested in Indonesia, and our two-way trade is worth approximately $2.2 billion, with Australia enjoying a small surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the Asia-Pacific region offers the greatest growth prospects in the world and the greatest opportunities for exporters. At present, however, the trade with our ASEAN neighbours makes up only 10 per cent of Australia's total trade. In the last year this trade increased by 23 per cent from $8 billion to $9.9 billion, and Australian exports to ASEAN in the last five years have trebled to $6.3 billion, whereas imports have doubled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as having a trade surplus with Indonesia, Australia now has a trade surplus with Singapore and the Philippines. Despite this, our share of the ASEAN market has remained fairly constant as the economic growth of the ASEAN nations continues to expand. Growth in ASEAN nations averages 6 to 7 per cent, even higher in some places. In 40 years time the Asia-Pacific market will be more than twice the size of the combined markets of America and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Asia-Pacific region is changing rapidly and the way we relate to our neighbours has never been more important. Indonesia makes it quite clear that it can probably live without us. To avoid being hurt by an American-European trade war should the Uruguay Round of GATT fail, we need to develop far closer trading and diplomatic relations with Asia. Japan is no longer the only significant economy in that area. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are taking over, with the fast developing countries of Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia not far behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have effective relations with the countries in the Asia-Pacific region we must learn to conduct relations on an equal basis. Protecting human rights and promoting closer links, especially economic links, are not mutually exclusive. If we really want to improve the lives of the East Timorese we will maintain and further develop our relations with Indonesia, not turn our backs. It can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Northern Territory signed an agreement with Indonesia to formalise a five-year economic development plan for eastern Indonesia and a trade partnership zone. It is worth while recalling that the Northern Territory Minister for Industries and Development, Steve Hatton, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that by providing this social and economic development to eastern Indonesia, we will be contributing towards opening up Indonesian society. No-one supports what occurred in Dili,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but what is heartening is that, for the first time the government (of Indonesia) is taking decisive action.</PARA>
<PARA>Successive Australian governments&mdash;Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke&mdash;have accepted Indonesia's presence in East Timor. It is interesting to note that Australia remains one of the few nations&mdash;along with India, Papua New Guinea and the United States&mdash;that give de jure recognition to the Indonesian presence there. We cannot turn our backs on history&mdash;it is time to look forward. The Indonesian reaction to the Dili massacre gives us a good base to work on. Significantly, the Indonesian Government did not accept the initial military explanation of the incident. The Indonesian commission of investigation was critical of the military. It found that, firstly, the number of dead and injured was greater than first acknowledged; secondly, proper riot control procedures were not employed; thirdly, excessive force was used; and, fourthly, the manner in which the dead were handled was inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Suharto has removed key military officers from East Timor. The military has disciplined six officers, and eight military personnel are to be court-martialled. These are unprecedented actions for the Indonesian Government. The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Phillip Flood, has said that the Dili massacre caused a significant shift in Indonesian policies regarding the area, and the Indonesian Government's reaction to it was a major defeat for the hard liners. This is some encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we remain concerned that 90 people are still missing despite these actions. We also remain concerned about reports of human rights abuses in East Timor, and we must continue to support UN efforts to protect human rights in the region and, indeed, around the whole world. However, if we really want to help the people of East Timor we must not lock ourselves out through self-righteous lecturing and hysterical overreaction. The growth of the Asia-Pacific region will have major ramifications for everyone in this area. We will all benefit if we all learn to work together in this cause. </PARA>

At this time, some four months after the Dili massacre, it is appropriate that the House reconsider the motion and review what has occurred over the four months since we last debated this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I moved the motion in the House on 29 November last year, I did so with a deep sense of sorrow and distress at the massive loss of life that had occurred in Dili and a sense of frustration that it appeared that, after 16 years of occupation of East Timor by Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities had still not learnt any lessons about the way in which to supervise East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time I think Indonesia has faced a lot of international pressure, a lot of criticism and justified condemnation over this massacre. Probably it is fair to say that the events of 12 November have become very much a watershed in Indonesian politics because the Indonesian Government's response to the massacre has been the most dramatic that I have ever seen within Indonesian politics and has resulted in some fundamental changes in domestic Indonesian affairs and in the relationship between the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian armed forces. Some of the changes are very welcome. They do not go far enough, but I think they are a healthy start and I welcome them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend a few moments examining what has occurred in the last four months and to comment on where I think we should be going from here. Firstly, the Indonesian Government set up a commission of inquiry into the events, and that commission visited Dili and spent some considerable time speaking to a range of people who were either witnesses to or participants in the events of 12 November. From that inquiry we have had a fairly strong report which has clearly criticised the actions of the Indonesian military. It has also criticised the actions of the East Timorese who participated in the demonstration. It has recommended action by the Indonesian Government to pursue the participants involved in the massacre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first time that such a commission of inquiry has occurred and I think it came as a bit of a shock, particularly to the Indonesian military forces, that they would be subjected to such an inquiry. It is very important that it has occurred, and I think it has taught the Indonesian military a very important lesson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time action has been taken against the people identified in the commission of inquiry's report and a number of military officers have been demoted or have been subject to court martial or have had various other punishments inflicted upon them. Whether or not that is sufficient punishment for the massacre of over 100 people is an important question, but the fact is that it is the first time that the Indonesian Government has taken any sort of action like that, and I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, however, that I certainly do not welcome the court action, the charges that have been laid against East Timorese who are accused of subversion and who are facing court trials and possible death sentences if they are found guilty. It appears to me quite strange that the people who are the victims of the massacre, the people who have suffered massively from 16 years of occupation, are the only ones who are really actually facing any sort of punitive measures or any severe punitive measures against them. Nevertheless, for the first time, I think, in Indonesia's history since independence, action has been taken against military officers for their excessive actions, and I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a considerable amount of effort by the international community, including Australia, to address some of the fundamental issues regarding the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. One such issue is the Indonesian military forces' appalling human rights record. The Australian Government has been an active participant in discussions with members of the Indonesian Government to try to convince them that they must change their attitudes and they must change the way in which they deal with the people of East Timor. I welcome the fact that the Indonesian Government has recognised that its human rights record is not good and that there is a need to change. But fundamental to any resolution to this East Timorese question is a recognition that the last 16 years of Indonesian administration has proven to be a total failure. Despite all their efforts and the pouring in of probably hundreds of millions of dollars into East Timor, the Indonesian Government has not convinced the East Timorese people that being part of Indonesia is in their best interests. They have abjectly failed in that objective. The East Timorese people do not wish to be part of Indonesia. I think they had made that clear time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Australian Government has a policy which recognises East Timor's incorporation into Indonesia and on a number of occasions in this House I have indicated my opposition to that policy and my total disagreement with it. I do not believe that we, as a country, have a right to give up any other peoples' right to determine their own future and their right to be a sovereign nation. We do not have that right. We would not like it if any other country did that to us and I do not think we have the right to do that to the East Timorese people. However, be that as it may, the Australian Government does have a responsibility to try to ensure that the East Timorese people do have some opportunities to live in peace and freedom within the Indonesian confederation. I have urged the Australian Government on a number of occasions to raise with the Indonesian Government the need to consider some form of autonomous operation for East Timor within the Indonesian confederation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the pending visit of the Australian Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Indonesia, I think it now gives us another opportunity to assert those two fundamental points. One is that Indonesia's control of East Timor for the last 16 years has proven to be a failure and that they need to totally change direction, totally change their policies, remove all their heavy military presence in that province and start bringing about a peaceful existence for the East Timorese people. The second point is that the Indonesian Government needs to give the East Timorese people some autonomous power to control their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not inconsistent with the Australian Government's policy of saying that the Australian Government accepts incorporation. I think that the Indonesian Government can allow the East Timorese to have some semi-independent authority over their own affairs without the constant presence of Indonesian military forces and without the constant intimidation, harassment, beatings and torture that has accompanied that military presence. I would urge the Australian Prime Minister to pursue those two questions with the Indonesian Government in his visit to Indonesia in late April and I also urge the international community to support those measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning the other points that have been outlined in this resolution, the Australian Government and the Australian Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, have worked hard to implement a number of those measures. One of those has been to seek the establishment of an Australian consulate in Dili. We have requested that and have been seeking negotiations with the Indonesian Government on that. That has not yet been achieved but we are hopeful that that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also talking within the United Nations and the broader international community about exerting further pressure on Indonesia to come to the party and to ensure that its human rights record dramatically improves, particularly with regard to differences of political opinion and the rights of people in Indonesia to assert their own political views. I hope that, over time, Indonesia will learn a very strong lesson from the massacre and will recognise that to be accepted in the modern international community it has to recognise the basic rights of people to express their points of view and to be able to live freely. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past, and calls on all Australians to celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears, whose enterprise in the face of adversity helped ensure our prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>I well remember the occasion about 15 years ago when I arrived home late one evening. On the kitchen table was a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Accursed Land</EMPHASIS>, by the author Leonard Bickel. I was weary, but out of interest I picked up the book because it was the story of Sir Douglas Mawson's exploits in the Antarctic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell the story to the House because I well recall that, although I arrived home tired that evening, I could not put that book down. I was captivated by what Mawson had achieved. If there are members in the House who have not read the book, I recommend it to them. Here was a man, desperately ill and alone, without any companions at all. He was suffering&mdash;as everyone now knows, but it was unknown then because of the limitations of medical science&mdash;from vitamin E poisoning. He was making his way back, he hoped, to the ship in the Antarctic. He stumbled into crevasses. He was bleeding, because the vitamin poisoning caused the skin to part from his hands and feet. Anyone could have forgiven him for simply giving up. I was captivated by the book that evening; I did not want to put it down. I discovered a new hero in my life. Here was a man, perpetually wet, perpetually cold, emaciated, but plodding on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been subsequent efforts to denigrate the character of Mawson. But for me his achievement remains something of which every Australian ought to be, and probably is, proud. After I read that book, I thought about the mountains of my own experience. The things that had seemed so impossible to me became molehills in the light of what Mawson had achieved. In fact, I well remember at that stage in my life, as an irrigator, resolving never again to complain about having to clean sprinklers on a frosty night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this story as a backdrop to what I want to say this morning because I think we all need heroes and heroines. We all need to feel a sense of pride in what people have achieved and get a new perspective on what we are trying to achieve in the light of what our forebears have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conducted a random survey of school children in my electorate when I was presenting them with a flag. I asked them who their heroes and heroines were in 1992. I conducted a similar exercise with two of my electorate staff who are Adelaide based. I was a bit disturbed when everybody nominated sporting identities, film stars or pop stars, and I thought it was time we looked again at our Australian past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for my motion this morning is that I think it is time we reassured an emerging generation of Australians that we have a great deal to be proud of and they should recognise that fact. In many cases, we have unintentionally but effectively indoctrinated our children so that they are increasingly apologetic about what happened in Australia in the past. They are wary about lauding former Australian explorers in case they discover that part of what motivated that explorer was some desire for exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems timely to raise this point this morning in the light of a call by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for a greater emphasis on Australian nationalism. I know the Prime Minister is asking us to laud our Australian heroes, but I regret the fact that, because of the nature of the beast, he had to frame it in terms that made us feel apologetic about our past. I endorse his call to laud Australian heroes, but why does he want me also to be critical of those whom he quite unfairly accuses of tugging their forelocks to the British?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole history of Australian military service is something of which we ought to be proud. The Australian military image was built on the fact that Australian service men and women were simply not prepared to tug their forelocks and so got a reputation for individualism, independence and unselfishness. As we move closer to Anzac Day 1992, Australians should be lauding the courage of former Australian service men and women in theatres of war. We should also recognise that in 1992 for an emerging generation of Australian young people the exploits of Australian service men and women, and the exploits of Australian explorers, are something which we should laud and be proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coincidentally, March 1992 marks 90 years since Charles Yelverton O'Connor committed suicide on a Western Australian beach. How many of our school children have ever heard of Charles Yelverton O'Connor, the Australian whose courage, foresight and tenacity built a pipeline&mdash;an engineering feat that had never been achieved before&mdash;from the Kalgoorlie goldfields to Perth; and who, because of the criticism levelled at him, took his own life? We ought to be lauding him as an Australian hero. Instead, we hesitate to acknowledge him in case in some way the project he engineered was environmentally insensitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do school children want to laud pop stars when there are people like Edward John Eyre who, at the age of 20, was here on the Molonglo plains finding a way to drove cattle to South Australia? Then, in the feat for which he became known around the world, he made his way from Adelaide to Perth via the Great Australian Bight and, in the process, almost perished. Australians should be proud of what young Australians have done. We should be pleased to acknowledge it and, in fact, to proclaim it around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of Eyre? Eyre could not have made the journey without the assistance of his Aboriginal companion, Wylie. There was nothing discriminatory about that journey and yet we have hesitated to acknowledge what Eyre has done in case in some way we have to apologise for having intruded into what were, and still are, native lands. In fact, in the whole area of Aboriginal involvement in Australia, Australians tend to be apologetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, things have happened for which we ought to apologise. But the reality is that most of what was done by the early explorers was done with good intentions. For example, we should be applauding the role of the Duracks in north-west Western Australia. We should be applauding those white women who went onto lonely settlements, relied on Aboriginal women to assist them with childbirth, and for whom there was a mutual support mechanism. But we have forgotten that in the note of apology that we have allowed to creep into our account of history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own involvement was a personal association with Elcho Island and Yirrkala before the Whitlam Government. Of course there were mistakes made in those settlements, but the motivation for the people who were there was non-discriminatory and non-exploitative. I think we fail to remember that history, when it looks back on 1992, will find lots of fault with what we as a parliament, with good intention, have done as well. It is time we were prepared to take a pride in Australia's past achievements and time we were prepared to celebrate what has been our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should take an emerging generation of young Australians and give them a sense of optimism about the future instead of so inoculating them with pessimism that they believe that unemployment is something that they will inevitably inherit. It is high time that we recognised our indebtedness to previous generations of Australians. Thanks to them we are richer, freer and wiser than we would otherwise be and we have a heritage of which we may well be proud. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">T<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>hat this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past and calls on all Australians to celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears, whose enterprise in the face of adversity helped ensure our prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA>The speech of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) was very moving and I compliment him on his rhetoric. When he talks about the need for Australian heroes, I agree with him. I sympathise with his description of Australian soldiers, good soldiers, often badly deployed in imperial strategic interests. I sympathise with his statements about our explorers, the way in which they opened up this great continent; the railway makers who have laid down the routes from which our national economy was constructed; and the people who opened up the cattle routes for the movement of livestock around the country. I appreciate all the sentiments he puts forward and I applaud the way in which he has put them. But there was another side to the development of this great country of ours. The honourable member has moved that this House abhors the emerging sense of apology about our past and, while I concur with the sentiment, I think it is put a bit too strongly for me to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go too far in the direction that the honourable member for Wakefield proposes, we acquire an historical sense which used to be called the triumphal school of history, or history of the greats, or the history of the evolution of the present as one of triumphal progress unimpeded by a darker side. It is all too easy to write this kind of history and for much of the early part of the twentieth century the school texts of this country were dominated by that kind of history&mdash;the names of the Governors of New South Wales and of the monarchs of England in succession with the ever rising tide of progress and empire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first arrived at the Australian National University in the early 1960s, I jumped into the middle of a countervailing school of thought that was known, I suppose, as the labour school of history. It argued that, if one took merely the greats&mdash;the governors, the monarchs, the named explorers, the notable engineers, the Mawsons, all of whom played their part in the evolution of this great country&mdash;one ignored the role of the great mass of the Australian population, laying down fences in order to keep the sheep runs confined, going about their daily business of constructing houses, roads, settlements and the day-to-day activities of ordinary Australian people constructing this great nation. If one merely concentrates on heroes, explorers, generals and governors, one misses this underlying social fabric of movement, of progress, of construction, and the creation of a national identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those people that I befriended at the Australian National University, it might be said, went in another sort of direction which provided much of the underpinning for the ALP version of Australian history which I first experienced, as I said, a quarter of a century ago. They wrote about the role of organised labour from the 1890s onwards in the construction of a regulated Australian economy and society that were unique in the world&mdash;uniquely progressive, uniquely egalitarian, uniquely regulated and uniquely democratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came to the view at that time, as did most people on this side of the House, I dare say, that in regard to this great tradition&mdash;which can be epitomised in the title of a book that I read a couple of years ago&mdash;we `civilised capitalism'. The role of the Australian people in the development of Australia was to make it unique by civilising the capitalist system of economic development and process that Australia had adopted. It had done so in a way that made Australia a unique phenomenon on the face of the earth&mdash;uniquely democratic, earlier so than anywhere else, and uniquely regulated, with basic wages, tariffs to protect it against external competition, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the predominant debate when I became a scholar at the Australian National University: the triumphal school of history that, broadly speaking, those on the other side of the House adopted; and the labour history which, broadly speaking, those on this side of the House adopted. I think we can now look back on both of them as being inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 20 years that I have resided in Adelaide I have watched a different kind of historical perspective emerge which one might call apologetic&mdash;in the sense that the honourable member abhors in his motion&mdash;that involves a reassessment of the role of the development of the Australian nation and which, to some degree, it seems to me, not only corrects the deficiencies of the traditional labour history and the traditional triumphal history but also tends to exaggerate some of the deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me run through a few of these matters to show why I cannot support the word `abhors'. Over the last 20-odd years, for example, the impact on Aboriginal society of white settlement of this great continent has become more clearly appreciated. The first volume that I read in this context that had a huge impact on me was the third volume of the trilogy by C. D. Rowley on Aboriginal society which was called, from memory, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Destruction of Aboriginal Society</EMPHASIS>. It had a huge impact on many intellectuals, with the realisation of the extensive damage that had been done to the Aboriginal people, who have been here for 40,000 to 50,000 years. We now have an appreciation that his description was in itself inadequate in so far as it talked about a passive Aboriginal civilisation being crushed by European colonisers. We now have a much better appreciation of the resistance that they put up and the degree of survival of that Aboriginal civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another school of thought emerged, I suppose, first with Humphrey McQueen's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The New Britannia</EMPHASIS> on the way in which the labour school of history had in itself been idealistic and rather deficient in its description of the way in which labour had civilised capitalism and some of its own deficiencies. I dare say that that springs back to the volume by V. Gordon Childs, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">How Labour Governs</EMPHASIS>. We now have a better appreciation of the role of women, both positive in the sense of their contribution and negative in the sense of their oppressed role in the development of Australian civilisation, which started with the origins of feminist history. I suppose that began with Anne Summers' book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Damned Whores and God's Police</EMPHASIS>. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can acknowledge the same kind of appreciation of the impact on the environment, of the evolution of gay society, notably in Sydney, the impact of British imperial economic connections on the development of the Australian economy, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a point about these critical histories that have developed over the last 20 years and which have had their impact on the school system, as the honourable member quite rightly says, and on popular journalism. I suppose one might refer in this regard to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Fatal Shore</EMPHASIS>, which was so popular, written by Robert Hughes, about the nature of convict society and its contribution to the evolution of the Australian economy. The point I want to make is this: while it is true that we have constructed in Australia a unique civilisation that has unique, positive attributes that make it, for many of us, one of the most desirable places in which to live and, if not a perfect society, one with attributes that make it preferable to any other that we have experienced, we still have to recognise that it has downsides. The contributions that these people that I have described have made is to alert us to those downsides and to attract us as politicians to a recognition of their continuation and, if that be the case, to devise legislative means for rectifying the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one has to take progress as being a two-sided thing. On the one side it has undoubtedly occurred but on the other side people have been damaged in the process of progress and we as legislators need to take heed of those downsides and try to do something about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I note a couple of things. One is that each generation will write its own history, will look into its own past, to find what is important and attractive and unattractive for it, and it will seek to do something about the present in the light of that past. I note that more recently two very basic pillars of our society which have previously not received perhaps the critical appreciation that they deserve have come under such criticism&mdash;the family and the church. I suppose in 20 years time if I were giving this speech, I would be adding them to the critical appreciation of the Australian past. In the meantime, I certainly agree that we should celebrate the proud achievements of our forebears but we should do so in full recognition of the downsides that were often incurred in the process of the evolution of this great nation. </PARA>

<PARA>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak in support of this important motion now before the House. I heartily endorse the sentiments of the honourable member for Wakefield and I thank him most sincerely for moving this motion. I am sorry I have not got time to respond to the comments made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley). I am not suggesting that I disagree with everything he said at all, but I think that we are in a day and an age when we need to be much more positive about our past achievements and the effect that they will have in building up morale and a better spirit in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent grievance debate a couple of weeks ago I took great pleasure in highlighting the rich and colourful nature of our Australian heritage. I called on fellow Australians to cherish our past achievements and preserve those aspects of our heritage that identify us as true Australians. I must say that there was a lot of positive response throughout the nation to that speech, from the ABC and from the media generally. Unfortunately this period seems to be increasingly ignored by our educational system and by many bodies which ought to be doing more about bringing it to the attention of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a glorious past which is filled with stories of triumph over hardship, suffering and sacrifice. It is an unsurpassed story of determination, perseverance and high achievement. These stories are of men and women who love this country and their fellow Australians, believing passionately in this country's future. They were men and women who were always ready to defend the principles of freedom and free speech and willingly have risked their lives for these very principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They bravely fought and died for this nation to ensure that future generations enjoyed the freedoms that they enjoyed. If we were to leave this chamber and visit the nearby War Memorial we would find ample testimony to this fact. The memorabilia of the Vietnam conflict and our involvement does, however, remind us of our need to apologise to those who served in that war for our treatment of them on their return.I am not in any way or any sense trying to laud war. I am just mentioning, as the member for Wakefield did, that we have to take on board these great achievements and, in many instances, the payment of the supreme sacrifice by our fellow Australians in giving us a great character as Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield mentioned Anzac Day. I well remember&mdash;almost from my earliest memories&mdash;my father, who was a World War I veteran, getting me up very early in the morning and making sure that I accompanied him to the dawn service so that I could be reminded of what I owed to those who fought so bravely to keep our freedom going. I am glad to be able to say that there has hardly been a dawn service over the years that I have missed and I am now taking my own children to these services to inculcate in them these memories that must never be forgotten and which have built a great nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to say that the attendance at Anzac Day services in past years is on the increase. This is not because people are apologetic about the past; they are proud of the fact that so many Australian men and women fought and many died to keep this nation free and make it the great nation that it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the clearest and most recent examples of the Australian spirit and unity, just to come back to recent times in this country, is seen in the events following the Nyngan floods. Not only were the people of Nyngan determined to get on with their lives and build anew, but people from right round Australia willingly came forward, devoting time, skills, money and goods to restore their town to its former condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further, even more dramatic example was the demonstration in events that followed Cyclone Tracy. On Christmas morning 1974 with wind speeds of more than 217 kilometres an hour, Cyclone Tracy almost destroyed that city in our far north. Ninety per cent of the buildings in the city were destroyed. Fifty people died and many more were reported missing. Water, electricity, sanitation and communication services were severely disrupted and more than three-quarters of the population were evacuated to other parts of Australia. Not deterred by all of that, the people of Darwin returned and reconstructed the city within a few short years. By 1981 the last available land had been developed and the planning focus was shifted to Palmerston, 20 kilometres south of Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly&mdash;and there are many more examples&mdash;we cannot forget the united Australian spirit that was exhibited following the disastrous Newcastle earthquakes. Again, amidst hardship and suffering, the people of Newcastle showed the rest of the world that Australians are not easily deterred. I recall just a couple of weeks ago attending the Lord Mayors prayer breakfast in the city of Newcastle, at which 1,000 people congregated at 7.30 in the morning to bring that city together and to `Break Free', as the theme was that morning, from all the limitations and the negativisms that are seemingly abounding in that city&mdash;or have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this country of ours is indeed a country of spirited, hardworking, loyal and patriotic people, a united people who have believed in the future and have overcome obstacles of distance, extreme climatic conditions and natural disaster to build the Australia of today&mdash;a great and wonderful country. Tragically, however, these same high-spirited, determined people are today being bombarded with feelings of guilt from a government which seems ashamed of our past and is desperately trying to bring about a new national identity. Those who are supposed to unite this beautiful country have ridiculed and scoffed at those who feel we can be proud of our heritage. Their recent attacks on the Australian flag, calling for social and mental transformation of the populace, are an example of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who openly pay tribute to the monarchy that has faithfully served this country for the past 200 years are told that they are living in the past and that their concept of the future is going back down a time tunnel to the 1950s to Astor televisions and so on&mdash;not that there was anything wrong with those sets. That is a great insult, I believe, to all genuine Aussies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What justification is there for encouraging an attitude of apology for our past? We have made mistakes and we must learn by our mistakes, as both the member for Wakefield and the member for Adelaide have said. We must look to the future with constructive optimism, not dwell on the past and blame our ancestors, our early settlers, for the problems we encounter today. Instead of honestly and frankly admitting that he is the architect of Australia's present economic problems, even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is suggesting that our mental attitude is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only endorse the recent reported comments of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he remarked that the campaign against the flag was to make Australians abandon their national heritage, turn their backs on their history and remodel Australia as a cold, austere, soulless and technocratic state without traditions, heritage or history. I am appalled at this blatant campaign which encourages this sense of apology for our past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those apology campaigners have shown this House that they hate our flag, the monarchy and the British. They are ashamed of our heritage and they give the impression that they hold the United States of America, New Zealand, Japan and others of our neighbours in contempt. And yet they project themselves as typifying the loyal patriotic Australians of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I ask members of this House who has the problem: the people of Australia or the proponents of this negative campaign? I encourage all those who have been associated with these un-Australian sentiments to reconsider their position and turn away from this campaign that can only bring disunity to a nation with a proven, united and spirited people. I believe that it is the Government which suffers from the identity crisis, not the Australian people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened today to the other speakers and, sadly, this is not the great country they speak of, this is not the great and proud nation we should be. We should be that but we are not, and we are not because of our own shortcomings. I think we must ask why this has come about. It is nothing new; it has been in Australia for a long time. I would like to quote from one of my own publications, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Great Challenge</EMPHASIS>, which is in fact about this very subject. The quote is from Randolf Bedford in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nought to Thirty-three</EMPHASIS>. This is turn of the century stuff. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was not an animal pest, scarcely a vegetable pest; fools and the old world supplied them all. . . the complacent reception of them was only part of the inferiority complex of the Australian; accepting the domination of lesser men because they came from afar and lied boldly.</PARA>
<PARA>This is part of the problem we have had in Australia. There has always been a section in this community that has felt the need to genuflect to somebody else, to denigrate our own history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that today as clearly as we have seen it in the past. The difference today is to whom they genuflect. There was a time when we used to kowtow to the British and see in the British something which we should aspire to. We, with the utmost haste, kicked them out in the mid-1960s and embraced the Americans. We cut ourselves free from the British apron string and tied ourselves firmly to the American apron string, and it is the same people today that want to cut free from America and tie us onto North-East Asia, or particularly Japan. These are the advocates of the Garnaut doctrine of the North-East Asian ascendancy. It is a very dangerous thing because there is no future for Australia except as a nation proud and confident in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told by fools that we are part of Asia. Australia is not part of Asia. We are indeed further from Asia than a lot of European cities are. We are further from Africa than Britain is. Does anyone suggest that Britain is part of Africa? Asia is in the northern hemisphere. That is not to denigrate Asia; it offers us trade potential, but it is not the only trade potential and a lot of our potential must exist in the high earning capacity countries, the high disposable income nations of northern Europe. It is interesting to note that our exports to northern Europe have increased some 400 per cent over the last five years, all of which entered Europe through the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing today is an attempt to re-write Australia's history. We have actually heaped praise upon some of these latter day historians who have simply distorted our past. I quote from another of my publications, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Australian Retrospective</EMPHASIS>. I felt the necessity, along with Mark Uhlmann, to write a short history of Australia to try to put it back into perspective and to show the people of Australia, the children of Australia particularly, that this country has a past of which we can be very proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can this argument be maintained and how can this knowledge be instilled in children when there are people like Archbishop Hollingworth, citizen of the year? I was driving my car on Christmas Eve, I think it was, and I had to stop the car. I was so angry. Archbishop Hollingworth was saying, on the radio, that we ought to be grateful for Aboriginals because they have 40,000 years of culture and we have none. This is what the man said. He said how great it would be if we could all go to London, sit in a pub there and talk in an Aboriginal language, so that the pommies could not understand us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of points about that. Firstly, if we spoke in English they probably would not understand us. Secondly, why would we want to do it, anyway? What an aspiration! The truth is that we have a culture in this country, a culture we inherited. It is a culture which is not perfect. No culture is. But it is a culture that is a very proud culture that can hold its head up anywhere at any time in history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have built upon that. We have added significantly to it. What has Australia done? Australia was the country that produced the concept of the eight-hour day. It was Australia that first introduced full adult franchise; one of the first countries to give votes to women, 23 years ahead of Britain and only just pipped by New Zealand because it had an election earlier than we did. Australia was the country that developed the Torrens land title system, the most equitable form of land ownership in the world, slowly spreading across the United Kingdom some 80-odd years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country has a proud history. It may be interesting to note that Mark Twain, when he was out here on a lecture tour in the early 1900s, said that Australia has a history so marvellous that it reads like a fairytale but it is all true. Here was a country that had managed to unite itself without the bloodshed that the United States suffered. Here was a country that had achieved a sense of unity, peaceably, and had come together in a Federal-State relationship through negotiation. There were tremendous pressures trying to divide the country in those days but unity was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the motive of these people who denigrate Australia?  I can tell honourable members now that the basis of the motive is multiculturalism. This is the issue that is gnawing at the heart of Australia today. Multiculturalism is a policy which has been imposed on the Australian people. In all fairness, I should say that it was probably first promulgated by Al Grassby&mdash;I think that should be recommendation enough&mdash;certainly introduced by Malcolm Fraser and endorsed by us in our turn. It was introduced in the belief that migrants can be manipulated for their votes. What a racist suggestion that migrants are somehow more stupid than Australians and more easy to manipulate. It is not true. The truth today is rich Italians, Greeks, or whomever, vote for honourable members opposite, the poor ones vote for us. That is the basis of the voting pattern. We do not manipulate by controlling or speaking to some of their leaders. What an absurd suggestion!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is that these people are rewriting Australia's history so that they can start with a clean sheet. It is their desire to take away the culture of the past. The republican movement in Australia, once the ground of the dissident Irish and the Anglo-Saxon intellectuals, is now being taken over by the multiculturalists. Its agenda is not a nationalist Australia; its agenda is to wipe clean those planks of Anglo-Celtic culture so they can have a clean sheet of paper on which to write their own history of Australia, a country, which Archbishop Hollingworth says, has no culture. This is exactly what is happening and the people of Australia must realise this before it is too late. </PARA>

Australia was a big, open, empty country. It was going to be taken by somebody. You want to thank your lucky stars it was taken by the British because, if it had been taken by some other people, you would not be here to be complaining'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House deplores attacks by the Prime Minister on the Australian Monarch, our monarchical system of parliamentary democracy and the World War II British cabinet and military command.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, once upon a time we had a quiet and sensible debate regarding the future of the monarchy in Australia, our monarchical system of parliamentary democracy, our Australian flag and whether or not any or all of these institutions require change. Today the quiet and sensible debate has given way to irrational diatribe, as dogma replaces intelligent comment. In truth, the issue of republicanism is little more than a diversionary tactic by a Prime Minister frightened to defend his actions in bringing on the mother of all recessions and his statement of no hope entitled One Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We Australians face a grim future if we do not get on with repairing our broken economy. Our priority should be to address the structural reform so necessary to our economic good health, lest we leave our children a debased inheritance. We need not have this debate today, but the handball of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot go unchallenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this motion, I will set out the proposition that I believe in and support our particular form of parliamentary democracy, based on an Australian monarch as head of state and our federal Constitution to encapsulate the mores of our political system and define areas of responsibility in a peculiar form of writing known as English. Clearly, the Prime Minister, in attacking our monarch, has attacked Australia, has set loose forces of divisiveness and division designed to create not one nation but one job for one man, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Our Prime Minister apparently believes that we compromise our identity by acknowledging our history, our past and our heritage. Like a dreamer who would make himself into that which he is not, the Prime Minister denies our history and would have us be something which we are not in order to become his true Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true cultural cringe would be to deny our past, to pretend to be that which we are not and which we have never been, in order to curry favour with new friends and new acquaintances. A real nation, a grown-up nation, does not change its constitution or its mechanisms of government just because it has changed its trading partners. This business of constitutional change is indeed serious stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's assertion, `I'm Australian', is a statement of fact and I will today, as an immigrant to this great nation, as a new Australian, make the same statement of fact. I am also an Australian. But the honourable member for Blaxland wishes to deny his roots, his association through the past with Great Britain. I wish not to deny my roots and believe that others would accept as a sign of maturity my understanding and my love of my roots and my heritage. I have accepted the welcoming arms of a new nation and a new culture which has subsumed my identity but which has not taken from me the reality of my past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud of where I came from and what I am. Only an individual with a giant inferiority complex would deny his birthright to score a cheap political point, and it is obvious to all who care to listen that the honourable member for Blaxland has denied his roots, denied his heritage and denied his country. Dumping on Great Britain in order to divert attention from issues of substance is a blatant act of cowardice. Our monarch, by tradition, cannot publicly defend herself but depends on those of us who believe in the monarchy to provide such defence. Attempting to deny that Great Britain founded our nation, and bequeathed us our system of law and our Constitution, is at best silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support our system of parliamentary democracy on two levels, one practical and one emotional. On a practical level, Australia has the sixth longest serving democratic parliamentary system in the world, uninterrupted by military takeover or dictatorship. Only the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Switzerland and Sweden can claim longer terms of uninterrupted democracy. Four of those six nations have incorporated a monarchy as their head of State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is clearly a very old country in terms of our system of government and we exhibit a political stability which is admired by the rest of the world. Our Constitution and our monarchy have served Australia well. There is an old adage, `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. On an emotional level, I swore allegiance to the Queen of Australia because I wanted to vote for those individuals who are going to represent me in State and Federal parliaments. Gough Whitlam made a good fist of messing up my business life and I wanted to vote for the Party which would pick the Prime Minister to replace him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I swore allegiance to my Queen but I did not deny my birthright. The Consul-General of the United States of America, however, had other priorities and did not hesitate to strip from me my citizenship, to declare that I had expatriated myself, and the consequence was uniform loss of nationality. On a very personal and emotional level, I support the Queen, and yet an ancestor of mine seven generations ago signed a document known as the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America. I support the Queen as our head of state and will treat her with the utmost respect. If anyone in this place has the credentials to support a republic it would be me, but in all the current circumstances I do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has attempted to link our future economic commitment to South East Asia with republicanism. To make such a connection is like saying that one can only relate to the South Pole if one wears fur or feathers. Perhaps our new Prime Minister&mdash;the one we had to have&mdash;will now, in order to curry favour for external trade, become a furry feather-wearer. That same Prime Minister stated that during World War II Britain decided not to defend the Malay Peninsula, not to worry about Singapore. From my reading of history, Britain did defend Singapore, to the limit of its available resources and in the circumstances at the time. Two major British ships were sunk and many tens of thousands of British troops were either killed or taken as prisoners of war by the Japanese. His blatant attempt to rewrite history to serve his own cheap political diversionary tactic is not the act of a statesman but that of a schoolyard bully who would try to win the argument with force or bluster rather than logic or reasoned debate. The Prime Minister not only denigrates what it means to be an Australian but has proved himself to be a rather inferior military historian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to our flag, the flag of Australia is the symbol of our national identity which sets us apart from other nations. That symbol has been proudly carried by millions of Australians in sporting events around the world, at international conferences and, not least importantly, in many foreign wars. Those Australians who have placed their lives on the line for their country, who have placed nation above self, both the quick and the dead, will not thank us if we tamper with the symbol&mdash;our flag&mdash;that represents our nationhood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said by this Prime Minister that our flag represents another cultural cringe to Great Britain because it contains the crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick. The flag of South Africa contains those crosses in forms of the Union Jack, as does the flag of New Zealand, and I am not advised of any move by citizens of those nations to decry their heritage or change their flag. The State flag of Hawaii, now a State in the United States of America, contains those same three crosses. And the citizens of Hawaii would fight to retain their flag. </PARA>

It is a distortion of the truth and it is being used by the conservative parties in this Parliament to launch an unwarranted attack on the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a cartoon in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showing two people&mdash;one a fellow with a newspaper saying, `Popularity Hewson down', the other, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) carrying a dead cat with `GST' on it and saying, `But why?'. I would suggest that the cartoonist, Moir, could start a series in which the next cartoon could show the dead tariff turkey, because as the people of Australia listen to the policies that the Opposition is pursuing on tariffs, those policies will become a dead turkey that will smell and bring the Leader of the Opposition's popularity down. Such a series of cartoons could also then go to the dead monarchy mouse, because it is another example of what is going to bring the Opposition down. It is something that the people of this country will simply not accept as presented in the way that the Opposition is presenting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public comments by the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Opposition demonstrate just how much the Liberal and National parties are now out of touch with the attitudes and sentiments of Australian people, especially young Australians. Those parties really lack an understanding of what people really want for their country. They are blind to the innate desire of the vast majority of Australians, who want to be truly an independent nation. They do not want to be British, they do not want to be American, they do not want to be Asian; they want to be Australian. That is something the Opposition has not understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion moved by the honourable member for La Trobe is typical of the half-hearted Australians in the conservative parties who long for the old imperial days, who have some sort of dream about a great British Empire, who see themselves one day on bended knee receiving a knighthood and who, like the old English working class, would pull at the forelock as they bowed to the squires and the lords of the manor. That is the past, and Opposition members want to go back to it. Amazing, quite amazing!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is also part of the saga of misrepresentation by the Opposition as to what the Prime Minister said when Her Majesty the Queen was here. But the people are not fooled. He did not attack the monarchy, he did not attack the Queen of this country, Queen Elizabeth. He has instead simply stated a fact of life, a reality of the now, and that is that Australia ought to be an independent nation. At no time was the Prime Minister offensive, nor was he rude, nor was he discourteous to our Queen. Instead he was the opposite. He said, and I quote from the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is with great pleasure that I welcome you to Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say to Her Majesty:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is my primary purpose to congratulate you on the 40th anniversary of your accession to the throne.</PARA>
<PARA>He thanked her for her visit. What he said and what he did was correct, it was proper, and it was courteous. In the crowds, again something the Liberals have tried to highlight as something that was wrong, at all times the Prime Minister was conscious of his responsibility to the monarch. He introduced her to people whom he knew she would find interesting. He also introduced her or directed her to people that she already knew&mdash;ex-Prime Ministers and others. Yet the Opposition tries to make out that he did something wrong by placing his hand gently and courteously behind her in directing her amongst the people. That is an Australian way, and if honourable members opposite want to cast it aside let them do so at their peril politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Prime Minister did was to make the Queen extremely welcome. He also stood up for this country. As the transcript clearly shows, he pointed out that we are different nations. We are two different generations because of the time that has passed since the Queen first visited this country. He said that just as Britain has looked to Europe, and correctly so, Australia needs to look at its own region, and rightly so. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As our constitutional relationships has evolved so have the circumstances of our economic and political lives.</PARA>

When those second and third generation miners from Cornwall, England, Ireland and Scotland came up from underground, I am sure they had the greatest respect for the Queen, even though they were socialists. I am very disappointed by what has happened here today and by the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of what this is about. The Prime Minister has obviously done some polling. He has found that at least 50 to 60 per cent of the people living in Australia today were either not born here or their parents were not born here. Because of the economic situation in which we find ourselves, he has taken us on a flight of fancy. He thinks that by doing so he is going to divert the attention of the people from what is happening in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party over the past several years has used key words. One was`compassion'. Any party less likely to have compassion one could not name. Of course now it is tugging the forelock. It says, `We do not want to tug the forelock to Britain, we do not want to tug the forelock to the Queen' and so on. But this motion really just shows what our cultural cringe is. We are proud to be Australian, we are proud of our background, proud of our history. We do not have to bow down or kowtow to anyone. But if we know that, why do we have to keep saying it? Is it some sort of expression of our cultural cringe that we have to go out wearing a T-shirt with `I love Australia' or `I am not afraid of anyone' on it? To me, this stand that the Prime Minister is taking is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an evolving political situation in Australia. It may be that one day we will be a republic, it may be that one day we will change the flag. But the people in Australia today are not concerned about that. What they are concerned about is the one million unemployed. The Prime Minister can go on, do anything, say anything, as we know he is used to doing, but that does not change the argument. After eight years in the job of Treasurer, this country has been absolutely wrecked. Now this Prime Minister is in a position where he can do worse damage. We have heard some of the statements he has made. And he changes from day to day. This is the man who was attacking McEwenism, particularly the National Party&mdash;McEwenism and protectionism; the worst thing that could have come to this country was protectionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday on his VIP flight down to Melbourne, apparently, like St Paul, he had a conversion. Although St Paul was struck blind in his conversion, the Prime Minister was blind to the economic situation in Australia before he got onto the plane. When he got down there and got amongst the workers he said, `I had better support protectionism here. We will change our policy overnight and now protectionism is a good word'. This is what we are used to. He will say anything, he will do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would like him to do is start talking about jobs. We see the rest of the world jumping on the band wagon and starting to trade with South Africa. Where are we? Behind the eight-ball. Why? Because he tugs the forelock to his leftie mates. That is what it is all about. Why does he not do something about our trade with Taiwan, our policies on Taiwan and other countries? Because he is tugging the forelock to his leftie mates. That is what it is all about. We in this country saw the bad manners displayed to the Queen. When Ceausescu was here a few years ago everyone was racing around kowtowing to him. We have had Mandela, we have had people from China and Russia over the years. I do not hear them saying anything about those people. But for some reason or other we are attacking the Queen. I just cannot understand this mentality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest crime of the lot of course is what this Prime Minister has done to the workers of this country. That is what this motion is all about, trying to hide the facts from the people of Australia, trying to get on the band wagon people who really do not understand what is happening, trying to say to them, `Look, we need a republic, we need to change the flag, we dislike the Queen' and so on.

This woman would be better off if her husband were unemployed. He works for the local council on the garbage truck, he gets a reasonable salary, but if he were unemployed now she would be far better off. She could get the health care card.

But I believe it is important in this debate, and in the debate that will rage on in this nation for quite some time, to point out those facts. I admire and respect the courage of British soldiers, the British naval and air force personnel, but I do not respect some of the idiots like Haig and Hamilton, the High Command during World War I, who butchered our soldiers at Fromelles and Pozieres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I wish to raise serious matters and concerns about the performance record of the Environment Protection Authority, the EPA, in Victoria. A Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> article of 3 November last year did say that Victoria is better off overall for the efforts of the EPA which now in its twenty-first year employs over 300 staff and has a budget of $20.7 million. However, a three-week investigation by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> also came to the following disquieting conclusions, and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> article:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of prosecutions has dropped from 50 to 31 in the past year, while the level of infringement notices on industry has been cut from 641 to 341 over the past two years. This suggests either greater environmental awareness among businesses or less EPA vigilance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPA received more than $1m in donations from major industry associations in the past year, prompting charges from some sectors that the relationship between the polluters and the pollution watchdog had become too cosy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The monitoring of industry pollution is left largely to industry. This system of self-monitoring relies too much on mutual trust and could be exploited, say EPA critics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proceeds from industry levies in the year ended June were $2.8m below earlier estimates. Though the Authority was restricted by political manoeuvring, critics say the EPA is generally a poor money gatherer.</PARA>
<PARA>The article concluded with a comment by a senior public servant that the EPA has not quite outlived its usefulness, `but it does lack a vision. . . what needs to happen is a more open debate about the future'. A more open debate about the EPA's abysmal record in controlling the dumping of waste oil in northern Victoria is certainly needed. Freedom of information documents I have recently obtained from the EPA, press articles and other information substantiate this concern. This concern is highlighted in a series of incidents that are known to have taken place since 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the winter of that year, approximately 35 acres of that year's harvest of peaches and plums were destroyed after the application of waste oil, supposedly to kill blight on the leaves of the trees in Turnbull Bros orchards at Shepparton. The Turnbull orchard is a major supplier, I might add, to Ardmona fruits. The oil was provided by M. Hall and Sons of Ardmona who in turn obtained their supplies from Worth Environmental Ltd, of 92 Ordish Road, Dandenong South. Though there was no analysis of the oil concerned on this occasion, clearly there was something seriously amiss with the oil to cause such a dramatic wipe-out of a crop. EPA Melbourne was advised of the offences and parties involved, but I understand that no further action was taken. The offences were essentially related to the failure by Worth to provide the relevant documentation; that is, the waste transport certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out, for the information of the House, that a waste transport certificate consists of three parts: part A&mdash;generator, part B&mdash;transport, and part C&mdash;receiver. Failure to complete certification carries a maximum penalty of $10,000. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years after these peculiar events, at 1.40 a.m. on 28 July 1991, a tanker owned by Drake Haulage Pty Ltd, of 25 Lusty Street, Arncliffe, New South Wales, hit the bridge at Nathalia. Approximately 3,000 litres of the tanker's load of 26,000 litres of waste oil spilled into the Broken Creek, which is part of the Murray River system. At the time, the tanker was travelling from Bendigo to its consignment destination at Worth Oil Pty Ltd, in Windsor, New South Wales, Worth Oil having also commissioned the vehicle. The oil had been collected by Rick and Sue Bell Pty Ltd of Bendigo, who collect waste sump oil around the area and send it to Worth Oil in Sydney where it is refined for reuse. Subsequent investigation by the EPA indicated that Bells had completed the appropriate waste transport certificate but, again, there was no documentation in relation to Worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ricky Bell, when interviewed by the EPA, said that Bob Cooper of Worth, Sydney, Worth Managing Director, David Dunworth, and Pat Davern of Worth, Melbourne, had all told him that as the oil was `burning fluid', certificates were not required to cart it. Offences were obviously committed by Bells, Drake Haulage and Worth. The FOI documents show that penalty notices were issued subsequently by the EPA against Bells and Drake, but again there was no action against Worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the use of waste oil as a winter oil spray is a significant environmental problem in the Goulburn irrigation region, so, it must also be pointed out, is its use as a dust suppressant. In fact, a letter of 5 June 1991 from Mr Carl Schaller of the EPA to the Chief General Manager of the Department of Agriculture refers to both these problems as being `widespread in the district'. Other FOI documents obtained from the EPA support this contention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again a piously expressed EPA concern is not matched by appropriate action. Only two months after the letter referred to was written, a complaint was received that a local orchardist had arranged for over one kilometre of government road near Toolamba to be oiled as a dust suppressant. It is believed that Worth in Melbourne provided approximately 30,000 litres of waste oil for this purpose. The EPA is understood to have taken no action against Worth over this incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parallel situation arose in Riverview Drive in Shepparton on 29 October last year, when another orchardist dumped 20,000 litres of waste oil as a dust suppressant. The incident was reported extensively on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shepparton News</EMPHASIS> of 31 October and 1 November. It is understood Worth was again involved, but I will decline to comment in detail on this specific incident, as the EPA informs me that it is still being investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been other incidents involving Worth, which is notorious for its practice of moving tankers with 20,000 to 30,000 litres of waste oil from Melbourne for dumping in and around the Shepparton area. An analysis of the waste sump oil shows that it contains industrial waste, including chloroform and other dangerous substances. Waste transport certificates are not completed by Worth and no charge is made for the waste oil, it being supplied under the guise of a free service. The financial benefit to Worth of this illegal activity is easy to calculate. As I understand, it costs about 20c a litre to legally dispose of waste oil. A tanker with a 30,000-litre capacity would entail a total disposal cost of $6,000 or below for a less than full capacity load. Given that the delivery cost from Melbourne to Shepparton would be approximately $1,000, the gain per trip to Worth could be up to $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding with a number of critical questions for the EPA and the Victorian Government, I indicate that the State Manager at Worth in Dandenong, Mr Pat Davern, is a former EPA area coordinator who drafted the Worth licence. Worth Dandenong also has another former EPA employee running its incinerator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of the goods and services tax is set to be rejected by the Australian people more intensely and with more ferocity than any other political issue since the Vietnam war. No-one will be left untouched by this iniquitous tax. Every Australian will be compelled to pay this loathsome tax if Dr Hewson wins the next Federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to many of my constituents that the debate on the goods and services tax thus far has been concerned primarily with the vantage point of people living in metropolitan Australia. Whilst their fears are well founded, the effects of the goods and services tax on people living in northern Australia would be much more harsh. A recent paper by a distinguished Australian economist, Professor Percy Harris of James Cook University of North Queensland, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Goods and Services Tax and Interregional Equity</EMPHASIS>, has provided a number of examples that people living in regional Australia would bear a heavier burden of tax and cost increase from the imposition of the GST than would people living in metropolitan Australia. Professor Harris said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With GST of 15 %, the cost of a basket of goods and services (assuming it does not contain zero rated or exempt commodities) which costs $400 in Brisbane (before GST) will rise by $60 in Brisbane. However, in remote areas like Darwin, Mt Isa and Port Hedland, where the same basket of commodities costs, say, $480 (before GST), the cost will rise by $72. This additional $12 GST paid for the same basket of commodities is a basis for inter-regional equity considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GST will be offset in part by a reduction in other taxes. A closely related tax, the wholesale sales tax, will be abolished. Twenty years ago this would have been of benefit to Northern Australia but today so much wholesaling is done in the capital cities that the effect will not be very much greater in Northern Australia than in The Rest of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly the abolition of excise duties on petroleum products will mean price reductions much the same everywhere in Australia, but its replacement by GST will mean a tax addition that will be higher in remote areas where petrol prices are higher (because of transport costs). However, lower fuel prices may lead to lower prices in the North, although on past evidence commodity prices in the North rise with increases in fuel prices, but do not fall when fuel prices fall . . . firms paying less excise on petroleum products and less payroll tax may take the opportunity to boost profits and not pass on the tax cuts in full . . . transport costs may not fall as much as the decline in fuel prices . . . Also, there are good reasons to argue that GST will increase prices more in Northern Australia and other remote areas than in the populous metropolitan areas, because of higher prices for consumer goods and services on which GST is levied. Tinkering around the edges of the Zone rebate scheme, as is proposed in the reform package, will do little to offset this impact.</PARA>
<PARA>As details of the Fightback package become better known, there is rising fear and opposition to the goods and services tax at every level of Australian society. One particular industry in north Queensland that will be savaged by the GST is the tourism industry. For many years tourist operators in Queensland have opposed the introduction of a bed tax. The goods and services tax is an implicit bed tax which tourists, both domestic and international, will be forced to pay. As Professor Harris has pointed out, the 15 per cent tax will also apply to meals, travel, films, film processing and many other items which are essential to the profitability of the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is now Australia's major foreign exchange earner. The tourism industry earned $7.3 billion last year for Australia, which was more than any other industry. Approximately 2.4 million tourists arrived in Australia&mdash;7 per cent more than in 1990. That was despite the Gulf war. Why is it then that the coalition refuses to zero rate the tourism industry under the goods and services tax? This decision to double tax the tourism industry is perverse, inexplicable and boneheaded. It goes against all logic. It goes against the principles of successful business practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The call by tourism chiefs to zero rate the goods and services tax as it applies to the tourism industry has been ignored by the coalition. The chief executive officers of Australia's tourism industry have reminded the coalition again and again that the Australian tourism industry is the best economic prospect that Australia currently possesses. Tourism is also the world's number one growth industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question without notice on Tuesday this week, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) cited the Swedish experience of proposing a goods and services tax on tourism. In 1990 Sweden broadened its value added tax to include tourism services and, as a consequence, it suffered a massive 13 per cent fall in bed night numbers. The new Swedish Government was forced to reduce the value added rate with effect from 1 January of this year because of its adverse effect on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most OECD countries provide concessional VAT rates for tourism services such as hotels, restaurants and domestic travel. The Liberal and National parties' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback! </EMPHASIS>document ignores overseas experience and applies the goods and services tax to tourism at the full rate. It is astonishing, to say the least, that the coalition is persisting with its determination to tax tourism to the hilt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of Australia's leading tourist industry bodies, the Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia, has roundly criticised the goods and services tax proposal and in particular the failure of the Liberal and National parties to zero-rate inbound tourism. A leading Australian tourism development manager, who has recently been involved in negotiations to develop a new $170m international hotel in one of Australia's leading tourist destinations, has had the nightmare of a goods and services tax as it applies to the tourist industry brought home to him very forcibly by the international consortium associated with the project. The development manager claimed that he was astonished that the negotiators representing the hotel operator demanded that provision be made in the management agreement for any future GST to be counted as part of total revenue for the purpose of calculating the contributions to the replacement and renewal reserve. This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I challenged them on this point, they initially claimed that this was necessary because their experience was that the imposition of a GST invariably resulted in significant increase in the cost of goods to be purchased from the replacement and renewal reserves of their hotels. In the USA they have plenty of experience with `consumption taxes'. I argued that the Liberals' proposed GST was to be offset by removal of sales taxes, with a consequent `revenue neutral' result. Their reaction was the laugh and say, `That's what they all say'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then came the most astonishing news of all. They argued that, in their extensive experience, the revenue of international resort hotels from overseas tour group operators is invariably reduced by the full amount of any GST from the moment it is introduced. Their logic was very convincing. They pointed out that international resort hotels are&mdash;and we know this from our own experience&mdash;in direct competition with other international destinations. Hence, their rates tend to be set not only by comparison with competitor hotels in the same market, but by comparison with hotels in competitor markets in other countries. In Australia we see many examples of this&mdash;for example, Noumea competes with Bali.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, if a 15 per cent GST is introduced, then the operators of international resort hotels in Australia will almost certainly find that they must absorb the full cost of that GST by maintaining their net rates to the wholesalers at previously established levels, and paying the GST themselves out of that revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns of the development manager are well-founded. The fact is that the goods and services tax will stifle investment in tourism infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those opposite these questions: are they aware that the 15 per cent goods and services tax will destroy tourism in this country? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 September 1989, the mother of two children was bashed to death with a house brick by her de facto husband. This was while he was on bail awaiting trial for a previous assault upon her. The younger of their two daughters was also severely assaulted, resulting in an extensive skull fracture, intercranial bleeding, a right hemiplegia and a sixth cranial nerve palsy&mdash;in layman's terms, this 13-month-old child had what we would call a stroke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 August 1991 in the Supreme Court, the de facto husband was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and to 15 years for the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon his daughter. Temporary custody of the two children was awarded to their maternal grandparents, whom I will call Mr and Mrs G, pending a custody challenge by the paternal grandmother, Mrs M. Mr and Mrs M have both been convicted of crimes of violence. Before the Family Court, a seven-page document detailing the criminal record of Mr M was presented. It included three charges of attempted murder, two of policemen and one of his wife, crimes for which he was given a sentence in Goulburn Gaol. Another charge of assault has been laid against him by his wife since his release. Other convictions related to driving offences, illegal use of firearms and alcohol abuse. At the same hearing, a three-page document was presented detailing the criminal convictions of Mrs M for theft and other charges relating to dishonesty, and for assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr and Mrs M applied to legal aid to get custody of their son's children. They were rejected. Then, because Mr M, the children's step-grandfather, was an Aborigine, they went to Aboriginal legal aid. No-one else involved in this case had any Aboriginal blood whatsoever. Because of the potential damage of the proceedings to these two children, who had already suffered major trauma, the judge ordered that a single evaluation by an eminent child psychiatrist should occur. This was done by Professor Brent Waters of the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Sydney. His report said in part that Mr and Mrs M have such a high tolerance for aggression that the children, if they were to spend time with them, may well be exposed to further unnecessary hostility and violence, which the Ms would not necessarily see as damaging to the children, and thus from which they may not be sufficiently protected. Moreover, he said, the style of family life in the M household is probably sharply different to the security and routine of the G family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about one of the children, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This child seemed to be a fairly secure child and to be of average concentration and persistence. If her behaviour was less well controlled in the M household, as the Ms claimed, then it is probably due to a lax, inconsistent and sometimes frightening style of parenting. Under the circumstances, I am of the opinion that access would not be in the children's best interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Legal Service declined to accept this report and they demanded another evaluation, which was denied by the presiding judge and by the children's independent barrister on the grounds that the G family had been subjected to sufficient stress already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undeterred, the Aboriginal Legal Service counsel then proposed a three-day-plus hearing during which they proposed to produce expert witnesses to assert that Aboriginal children should never be taken from an Aboriginal home&mdash;a somewhat curious assertion as the children are not Aboriginal, have no memory of Mr and Mrs M and have been raised in their mother's Jewish faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So concerned was the children's psychiatrist that she wrote to the solicitors in August 1991 in the following terms. I should say that, three years after the assault, these children are still having to see a psychiatrist weekly. She writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, I am the consultant child and family psychiatrist who is now working with the [G] family, especially seeing the older child for weekly therapy following her grossly distressing experiences, including witnessing the serious assault on her sister and the murder of her mother.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very concerned about the horrendous, emotionally stressful, financially draining and quite irrational Family Law Court battle which continues after 14 hearings about custody/access of these two children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .           . . .           . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ongoing protracted litigation is causing enormous financial burden on Mr and Mrs [G], secondarily destabilising the children's security and emotional well-being.</PARA>
<PARA>I will summarise the case. A man murders his de facto wife and attempts to murder his 13-month-old daughter. He is convicted on both counts. The deceased wife's parents, who are stable and provide a loving environment, are given temporary custody. The husband's parents, who have a 10-page criminal record between the two of them, apply to legal aid and are refused. And yet we have three years of legal proceedings, 18 court appearances and tens of thousands of dollars spent, because Aboriginal Legal Aid takes up the case, when the only person who is Aboriginal is the step-grandfather of one of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make myself quite clear here: I have no grievance against the Family Court, which behaved in an exemplary manner in this case. I have no grievance against Mr and Mrs M, or their son, who has been judged by the full weight of the law. Nor do I have any grievance against Aboriginal legal aid generally, because around Australia many Aboriginal legal services provide an outstanding service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance is solely against the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service, which has behaved in a vexatious manner by pursuing a totally irrational case with no merit and no chance of success whatsoever. In doing so, it has caused enormous strain, trauma and financial damage to a couple who are merely trying to adopt their murdered daughter's children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, Aboriginal legal aid receives taxpayers' money through ATSIC for the very important task of providing representation for Aboriginal people in attempting to keep Aboriginal people out of gaol. But, like it or not, in receiving that money it is accountable, through ATSIC, to the Australian Parliament and to its people. It does not receive money to run a private case where nobody indirectly involved is Aboriginal. It does not receive money to behave in a vexatious manner. It does not receive money to pursue some vague political objective in a manner that places enormous financial and emotional burdens on innocent people. And it does not receive money to behave in a manner that pays no heed whatsoever to the well-being of two totally innocent children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service believes that it is a law unto itself and that it is accountable to no-one. Equally obviously, it has no procedures to determine the merit of the case or which cases should, in fact, be pursued. If the case that I have outlined today is typical of the New South Wales Aboriginal Legal Service's work, its total lack of accountability will mean that others will place accountability on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met the family of Mr and Mrs G. They bear no malice. They are merely concerned that the trauma they have been put through should not be passed on to others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout the grim days of drought and rural and manufacturing recession there have been two beacons of hope in the Hunter Valley. One beacon has been viticulture and tourism, but the brightest shining beacon which has helped shield my electorate from the ravages of unemployment has been the coalmining industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalmining industry has been a tower of strength and has played a magnificent role in keeping alive the Hunter Valley economy. The last couple of years have not witnessed a boom in coalmining but the industry has kept its head above water and provided jobs&mdash;jobs which are the lifeblood for a region which is the engine-room of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, tragically, the Hunter coalmining industry is in trouble. Yesterday at Cessnock, 2,000 northern miners attended an aggregate meeting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no suggestion, Mr Deputy Speaker, that those 2,000 men who met yesterday are troublemakers flexing their industrial muscles for irrational gains. The Northern President of the United Mineworkers Federation of Australia, Mr Mick Watson, and his men are behaving most responsibly in trying to ensure that employment opportunities are not decimated because of illogical decisions and policies being pursued by governments and mine owners. </PARA>

Miners have made sacrifices and acted responsibly in agreeing to restructuring and enterprise agreements, but the concessions granted by miners have not been reciprocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, along with my Labor colleagues in the Hunter, will be meeting with the northern miners as soon as possible. We are as determined as they are to prevent mine closures and losses of jobs. We want jobs for those 206 Lemington miners and the other unemployed miners in the Hunter. It is imperative that governments, coal owners and the unions get together to come up with a strategy to ensure the viability and stability of the coalmining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a grievance debate. The name is appropriate because I have several grievances but I will probably only have time to mention one more. I am grieving because of a quandary that has racked our nation for more than 100 years and is now causing unimaginable pain: the arguments about free trade versus protectionism. We all know the dangers of protection. We all know that it destroys the incentive to become competitive. We know about the problems of subsidies, tariffs, quotas, et cetera. Every time a delegation from America or the EC comes here and we tell them about the lunacy of their policies and subsidies, they say, `What about you and your TCF industries'. I know all about that. I understand that if we do not buy from the Asian countries, they can rightly say to us, `If you won't buy our products, we won't buy yours'. So we need free trade. Why should a nation of 17 million people be foolish? Why should we lead the crusade to establish a level playing field? Why should we tilt at windmills&mdash;take on the world&mdash;and get our heads kicked in?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fighting just battles is all right but a charge of the light brigade is madness. We must have some regard for the level of casualties. Lenin was spot on when he coined the phrase `One step forward and two steps back'. If someone is 25 stone and wants to lose weight, he does not try to run a marathon and kill himself. If we want to make our manufacturing industries more competitive, we do not drive them at a pace which kills them stone dead. Our plan, which stages the reduction in protection for the TCF industries, is too rapid and too harsh. I admit it is no easy task to judge the pace of reform, but quite clearly we have failed. We have failed the Neville Wran test: jobs, jobs, jobs. We have failed the jobs test in a period of deep recession. We talk about value added but allow our manufacturing base to grow smaller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One textile and clothing firm in the Hunter, National Textiles Ltd, has seen its work force shrink from 1,200 to 450; that is, 750 jobs have gone in 12 to 18 months. Bonds Wear Factory has shed jobs and the staff there are working a four-day week. Depict fashions has cut its work force by 200. In a few years we will have no textile and clothing industry in the Hunter and that is a tragedy. People will suffer; communities will suffer, and that is crazy. It would not be so crazy if replacement jobs were available but there are no replacement jobs. Textile and clothing factories in the Hunter have high technology, are well managed, are efficient and their production is excellent. They cannot compete with subsidised rivals who have a lower tax base and pay chicken manure wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and India are killing us. I do not mind the Pakistanis beating us at cricket but when we talk about a level playing field we should really define the advantages which flow both ways. When our TCF industries are dead, there will be little benefit to Australian consumers because the Coles Myer domination of the retail field will spoil that scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, what message are we sending our investors? The message writ in large print is, `If you're going to invest in manufacturing, go offshore&mdash;invest outside Australia'. As evidenced in Question Time yesterday, if this Government's TCF policy is slightly crazy, the Opposition's is full-blown. By the year 2000 we intend to reduce protection to the TCF industries by 25 per cent. Opposition members would have zero tariffs; no protection&mdash;zilch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe Minister Button is right and maybe the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is right. I believe, and I am sure there are many on the other side of the House&mdash;there are certainly many on this side of the House&mdash;who believe that the gung ho approach to a free trade environment is a complete and utter disaster. I do not know how we solve the problem. Maybe tougher anti-dumping laws could be applied. Asians can land a garment here for $8 including fabric and make-up. The same garment in Australia costs $12 before any charges are added. Tougher anti-dumping rules should be used to protect our domestic manufacturers and primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other grievances I wish to mention. I am concerned about the situation at Alcan. Aluminium production is certainly a cyclical business. Some 600 people are employed by Alcan. I will be doing my darnedest to ensure that their jobs are protected. As well, on some future occasion, I will want to say something about our attitude towards requests from Thailand, the USA, New Zealand and Denmark to import chicken meat into Australia. It would be absolutely calamitous for the chicken meat industry, the poultry industry, having regard to some of the disease problems like salmonella and Newcastle disease and the level of wages paid in Thailand. Some 1,600 jobs could be lost at the Australian poultry works at Beresfield. I will not allow that to happen. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

After two or three years, not only do they lack skills but they have to account for being out of the workforce for two years.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting, for instance, to compare the situation we have now, in this recession that we had to have, with the incidence of crime or of poverty and homelessness that occurred during the Great Depression. As reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, Detective-Inspector Bob Kucera, who is a Churchill scholar, told the National Wellness Conference in Perth that the level of crime indicated the sickness of society. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . crime was more prevalent today because of poverty, unemployment, growing isolation created by suburbia, an apparent lack of community spirit and family breakdowns. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although unemployment and poverty were far worse during the Depression of the 1930s, people stuck together and if parents left the home or had troubles, the next-door neighbours often took the children in hand.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also clear that the high interest rates and the high youth unemployment were a deliberate policy used by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the former Treasurer, to engineer this recession we had to have. Ironically, when one views those comments made by Detective-Inspector Kucera, one thinks of the situation today and the social engineers of the Left who have tirelessly worked to break down the importance of the family unit. This has also been a high contributory factor in the high rate of juvenile crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also ironic, for all of the Prime Minister's talk of Australia asserting its sovereignty, that his Government has handed over huge slabs of Australia's independence via international covenants and treaties which, via the external treaties provisions of the Constitution, override the sovereignty of the Australian people and of course the Australian States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the rampant crime rate that is affecting the country, it really is not fair to blame the police.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to dispel one myth that is contained in the first clause of the motion before us today&mdash;that is, the apparent failure of police to do their job properly, which is implied in that particular clause. In 1980 to 1981, when there were 845,923 offences reported to police throughout the country, there was a clean-up rate of 34.91 per cent. In 1988-89 there were 1,410,065 offences reported&mdash;an increase of 66 per cent on the previous figure&mdash;yet the clean-up rate was still around 30.07 per cent; in other words, a drop of only about 5 per cent in the clean-up rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 10 years between 1978 and 1988, police strength rose from 29,441 to 37,875, a rise of only 28.6 per cent. Thus, if we compare the clean-up rate to the rise in the offences reported to police throughout the country and we add the police strength as a factor, we find that there is little statistical evidence. . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, evidence to back up that particular theory.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, if one looks at the huge losses incurred by the Western Australian Labor Government under its WA Inc. business dealings, one sees that there is a great lack of resources available to the police in Western Australia, particularly in Perth. I know from my own experience in the northern suburbs of Perth that, if many of my constituents and the residents of that area were aware of exactly how many members of the police force are actually on duty in the area at night time, they would be greatly concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also received in recent times a complaint from one of my constituents who happens to have a daughter-in-law who is in the WA police.

They taunt them on the expectation that, should they ever get charged, little will happen to them as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recite my own experience when I was a detective in the general crime squad in the Western Australian police force. We went to locate one particular offender who had committed a series of offences. We went to the foster home where he was in care to talk about those offences.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of the problems that are being experienced by members of the Western Australian police force, there has been an increasing number of teenagers who have been using stolen cars to try to run down motorcycle policemen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to report to the House on the implementation of Government initiated policies and programs in support of people with disabilities, their carers and providers of services. My most recent previous report on this issue was on 2 March 1992, when I delineated aspects of the disability reform package brought down by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), which package is designed to provide upgraded job opportunities, job incentives, security of income and support services for people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report elicited an extraordinary attack by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) on Government performance in the area of disability services. Such an attack is disturbing in that, while it certainly portrays problems and anxieties confronting people with disabilities and their carers, by erroneously and politically attributing these problems to one source&mdash;that source being the Government which has taken on the responsibility of reforming disability policy&mdash;it forms a major impediment to the enlightened approach to people with disabilities which is thankfully replacing the shroud of darkness which enveloped this issue in decades past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this Government has done more for people with disabilities than has any government before it. Against many other competing priorities, the Government has increased funding for disability services each year. Since 1983, funding provided to non-government agencies to provide accommodation, personal care, training and employment has increased from $104m to $279m and will increase further to $383m by 1996&mdash;an almost fourfold improvement which represents an increase in real terms of over 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts are a matter of record. If they are ignored or falsified, the debate on directions for future policy and programs for people with disabilities, being built on one false premise with political overtones, is devalued. If it is devalued, the general public may slip back into the attitude of disinterest which marked the formulation of disability policy for the major part of this century. People with disabilities and their carers deserve better than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not ask the honourable member for Hawker and other members of this House to refrain from the criticisms which are part and parcel of our democratic system, but it behoves us all to understand the background to disability policy in this country and to understand the effect of our words on carers of people with disabilities. The person with a disability must be given top priority in the formulation of programs to ensure that that person achieves the best quality lifestyle possible. But in many cases, particularly where the disability is intellectual, it is the carer who carries the heaviest load of the knowledge of the extent of the disability, of which the person with the disability may not be aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the beginning of this century, society responded to such disabilities by shutting people away, leaving them and their carers without positive support. Later, non-government agencies, many of them backed by churches and service organisations and attracting government funding, became providers of facilities for people with disabilities. This lifted a huge load from the shoulders of carers, giving them support and respite. At that stage, facilities were designed to protect and support. Therapy was given and respite was provided. But the lifestyle of people with disabilities was seen as very limited. It was not considered possible that people with disabilities who entered homes, therapy centres and sheltered workshops could work in the open work force or live independently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These providers deserve the heartfelt thanks of our society. The carers were, in my opinion, unsung heroes, virtually giving up their own lives to provide support for their offspring. This still happens. But as professional and public enlightenment grows, it has become apparent that hundreds of thousands of people with the ability to live better quality lifestyles have been imprisoned by our society's acceptance of their perceived passive role. Evidence has accumulated pointing to the need for major reform to set people with disabilities free. What was needed was a government with the resolve and commitment to act upon that evidence, collected from those most affected: the people with the disability and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Federal Government did so act, creating the Disability Services Act. This Act is regarded internationally as a great step forward in legislative support for services assisting people with a disability. It would be naive and indeed harmful for anyone to believe that the Act delivers all that is required. No one Act and no one government can deliver all that is required. It is true that there will probably never be enough money to do everything that we want to do. It is also true that we want to be able to do more for people with a disability everywhere in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My current shopping list for Federal and State governments includes: provision of facilities and supervised activities on a continuing weekly business hours basis for people unable to utilise employment schemes, in the eighteenth year and beyond; security in the form of guaranteed financial and human support as an alternative to nursing homes for older people in care, after the carer's demise; adequate opportunities for the integration into `normal' playgroup situations for children aged one to five, or children whose intellectual age is preschool; and extended places in competitive and supportive employment schemes for people with disabilities who in the past went into sheltered workshops. I will continue to lobby for these facilities in policy development forums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely essential, however, that all concerned people pull behind the reforms carried in the Act. For reform means change, and people, particularly those most vulnerable, fear change. If this fear is fed in a negative fashion, it will be a tragedy for those people with disabilities who are now finding that life is worth living, and who would be forced to retreat to the bitter safety of life behind closed doors if the implementation of programs under the Act were discontinued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government is striving to raise the standard of living for Australians with a disability. But it is faced with making up for years and years of minimal effort, of low priority given to the needs of people with a disability. If members of this House tell constituents caring for people with disabilities that the Federal Government is to blame for those adverse aspects of their lives not yet rectified by the reform program, they are doing them a disservice. For change to be successful, it must be supported by all levels of government and community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with disabilities need the facts so that they can direct their lobbying activities to the right quarter. They need to know that there are people in government bureaucracy who are striving to rectify past wrongs. Speaking as a Government member who is intimately acquainted with the problems facing people with disabilities and their carers, I wish to put the record straight. Support for people with a disability is an integral part of this Government's commitment to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability services program provides financial support to organisations to provide services and facilities and facilitate changes in Australian society which lead to recognition and acceptance of the rights of people with a disability. It was also this Government which negotiated the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, an historic agreement that promises to end the duplication and lack of coordination between the efforts of States and the Federal Government. Every State government, including South Australia, signed this agreement last July. The agreement clarifies Federal responsibility for employment programs for people with a disability, while accommodation and personal care services are clearly the responsibility of State and Territory governments. All that it takes to implement the agreement is the enactment of legislation similar to the Disability Services Act, the landmark legislation introduced by this Government and passed in this Parliament in 1987 with bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government stands ready to transfer to State and Territory governments over $1 billion over the five years of the Agreement. It has also agreed to give an additional $245m over the next five years to assist in improving the quality of services in those States that implement the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the five-year period of the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement, this Government will provide almost $2,000m for distribution directly and through State governments to non-government agencies to support their efforts in that area. The Queensland Government is already involved in assessing the views of people with disabilities, carers, providers and interested members of the public as the basis for its ongoing disability policy and programs. Two services in South Australia have benefited recently from government grants.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My particular grievance relates to Australia Post's proposed changes to its registered publication service and the impact of such changes on local country newspapers. Australia Post must fulfil certain community service obligations as stipulated under section 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act. These include an obligation to provide a reasonably accessible service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis wherever they reside or carry on business. Since this Labor Government has been on the treasury bench, mail services to rural areas of Australia have been significantly reduced. Many communities have had post offices replaced with postal agencies; others are threatened with the closure of the postal agency altogether. Rural residents must fight to maintain mail deliveries in the face of their downgrading. On this basis alone, I believe that Australia Post is in serious breach of its community service obligation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, more specifically, I draw the attention of the House to the introduction of minimum quantity regulations and the removal of concessional rates for registered publications. In plain English, registered publications, for example, newspapers and magazines, must now attract a minimum of 50 subscribers within the local post code area and 500 subscribers outside this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these minimum numbers of newspapers are not posted to the respective areas, Australia Post will automatically levy the newspaper proprietor with an appropriate postal charge afforded to the minimum quantity&mdash;thus the minimum quantity regulation. This regulation takes no consideration of the situation facing country newspapers across Australia. Many such newspapers cannot ever hope to achieve the minimum quantity threshold of 50 local subscribers and 500 subscribers outside their local postcode area. Under this proposed regulation rural newspapers are going to be penalised for their size. Furthermore, the removal of concessional rates for registered publications will result in the average postal cost of one country newspaper edition rising from 35c to 40c in the local area and 55c elsewhere, providing the paper meets the minimum quantity regulation. This further impacts on the viability of country newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate how these regulations impact on rural newspapers I will use the example of a typical paper in the electorate of Maranoa, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stanthorpe Border Post</EMPHASIS>. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Post</EMPHASIS> has 25 local subscribers and 147 subscribers outside its local postcode areas. These figures are far removed from the new Australia Post regulations. The effect on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stanthorpe Border Post</EMPHASIS> is alarming. The cost of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Post</EMPHASIS> to subscribers is 40c. Prior to the introduction of Australia Post's new regulations the postal charge for one edition was 35c. Therefore, the total cost of one edition amounted to 75c, resulting in a yearly subscription rate for 100 papers of $75. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new postal regulation the price of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Post</EMPHASIS> will vary between the local area and elsewhere. The postal cost of one edition within the local area will now blow out to 80c by comparison with 35c, resulting in a total cost of $1.20 and a yearly subscription of $120. Outside the local area the postal cost of one edition will skyrocket to $1.87 compared with the previous 35c rate, resulting in a total cost of $2.27 and a yearly subscription rate of $227. For the majority of subscribers to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stanthorpe Border Post</EMPHASIS> the cost of purchasing the local paper will rise from $75 a year to an alarming $227. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain how this 150 per cent increase is arrived at. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Border Post</EMPHASIS> will be charged a 55c rate on 500 papers, the minimum quantity, even though there are only 147 subscribers. Therefore, the 147 subscribers must subsidise an extra 353 pretend or imaginary subscribers that Australia Post deems the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stanthorpe Border Post</EMPHASIS> to have. This results in subscriptions at the inflated rate of $1.87 for one edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stanthorpe Border Post</EMPHASIS>. Larger newspapers will be levied only 55c per edition. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly these regulations discriminate against small rural towns. While local papers may be circulated with no increase in large towns, the smaller, more remote communities must pay, and will be forced to pay, substantially more. Many residents will be unable to afford such exorbitant price increases and, therefore, must forgo purchasing the local paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant social importance of the country newspaper must not be overlooked. It is the more isolated communities that rely on the information supplied by the local newspaper. Those communities that do not have access to the metropolitan daily papers&mdash;and there are certainly many in the electorate of Maranoa&mdash;rely heavily on the local variety to fill the void. It is, however, these communities that face a 150 per cent increase in postal charges to receive their local newspapers. It is, in fact, the communities who can least afford such an increase on both social and financial grounds who are being hit the hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw the attention of the House to an analysis based on the 1986 census figures. The median annual income for men living in rural areas in 1986 was $11,900 compared to their urban counterpart's annual income of $15,500. Unemployment is substantially higher in rural areas and rural students are only half as likely to enter higher education as are urban students. However, this Government persists in penalising already disadvantaged communities, as those figures confirm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an easy solution. I believe an exemption from the minimum quantity regulation imposed under the banner of `print post' should be made available to small country newspapers. These regulations clearly hinder access to vital community information for residents living in rural areas. The charge is levied on local papers least able to afford it, residents least able to afford it and communities least able to afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reverting to Australia Post's community service obligations, I believe I have presented a strong case that the imposition of minimum quantity regulations breaches the requirement of section 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act to provide a reasonable, accessible service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside. This regulation is not equitable, it is not reasonable and it is certainly not responsible. The only equitable, reasonable and responsible course of action would be the elimination of the minimum quantity regulation for the small country newspaper. Given the fact that the new regulations and charges will be imposed on country newspapers from the date of the renewal of registration with Australia Post as a registered publication, I would urge the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) to give this matter urgent consideration and reverse that regulation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> in its editorial of 19 March 1992 commented on three major potential projects for our region:  the Matrix Aeronautics Australia aircraft maintenance facility at Williamtown Airport; the interest of Amecon and the Australian Submarine Corporation in the Minehunter project; and the Coal and Allied Industries Ltd coal liquefaction project. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> made the point that the projects were all linked and that they would all build on existing strengths in the Hunter, with strength in technology being well to the fore. The editorial went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hunter has the natural resources and the skilled people to make almost any type of project a success. But success will be elusive without constant investment in new technology. The challenge, then, is twofold. First, the region must be prepared to put its own money into new equipment. And, second, it must persuade investors elsewhere that investment in technology in the Hunter is money well spent.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with and support those comments. They are appropriate and accurate. But they apply to all of Australia. If we are to generate a broader based economy, if we are to have a greater level of manufacturing exports, we have to get better at what we do. We have to become more efficient, we have to become more productive, we have to have more initiative in seeking out world markets, and we have to use our talents and our skills in building up the efficiency and productivity of our industries so that Australians look to buying Australian products rather than imported products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are objectives we have to win. They are not going to be handed to this nation on a plate. They are not going to be handed to our region on a plate. The point of the editorial, in my view, is spot on. The One Nation package that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced on 26 February this year will do much to encourage and facilitate the investment in new plant and equipment that is needed to lift our level of manufacturing exports and to lift the level of import replacement that comes from an improvement in our manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to the accelerated depreciation allowances. That improvement in allowances will enable Australian businesses&mdash;Australian firms&mdash;to update plant and equipment so that we get to use a much wider range of world class state-of-the-art equipment, so that we can compete with companies that are now newly industrialising and countries where workers know only the latest plant that is available in the world. In our plants and factories we are labouring with the practices and management-type operations that belong to a period decades earlier, often using equipment that was manufactured decades earlier. The acceleration of depreciation allowances will facilitate that investment in new plant and equipment, enabling us to become more competitive in international and domestic markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the point I made last about Newcastle, and that is its attraction as a place to visit. The Hunter region has enormous potential for tourism but, again, there has to be investment in facilities. There has to be an upgrading of the quality of service that is offered. The provisions in the One Nation package for increased depreciation allowance for tourism facilities will again facilitate and encourage the investment that is needed in the region to provide a better quality of service and a wider range of services for people who want to visit our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I support wholeheartedly the points made in the editorial, but I also point out that we need as a people in our region, as Australians, to recognise that tourism is an industry that is labour intensive, that has enormous potential, and that offers the opportunity to create jobs&mdash;well paid jobs, real jobs, lasting jobs&mdash;that will earn us export income but most of all give opportunity to the men and women and youth of this nation. </PARA>

Honourable members will remember that about six weeks ago I got up in this House and said, `I am very sympathetic towards the unemployed, you all know that.

Those protesters are still down at the Picton River, holding up people who want to work&mdash;ordinary men and women who are earning their living by the forest industries, paying hire purchase on their trucks, trying to make a decent living.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise what must be among the most irresponsible proposals in the history of this Parliament. I refer to the transport policy of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to reduce the price of petrol by about 30 per cent for the public and 39 per cent for business and to increase the cost of public transport by 15 per cent as part of the GST package. The absence of a level playing field between public and private transport funding has already resulted in a major distortion of land use and transport systems throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's proposal to dramatically increase this distortion will result in accelerated urban sprawl, massive traffic congestion, parking frustration, air and noise pollution, pedestrian difficulties and devaluation of property in Australia's cities. In the rural areas there will be a horrific increase in truck and bus accidents, with a major shift in transport of goods and people from rail to road. Road deterioration and maintenance will increase, as will the costs of new construction, to cope with the increased volumes and truck sizes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My concern is in respect of the plight of small businessmen in the tourist industry who will be adversely affected by the Opposition's goods and services tax in the unlikely event that it wins the next Federal election. The Opposition claims that payroll tax will be abolished on the introduction of the goods and services tax. However, more than 80 per cent of tourist operators do not pay payroll tax. So the abolition of payroll tax will not affect them at all, but they will be affected in this way: as a small business, tourist operators will be the collection points for the goods and services tax. Tourist operators will be forced to bear the burden of administering the tax and ensuring compliance. Research in the United Kingdom has found that the compliance cost varied from about 2 per cent of turnover for small businesses to only 0.003 per cent of turnover for larger firms. This will place small businesses at a huge competitive disadvantage. In addition, small businesses will also have to set up recording and accounting systems for payment of the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make this point indelibly clear as to the impact of the GST on small business. The GST is payable at the point of sale. This means that for every credit sale the business has to carry the cost of the tax until accounts are paid. This will add to the cost of businesses offering 30, 60 and 90 days credit. The goods and services tax has created fear and confusion amongst many tourism operators, particularly in north Queensland, where there have been meetings expressing opposition to it. </PARA>

The honourable member asks how successful we have been in bringing down the rate of inflation. The answer is that we have been very successful.

The first is that of price stability; the second is the maintenance of full employment; and the third is to contribute to the general prosperity of the community. We on this side of the House believe that the Reserve Bank should have a broad range of objectives. It is not there just to pursue one objective single-mindedly to the exclusion of everything else. Apart from that, over time the objectives of the bank may well change as it shifts its emphasis from one area to another. In this regard our central bank has common objectives with many other central banks around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This question takes on very particular significance. In this country at the moment we are talking about how to maintain low levels of inflation and how the proponents of a consumption tax could deal with the inflationary surge which would come from the imposition of a consumption tax in Australia, which everyone knows would have very dramatic effects on prices here, as it has had in every other country where a consumption tax has been introduced. What the Opposition says in relation to this matter&mdash;and it dismisses the question of inflation or the containment of inflation&mdash;is essentially stated in two lines in its document. First of all, it says that the Opposition would commit overall economic policy, and monetary policy in particular, to the medium term goal of price stability. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential, if chronic inflationary expectations are to be squeezed out of the system, for fiscal and monetary policy to be kept firm while the other policy initiatives are undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Opposition intends to have the whole burden of containing inflation and squeezing out this inflationary surge resting with the Reserve Bank monetary policy; in other words, high interest. In this matter, of course, the Opposition had expected some support from the man in Australia who has perhaps the highest reputation as being the person most concerned about the achievement of lower inflation in this country. That person is the retiring Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, John Phillips.</PARA>

So far this year, over $350,000 has been given to 40 agencies for distribution of emergency relief for unemployed people and families in crisis in northern Melbourne. We have increased our emergency relief grants to the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security currently has three regional offices in the area to assist welfare recipients at Brunswick, Moonee Ponds and Coburg. Through the CES the Government has established three job centres, three special service centres, a youth access centre and an industry centre to assist job searchers. You want to be rid of the CES. You want to turn it into a simple commercial referral agency. That is your proposal. You want to turn the CES into a simple referral agency not dealing with the problems of the long term unemployed and not operating all the services which are currently operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same area there have been substantial increases in help for the unemployed through Jobstart and Jobtrain in the north-western suburbs, and more are planned.

This follows years of inaction by the conservatives until 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This substantial effort by the Labor Government is in stark contrast to the message of misery which the Opposition promises for the unemployed. The Opposition has promised to cast 90,000 unemployed people onto the social scrap heap by withdrawing their benefits.

About a year ago I went on the record saying that I thought the balances in the Reserve Bank Act were correct, that is, that part of the Act which focuses the bank on the twin objectives of full employment and price stability and the part requiring the Government and the central bank to agree, but providing in the final analysis that the Government can direct the bank after tabling instruments in the House. Mr Phillips had this say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At one extreme, I guess, is the statutory independence of the Federal Reserve system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about central banks around the world&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and close behind it the Bundesbank. On the other is the British view that the Government sets monetary policy and the Bank of England gives effect to it.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he sees two extremes: the US Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank on one side, and the Bank of England on the other. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some, of course, who believe, or at least assert, that that applies to Australia also. Neither the law nor the historical record is on their side. A decade or more ago they might have been on firmer ground. However, developments over the intervening period have given the bank greater capacity for independent action than in any previous period postwar.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period when Australia had a monetary target, or something that approximated one, it was the Treasurer's target rather than the bank's target, and it was announced in the Budget speech. The exchange rate was fixed by the Government under the Brettonwoods arrangements and the Reserve Bank cleared the market each day at the rate fixed&mdash;not a lot of autonomy in all of that, I am afraid.</PARA>
<PARA>He is commenting on the arrangements which existed basically before this Government. Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a very different ball game with a very different level of autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA>He means now, and he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintaining an effective relationship with Government, while preserving the Central Bank's capacity to form its views and determine its policies free of party political influence can be a difficult balancing act at times, but the independence of the bank depends as much on the skill with which the act is performed as on the specific wording of the piece of legislation. I have worked with a series of governors with well-developed senses of balance.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that the independence relies as much on the ability of the bank, its governor and its board to basically find that position of relationship with the Government to exercise independence as it sees it. He does not put the Reserve Bank of Australia in with the Bank of England as being essentially the target set by the Government, any more than he does the regime which existed before this Government came to office. As such, I think that is a sensible view. He went on to say in a radio program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that the scope, without talking too much about the actual independence of it all, for autonomy in the Reserve Bank is much higher now because of changes in regulations, because of changes in basic structure, than it has been in any previous period that I have been around central banking.</PARA>
<PARA>He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, in real autonomy it is not just right, and it hasn't been for a long time. I think it is proper that someone should try at least and put a bit more fact into the argument and debate that goes on and have the argument at a better level.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what he is saying is basically that the debate has gone off half-cocked and is led by the Leader of the Opposition saying that the central bank is not independent.</PARA>

Of course he would not have done that. I suppose that is the difference between him and the honourable member for Flinders, who will stoop to any low political trick, any low political posture, to make a miserable, lousy political point, even if it is at the expense of his own country in the eyes of the bankers of the region around us.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Adelaide for his question, which goes to the very important question of the administration of the tax system in Australia and the role of the Commissioner of Taxation particularly in that regard. Over the last nine years this Government has bolstered the ability of the Tax Commissioner to undertake his statutory responsibilities. Honourable members should bear in mind that when we came into office the tax system was in a total shambles. The Opposition, when in government, had allowed a situation to obtain where tax avoidance was rampant. The honourable member for Bennelong can well remember that the successive entreaties of the former Tax Commissioner went unacknowledged and unresponded to as the whole taxation system of this country slowly but surely fell apart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have been doing through a succession of important measures is re-establishing the credibility of the taxation system so that the people of Australia can have confidence in the fact that everyone is paying his fair share and the Tax Office has the ability to collect those taxes in the most efficient way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From these people, these vandals who allowed the tax system to fall to bits, comes a new proposal to establish a board over the top of the Taxation Commissioner; presumably people to control the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner has been repeatedly abused and attacked in this Parliament, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition who continues his campaign against important statutory office holders in this country who have no opportunity to reply here or elsewhere to his various attacks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the Opposition would be placing on this board the enemies of the Tax Commissioner, whether they were accountants, Young Liberals, tax accountants or tax lawyers&mdash;the kinds of people who are the enemies of the Tax Commissioner and who are unlikely to support the efforts that he has put in place over the last 10 years. Mr Boucher has a very distinguished record to defend in terms of his particular efforts over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as if to make some kind of curtain-raiser the Leader of the Opposition has decided to establish a kind of pilot scheme of accountants in Sydney in order to design his proposed consumption tax. I do not think accountants are necessarily the best people to devise the best taxation system in Australia.

You are the people who will take those TCF industries of Wills and rip them to pieces. You are the people who will take those clothing, textile and footwear industries in the electorate of Wills and take them, thoughtlessly and simply as a piece of political opportunism, to zero, because in that Fightback package where you had zero tariffs you thought this was the opportunistic way of looking at the hairy chested ones of protection. There is no sense, no judgment, no consultation, no understanding about these industries. No, you build on years of work by us; just simply adopt it and say, `We will go to zero&mdash;we will go to zero.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen proposals to close the three CES offices in the Wills electorate. That is the policy of support for the unemployed that the Liberal Party is offering the Wills electorate in this by-election. That is the position of the Liberal Party. If the population in Wills votes for the Liberal Party in this by-election and then subsequently in the next Federal election, the three CES offices in Wills will be closed, along with those throughout the rest of the nation. It is also the policy of the Liberal Party that the job placement activities that are provided by the CES offices should subsequently be provided by private providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CES places five times as many people as private agencies in this country. Among those who do not complete secondary school, the CES places 14 times as many people as the private providing agencies. The groups that would be most adversely affected by a decision to move from the CES job placement activities&mdash;I might say that the CES currently fills over 500,000 vacancies a year&mdash;would be small business, which would have to pay the private job brokers, and the disadvantaged groups among the unemployed who are especially reliant on free CES services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private job agencies&mdash;it is quite interesting to look at a few of these prices&mdash;currently charge a fee of about 15 per cent of the employee's annual salary. In 1990-91 the CES placed 550,000 people in jobs. Assuming an average placement starting salary of only $20,000, the cost to employers of this number of job placements through private agencies charging at this rate would be $1.9 billion. What is interesting about that is that the GST applies to them. The GST imposition in these circumstances would be $250m.

The Government decided that there needed to be a wool tax in order to support the orderly dispersal and disposal of the wool stockpile. Of course, at that stage we had to make estimates on the best advice of what was likely to happen to the wool price during the course of the disposal of the wool stockpile.

It was for that reason that in the context of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement we did respond to the request from the wool industry to do a couple of things: first of all, to introduce some flexibility about the timing of the repayments of the Wool Realisation Commission to the Government of the loan repayments which had been advanced to it; and, secondly to provide the Wool Realisation Commission with the opportunity to rebate some of the tax which is not at the moment necessary for funding the stockpile.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I wish to table some guidelines on the role of Parliamentary Secretaries. I shall have the guidelines incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIES&mdash;ROLE AND FUNCTION IN RELATION TO PROCEDURES OF THE HOUSE AND ITS COMMITTEES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter of Parliamentary Secretaries and procedures of the House, discussed in the Chamber on 16 and 17 October 1991 in my absence overseas on official business, was drawn to my attention on my return. It has also been the subject of ongoing discussion with the Leader of the House. I will now outline the course I propose to follow regarding the role and functions of Parliamentary Secretaries in relation to the procedures of the House and its committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary Secretaries will perform Chamber duty, representing the Ministry in the Chamber. Provided a Parliamentary Secretary is present in the Chamber, I will not consider it necessary to draw to the attention of the House the convention of requiring a Minister to be present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated by the Leader of the House in moving the motion on 16 October, I believe that it is appropriate that Parliamentary Secretaries be permitted to address the House from the despatch box rather than from their allocated seat in the Chamber. This practice would also be appropriate for Opposition Parliamentary Secretaries in relation to the despatch box on the Opposition side of the Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to legislation, following the adoption by the House of the revised resolution on Parliamentary Secretaries and procedures of the House on 16 October, Parliamentary Secretaries will be able to introduce bills and move motions (including motions for the second reading). In committee of the whole the provisions of standing order 91 (time limits for debates and speeches) will be applied so as to provide for a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of a bill to be permitted to speak for unspecified periods. The contingent notices which appear on the Notice Paper relating to Ministers and legislation may be moved by Parliamentary Secretaries, should this become necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the resolutions of the House, Parliamentary Secretaries will also be able to move motions without notice normally moved by Ministers (for example, in relation to the alteration of the order of business or a motion for the adjournment of the House). In moving motions in the House, Parliamentary Secretaries will not require a seconder, just as motions moved by Ministers do not, by convention, require the support of a seconder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resolution of the House of 16 October repeated the earlier provision of precluding Parliamentary Secretaries from answering questions. It is the practice of the House that Ministers do not ask questions, either of other Ministers, or where permitted, of private Members. This will also apply to Parliamentary Secretaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the resolution of the House of 16 October and the sessional orders relating to private Members' business and Members' statements, together with the spirit pertaining to those procedures, has the combined effect of preventing Parliamentary Secretaries from participating in proceedings of that kind. There is no prohibition on Ministers participating in the grievance debate and historically Ministers have on infrequent occasions taken part in the debate. I therefore feel that it would be appropriate for Parliamentary Secretaries to be allowed to continue to participate in that debate if they so wish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, as a general rule, I do not believe that Parliamentary Secretaries should be members of committees of inquiry. There may, however, be occasions when special reasons such as the particular character of a Member's electoral division make a strong case for the Member serving as a member of a parliamentary committee while being a Parliamentary Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other matters may arise concerning Parliamentary Secretaries and the procedures of the House which have not been covered in this statement. Should that occur, I will address such matters as they arise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;quite in order. I must have been wrong, as I said, amongst all that clanking of coffee cups, because the Prime Minister has changed his position 180 degrees on a consumption tax; we know that. He must have said, `I will lie in a ditch for any vote'. Yesterday he went down to Wills and he did just that&mdash;for any vote. He went down below the gutter, into the ditch, and blatantly ran for votes on the issue of protection. He knew full well that back then in London in 1989 he had said that abolishing tariffs by the year 2000 was an objective: he said that time and time again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now in a situation where we have a Prime Minister who has changed his position on consumption tax, changed his position on tariffs, changed his position on Coronation Hill, and changed his position on all sorts of things. He knows that the responsible position, both from Opposition and Government, is that protection has to come down. In fact, he has boasted at length&mdash;and did it again today&mdash;that his is the only government that had the courage to bring protection down. I might say that he also said that there was nobody on this side of the House who had ever advocated such a thing in the early days and that he, and presumably the ACTU, were the only people who took that particular position.

We know that this Government has an industry policy which has put an enormous number of people out of work. It has put them out of work because it has embraced only one half of the policy. It has tariffs coming down, but it will not get costs down. We, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;at least like your side of the House in recent days&mdash;have gone round to business after business after business. They say to us, `The first thing you have got to do is to get these taxes that you impose'&mdash;you being the Government&mdash;`on us down'. That is what they say. The tax that big business wants down is payroll tax. It is No. 1. They say it to us every time, in every meeting, in every boardroom. So why does the Government not get it down. Do those opposite know why they cannot get it down? It is because this man who sat down here earlier today has done a 180-degree turn on the consumption tax. That is why they cannot get it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the same man came back from his sojourn in London&mdash;no doubt talking to the Queen&mdash;he said, `Protection under whatever guise is protection. Protection, whatever it is called, ends up being protection'. He went on to say, `We have had 40 years of going backwards under this policy'. When he said, `Protection under whatever guise is protection', was he talking about the Government's contraception policy? What was he talking about if he was not talking about tariff reduction, getting rid of quotas and getting rid of all those impediments to making Australia healthy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has boasted about being tougher than Button. He has boasted about getting up there and making sure that he can do the things which the Minister cannot do because the Minister is not strong enough in this area. Today, when the Prime Minister was asked a question on this subject, even by one of his own side, he had to get out the 12 March statement and quote the figures out of the back of the book&mdash;because, of course, he did not want to remember the things he had said about protection in previous days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to top it all off, he said that what he had said on one occasion about protection was only given out on a radio show. Admittedly, the particular radio show has some foibles and some problems; nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country was putting out policy which he says was only given out on a radio show. He has boasted about bringing protection down faster than anybody else. It just shows how tough this man is at his first election test. It is only a small election test&mdash;he is not going to lose government over Wills. But at his first test, at the first whiff of grapeshot&mdash;as he is wont to say; but not even at that, at the first puff of smoke&mdash;he throws out a bit of a loosener on the Government's protection policy. At his first by-election he has folded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I actually do not believe the Prime Minister. I do not believe that the Prime Minister has changed his position at all. I believe that he has dabbled with the truth. I believe, as the Government said in the March statement, that it is going to do what we said we would do. It is going to drop general tariffs right across the board to 5 per cent by the year 1996. That is what it is going to do. The Government is going to bring down the tariffs on refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, clothes dryers, spray guns, weighing machines and every other thing that you can think of in that sort of area to 5 per cent, and in fact after the developing country preferences to zero per cent by the year 1996. That is what the Government is going to do and there is no point in trying to portray a position that is any different. In fact, what we are going to have in 1996 is an average nominal tariff position of 3 per cent over the whole of this country. That is its industry policy and it still will not have delivered it, not that members on the Government side will be there, but even if they were, they will not have delivered the other side of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Government has is an industry policy which has delivered a monumental failure to Australian business and the people it employs. It has killed some of these industries. It has  killed them while reducing assistance across the board. It has cut their tariff support but it has not cut their costs. As I said before, already we have had an automotive manufacturer in the House this morning saying the Government did not deliver on economic reform. In fact, that manufacturer is saying that its mentor and holding company in another part of the world does not believe that the Government is going to deliver either, and neither do we. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every business has asked the Government to do it. Meeting after meeting they tell us, and they must have been telling the Government as well. They do not tell us one thing and the Government something else, but the Government is not listening. In fact, the Government has, as I said, enough Australian businesses believing it is not going to get these costs down that they are starting to take up their shoes and walk offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So why does the Government not get rid of some of these costs? Why does the Government not get rid of payroll tax? It is because it cannot. It is locked in. It cannot get rid of it because of its policy on consumption tax.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Why does the Government not get rid of fuel excise? Why does the Government not get rid of the super levy? Why does it not get rid of excise on fuel? It knows as well as I know that all of these costs and others add up to a disadvantage on every Australian farm of $8,000 a year. If it were to fix them, that is what they would pick up. Multiply that by the sort of figure one would have to to get to the equivalent arrangements for Pacific Dunlop, BHP or Amcor or the rest and one gets to some quite monumental figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, of course, the Government is not going to get rid of the arrangements that lock it in to having the ACTU control business in Australia. It controls big business in this country. It is the one impediment that would give it the greatest productivity changes and the greatest attitudinal changes if it were to make that change and allow people to make their own arrangements with their own employees. I do not believe the Government has the courage to do that job. Not only that, I know it will not do it because it is totally tied to that institution and in fact reactionary in the proper definition of the word `reactionary' which is conservative and resistant to change. Those changes have got to be made. They have to be made in a hurry and in the interests of Australian business because, as Brian Loton said the other day, unless business is profitable it does not employ anybody. What we have got to have in this country is profits, productivity, attitudinal change and freeing up the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the case for as long as the Labor Party has been in power. There is absolutely no doubt that Australian business believes those changes will not be made while the Labor Party is in government. Australian business believes, as it has said to us innumerable times, that it can take the tariff reductions over time as long as they are predictable and as long as it can foresee and understand what is going to happen to it. But Australian business cannot take or absorb the changes to assistance which take place without the other costs coming down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the latest work will show&mdash;as we have said for so long now that one can hardly repeat it without boring oneself to death&mdash;that the greatest benefit will come to manufacturing exporters through the reduction of tariffs. But none of those things will happen unless we get our costs down and unless we get rid of the central control by the ACTU and other institutions of business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not made much of a play since I have been here about this central control by the ACTU; it is better that other people outside have been saying this. But I think it is time that we differentiated our policy from the Government's. The Government has not the slightest intention of allowing ordinary people to make their own decisions in the workplace, and we have. We want those people to get that independence. We want those people to make those decisions for themselves. We want them to write individual contracts for which they can be responsible. When they have had a win or when they have had a loss we want them to have the confidence which those decisions give them so that they can go on and make more decisions. We do not want an Australia where all of those decisions are made by a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exactly the same thing applies to the incidence of business tax. We do not want to take $20 billion in business tax and give back $3 billion to business and say, `This is government policy. Here's a polyglot of measures; a few export subsidies. Here is your industry policy'. We want to leave that $20 billion in the hands of private industry, not of government, so that it can make the decisions and it can get first cut at the money and create the sorts of jobs that Australia needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I come back to my initial point. The Prime Minister went down to Wills yesterday and he flicked a change in the direction of tariff policy. He did this for one reason only: he did it in a big run for votes in Wills. I do not believe that he has changed; I believe he is just fabricating, delving and dabbling in the truth to try to pick up a few cheap votes. Nothing has changed from the consumption tax debate in 1985 and nothing will. The Prime Minister will do anything for a vote. </PARA>

<PARA>The article goes on. The target audience for this debate and the speech of the honourable member for Barker was therefore not the public, members of the Government or industry; it was a speech directed towards his own coalition colleagues in a bid to shore up his deteriorating position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the subject matter of the matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Barker. It castigates the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his alleged failure on taxation reform and micro-economic reform. I point out at the outset that this Government has been responsible for the most thorough going reform of taxation in the nation's history. I will remind honourable members of those reforms: the taxation of capital gains, the taxation of fringe benefits, the lower company tax rate and the removal of the entertainment rorts. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every one of those measures, as the honourable member for Brisbane points out, was opposed by successive oppositions and their successive leaders. When the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Treasurer and the present Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), was his economic adviser, they presided over a taxation system which was a shambles, a taxation system in which tax paying by the wealthy had become an almost voluntary activity. The ordinary PAYE taxpayer had to shoulder the entire burden. As I have mentioned, the coalition opposed almost every reform measure introduced. It opposed the taxation of capital gains, of company cars and of other fringe benefits. It wanted to retain the taxpayer subsidised boozy business lunch. At the same time constituents in electorates such as mine were carting off their lunch to work in a brown paper bag, executives enjoyed the benefit of a taxpayer subsidised long, boozy lunch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Opposition is proposing to burden Australian business with a new tax. That new tax, the GST, will be particularly burdensome for small business because, as was pointed out during a similar debate yesterday, 95 per cent of small business does not pay payroll tax anyway; so it will get nothing from that part of the Fightback package. Philip Anderson, the Director of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen and Co., wrote the following in the January-February issue of the magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate Management</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even for businesses with dedicated accounting staff, the accounting requirements of a GST will take some time to get used to. For smaller firms, the need to comply with the requirements of GST will come as quite a shock.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite an understatement when one considers the evidence from overseas to which I will refer shortly. The coalition's GST will certainly create jobs for tax inspectors, for accountants, for computer salesmen and for lawyers, but it will destroy real jobs in the real economy. The Liberals never cared a jot about micro-economic reform when they were in government, when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister. They did not care about it in the 1950s or 1960s. Now they have the gall, through matters of public importance such as this, to complain that we are not doing enough, but they certainly have no proposals of their own, as was spelled out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday. Those opposite talk about waterfront reform as if it was not already happening, but they offer no tangible proposals other than provoking confrontation with ordinary working people and their unions and ridiculous proposals, like sending in troops to work the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Des Moore, an economic commentator of great reputation, when speaking of Fightback in a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IPA Review</EMPHASIS> and dealing with the comments of the honourable member for Barker, mentioned that the Fightback package would take $20 billion worth of taxation off the back of business. What was not mentioned by the honourable member for Barker&mdash;but which was addressed very well by Mr Moore in his article&mdash;was that the coalition has given some credence to that misconception by business by pursuing the notion that a $20 billion cut in taxes on business would be provided through the introduction of a GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could equally well be argued, of course, that the introduction of a GST would place a $27 billion increase on taxes on business. It is business, after all, that has to pay the GST in the first instance and then has to recoup it by passing it on by way of increased prices, just as it is business that will not pay the other three taxes that the coalition proposes to abolish in the first instance, and then pass those savings on to consumers through lower prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some confusion amongst the ranks of the Opposition about just exactly what Fightback would lift off the back of business. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is in the chamber, had two views on this. Quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 March he said that Fightback would lift $20 billion in tax from the nation's industries. It is a remarkable package. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> two days later, on 15 March, again quotes him as saying that the Fightback package would draw about $50 billion in taxation from the Australian business sector. So it is a remarkable package indeed that can achieve a $30 billion improvement in just two days. Either way, disregarding whether the honourable member for Gippsland was correctly quoted, the fact remains that Fightback will impose a $27 billion burden on the business sector. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will disadvantage the small business sector because it will not receive the advantage of the removal of payroll tax. Essentially the Fightback package is a reshuffle of the tax pack. It is essentially, as the Prime Minister pointed out, a tenth order issue. I was interested in the remark of the honourable member for Barker. He said that unless business makes profits it will not employ anybody. I agree. There is an earlier step, though: unless business has customers it will not make profits and will not employ anybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the Treasury study of the distributive effects of the Fightback package, and the effects that it has on people at different income levels, and when we look at the presentation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program a little while ago about the effect of the Fightback package on different families, we find that 78 per cent of taxpayers are in fact worse off under the Fightback package. Of course, the income brackets which are worst affected begin at slightly under a $40,000 income. Everybody above a $40,000 income is better off, but those below, the majority of Australians&mdash;those ordinary Australians whose interests the honourable member for Barker would have us believe he would like to protect&mdash;will be worse off under the Fightback package: 78 per cent of Australians. How then will business benefit if 78 per cent of Australians have a lower disposable income as the result of this package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some excellent overseas evidence on the effect of similar measures, a goods and services tax, on the business sector. The New Zealand experience, for example, has been well dealt with by a New Zealand accountant, Mr John Morine. He has six major criticisms of the impact of a goods and services tax on the business sector. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years ago a Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in New Zealand. It has resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a confusing and little-understood tax content in virtually every transaction handled by every business, but with variations in the rules for different transactions. Every cash receipt, every payment and each sale and purchase transaction is subject to GST.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a tax-take to the Government of $5 billion per annum, of which $1.25 billion or 25 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a quarter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is lost in meeting the cost to the business sector of complying with the GST legislation and accounting for tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an estimated 20 per cent dissipation of time and resources for small business proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an unknown number of small business failures due to the costs of compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a decline in taxable company income for business&mdash;and therefore to the tax authorities and Government&mdash;because of the forced redirection of resources away from revenue generation and into compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.confusion within the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department . . . where staff are beset with the complexities of trying to audit GST transactions after the event.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Morine's conclusion is that a number of strong arguments have been disclosed against the introduction of a GST. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these, the most persuasive is that complying with the GST legislation will require business to divest itself of about 20 per cent of its resources. This serious redirection of resources will lower the business income subject to company income tax by the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>He ends with an appeal to small business in Australia. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you and the other 800,000 or so small business proprietors throughout Australia do not succeed in getting the GST removed from the political agenda, you will rue the day you took no action. Act now. Otherwise you may not survive.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also ample evidence from Canada that shows, again, that the introduction of a GST has had a devastating effect on the small business sector. A survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business titled `The GST: A National Tax Tragedy' has revealed that 70.6 per cent of respondents found that the GST had a negative impact on their business. There is no doubt that the introduction of the Opposition's Fightback package will have a devastating effect on business. I refer to the area of micro-economic reform, which I know will also be referred to in some detail by the honourable member for Brisbane. I have already mentioned the Government's record of achievement on waterfront reform and taxation reform. I draw the attention of the Parliament also to the proposals on micro-economic reform contained in the One Nation statement. Honourable members opposite should read the elements of the new aviation policy which will allow for competition on international services and new domestic competition from Qantas and later from Air New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point to the record of the Opposition when it was in  government. These Opposition parties when in government held the country in the straitjacket of the two-airlines agreement for far too long. I point to the initiative on electricity generation, distribution and transmission contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> document. I point also to the Opposition record in this area. The Opposition record in this area has been absolutely nothing at all.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point also to our reforms in the industrial relations area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have policies that will save the jobs in this factory, and in others. I will mention just a few of our policies. In relation to the exchange rate, we will float the dollar more freely; we will not be holding the dollar high deliberately. What happens when the dollar is held high?  We get cheaper imports, including tyres from South Korea&mdash;which no doubt displeases the Managing Director of South Pacific Tyres. Exports are dearer. This tyre company is an export factory.

What would that do to the South Pacific Tyres factory?  Many things. Even if we look at the Treasury document in attachment No. 5, we will read that manufacturing will benefit&mdash;by the Treasury's own document&mdash;by $5,370m. These are the sorts of policies that should be put in place.  Surely we do not have to revisit the tariff debate and try to reconvert this economic troglodyte, reborn for a by-election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the issues that the honourable member for Parkes raised on the questions of micro-economic reform and taxation reform and what our relative positions have been on employment. So far as taxation law in this country is concerned, as was pointed out earlier by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), the greatest positive reform of taxation since Federation has occurred in the past nine years of this Government. Company tax levels have been reduced from 46 per cent, when we came to office, to 39 per cent. The top marginal personal income tax rate has fallen from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. The bottom rate when we came to office&mdash;that is, the lowest rate under the then coalition government&mdash;that the lowest paid workers in this country were required to pay was 30 per cent;  it is now 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those rates are to be further adjusted downwards as part of the One Nation statement released by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier this year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were in the process of making these reforms, we were not just about shifting money here and there;  we were about introducing some equity into the taxation system.

We took action to end some of those rorts. At each step, those opposite opposed us. </PARA>

There were the free lunches. The list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On every single one of those measures where this Government took steps to ensure that there was some equity in the tax system and that the burden was not being unfairly shouldered by PAYE taxpayers, the ordinary wage and salary earners, at every step of the way throughout the past nine years the record shows unequivocally that those opposite opposed us&mdash;and they stand condemned for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach of those opposite to tax reform is to shift from an income tax to a consumption tax and, in some way, thereby dramatically improve the quality of life of Australians and increase production&mdash;by increasing the cost of daily items:  milk and meat, bread and butter, and clothing. That is their approach to reform&mdash;not the serious issues that this Government has confronted over the past decade. Of course, as a result of the reforms which we have set in place, the Australian taxation regime is now the second lowest of the OECD countries. That is a record that this Government has introduced&mdash;a record of lower taxes and more equitable taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a moment let us turn to the job market. There is no doubt that the current level of unemployment is too high and is of concern to the Government, as it should be to all decent Australians. In 1990-91 the number of unemployed people for every vacancy was 20.9. That is too high. It is a more useful statistic, I might add, than just talking about unemployed people, because it represents the number of people chasing every single job that is advertised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year when those opposite were in government, the number was not 20.9; it was 34.4. There were an extra 14 or 15 people in the queue for every single job in the community when those opposite were in government. In the 12 months after we took office in 1983-84, we reduced that abysmal performance of the coalition government from 34 people who were looking for every single job to 21. As the years unfolded and until now, we reduced that number to a low in 1988-89 of 7.7 people seeking each advertised job. That was accomplished by creating jobs in Australia at a rate which those opposite never had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first four years of government, the Labor Party created in excess of 700,000 extra jobs. In the last four years in which the Liberals were in government in this country, 300,000 jobs were created. Even taking account of the downturn that has occurred in the past 12 months, this Government has created in excess of 1.3 million jobs since 1983. That is an increase in jobs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is nonsense and the honourable member knows it. If he had looked through the figures on industrial relations over the 1980s when the economy was very buoyant, he would know that days lost through strike in this country were one-third of the record when the lot opposite had the opportunity to run this country. They induced a situation where strikes increased threefold at least, and that is going back to the days when they supported centralised wage fixing. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), who raised this matter of public importance, is not new to the debate. As he pointed out, he was involved in discussions in the early days on the tax summit. As I have had cause to mention on other occasions in this House during other debates, it has not always been a happy venture for him. The June edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> last year carried an article headlined `Libs pull the wheels off the car plan'. This followed some meetings the honourable member had with the car industry. The article reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's car makers are running scared of a coalition victory in the next federal election. Causing the concern is an unreported speech to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) by the shadow minister for industry and commerce, Ian McLachlan . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's policy went down so well with the motor vehicle industry last year that it ended up with that sort of coverage in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. That is what the industry thought of the Opposition's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the other areas in which people have spoken about the need for reform. The often quoted ones are the wharves and the shipping industry. Those opposite know this but tend to ignore it when it suits them. In 1992 Australian ships are being crewed at a level of the order of 12 crew members fewer than was the case 10 years ago. This number is now less than the OECD average. Not only has it been the case with the shipping industry, but similar sorts of gains&mdash;in fact, even more dramatic ones&mdash;have occurred on the wharves in the stevedoring industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bulk handling cargo grain ports are now 50 to 80 per cent more efficient; a fact that has been acknowledged on the public record by the major shipping companies, including Conaust. The Australian Wheat Board is on the record in its last annual report acknowledging that it saved $10m last year alone because of efficiencies in port handling of its grain. Of course, there are other records as well. I refer to a commentary in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on the handling of containers in the various ports. This demonstrates that the Port of Melbourne is amongst the world's best in the time it takes to turn the container cargo around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That type of record has occurred without the sort of industrial disputation that the Opposition wants to invoke. It has occurred because sensible people have sat down for the good of the country and the good of their own employees and members to try to increase the size of the cake, and to do it cooperatively&mdash;to do it through a method of consultation which Opposition members seem unable to comprehend, much less embrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in respect of two matters, both of which were referred to during Question Time today by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In the first instance I was misrepresented in a claim by the Treasurer, which was a repeat of a newspaper article, to the effect that I had been canvassing the names for the replacement of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. That is not simply a misrepresentation; it is simply and totally wrong. I have not been canvassing, nor would I. Mr Fraser's appointment is a statutory one, as I am sure honourable members would be aware.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second misrepresentation was the assertion that, in a speech which I gave to the Asia-Pacific Bankers Club in Sydney approximately 10 days ago, I blackguarded the Governor of the Reserve Bank and that my remarks were personal to him in some way. That is simply not true. I restated coalition policy in about three lines within the context of a broader speech. We did not cross swords, as has been said in this place. Quite frankly, we did not even cross paths. He made a contribution in a session run by the Bankers Club separate from the session within which I contributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To support my refutation of the claims made, I make just four factual points. Firstly, I was invited to a meeting which was private and in which the participants were asked to speak frankly&mdash;which I did. Secondly, the Chairman of the club wrote to me in a pro forma way but thanked me for my contribution and made no reference to the matter. Thirdly, a press release was issued by the club in which no reference was made to the matter. Fourthly, I have had informal contact from senior sources within the Reserve Bank itself to the effect that they themselves could not understand what all the fuss was about. This contact was made with me about a week after the address which I gave to the Asia-Pacific Bankers Club. In fact, the club to my knowledge has been embarrassed by the fact that the Government has seized upon a leak to misrepresent remarks that I made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As earlier speakers have said, Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) show that the Government is clearly out of control. It has completely lost the plot. Appropriation Bills are being amended with gay abandon while millions of Australians are ruthlessly consigned to the scrap heap of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) believes that if he blasts the Opposition policies, if he blasts the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and if he engages in schoolyard bully boy tactics and public slanging matches, somehow this proves his policies are correct. Like King Canute, who thought he could stop the incoming tide, the Prime Minister believes he can stem the tide of unemployment simply by blasting the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 February last, the Prime Minister delivered yet another economic statement&mdash;his sixteenth attempt to placate the trade unions and their new classmates in the public sector and the single interest lobby groups. At the same time he has embarked on yet another futile and costly venture aimed at kick-starting an increasingly moribund economy. But, doomed to fail since February, the ridiculous One Nation manifesto has been more appropriately renamed `One Broke Nation' and `One Nation Equals Australia's Ruination'. In delivering his judgment on the former Treasurer's latest attempt to bluff the Australian people, P. P. McGuinness summed up thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most curious thing about Paul Keating's mini-Budget is how old fashioned, male oriented and naive it is. </PARA>
<PARA>As usual, Mr McGuinness has got it right. It is hardly surprising that the Prime Minister should have opted for what is basically a 1930s style public works relief program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifteen thousand jobs on the roads and 4,000 on the railways is about all Australia could have expected from a disciple of Jack Lang, although, to be fair to Lang, I believe he was genuinely distressed about the disastrous levels of unemployment that engulfed Australia during the great depressions. There is no doubt that, during the 1890s depression and the depression in the 1930s, Lang's sympathy was for the unemployed and his desire, however misguided, to do something on their behalf was sincere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help thinking how ironic it is that, 60 years after Lang's dismissal by Sir Phillip Game, his protege exhibits no such remorse or concern. Indeed, as the major architect of the current situation&mdash;the man who has given us a million unemployed&mdash;he continues to remain quite unmoved by the plight of the jobless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred years ago working men and women founded the Australian Labor Party. They did so in the hope that their interests would be represented in the Parliament and their children would enjoy a higher standard of living and more opportunities than they had. There is no doubt that these people would be horrified to see the dismal results of their struggles and their personal sacrifices. During the last two decades their Party has been hijacked by the self-interested middle class trendies and the union thugs of the Swanston Street Soviet. It is not difficult to see why, in 1992, Labor has lost its commitment to the unemployed and the blue-collar battlers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Dunkley, youth unemployment is over 50 per cent. How many young people from the Frankston area does the Prime Minister think will get work building roads and railways? The answer, of course, is no-one. The Government recently announced the release of its task program in Dunkley. These are the leaflets that have been distributed. For the task ahead, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can your firm avoid retrenchments?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can your firm avoid going to a shorter working time?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can you keep your firm's skilled staff?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How can your staff upgrade their skills?</PARA>
<PARA>There is one very simple answer which covers each question: call an election; get rid of the Government. That is the way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training and educating our youth is a tremendous idea, but training them for what is the problem. Putting people into training programs&mdash;when we all know there are no job opportunities for them when they finish&mdash;is nothing more than a cruel confidence trick. Worse still, many of these programs simply exist to provide employment for middle class, university educated trainers, Labor's new constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in the One Nation statement that will give even a glimmer of hope to our youth. A generation is about to be condemned to the scrap heap of dependency. A generation is about to be denied the opportunities that have been taken for granted by all Australians since World War II. Our youth, and many older Australians as well, see a society in which there is little incentive to work, little incentive to look after oneself and little incentive to save. They see a nation whose leader denigrates the achievements of the past and who pours scorn on the institutions that safeguard our freedoms and underpin our democratic way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's shameful attack on the flag is, of course, nothing more than a cheap diversionary tactic and a sop to the multicultural industry.

Does the Prime Minister seriously believe that a standard gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide is going to do anything to improve our balance of payments or reduce the size of the national debt?

It was broad support, and I think a lot of people, particularly in the Government, were somewhat taken aback. It is not surprising that that support was forthcoming, because even though fewer than a few thousand people had the chance to study the proposals, they were looking for some sort of alternative, virtually any alternative. I think this was very much the epitome of their concern about the state of the nation as they perceived it.</PARA></TALK.START>

There was a perception of lack of leadership and direction, so it is understandable that many people, not knowing what the issue was all about and what the proposals really meant, were grasping at this alternative. I think that in times of difficulty people will grasp at anything. They were completely unaware of the flaws, the anomalies and the disastrous propositions, which are now slowly being exposed. In recent weeks the attitude has started to change. There has been a waning of support for the Liberal and National parties in the opinion polls, because there has been a growing realisation that the coalition has not been telling the whole story. Bit by bit, the truth is coming out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation policy has now been put forward as an alternative. It was effectively launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and people now see it as a real alternative to the problems.

I suggest that this book should be compulsory reading for all parliamentarians. It should also be read by every journalist, by every Treasury official and by all Australians who are concerned for and interested in their country's future. He is one of the growing legion of economic, political and social justice commentators who now have no doubts about the savage and detrimental effects of the Fightback package on the vast majority of Australian individuals and families. </PARA>

He points out that New Zealand introduced it in 1985 at 10 per cent, but then went to 12.5 per cent; Britain increased it from 15 per cent to 17 per cent; and many, like Ireland, went over the 20 per cent mark. Ireland went to 23 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has also raised the issue of the high cost of collecting this tax and declares that it is inefficient because it could cost about 11 per cent of all the revenue just to collect it. He warns that the application of the GST will significantly increase prices. This must be a warning to every family, and in particular to every woman in this society, because women are the ones who in most instances have to carry the wallet or the purse to buy the food that the families eat. He points out that the GST is unfair because it ignores the capacity of people to pay the tax. He points out that it is a heavy burden on low and middle income people. As I said, he claims it is inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also argues that the GST will be good only for those who are earning $80,000 a year or more.

There will be a tax on freight, on travel and on all those services that people just cannot get on the phone and ring up the guy next door to provide. Providers have to come miles and miles to deliver those services. There will be a tax on every product they use. There will be a tax on housing and a higher cost of living for people in isolated and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also points out that the Fightback package will seriously hurt the retired, the superannuated and those on fixed incomes.

He says that small businesses will be the big losers, for they will not benefit from the so-called compensatory advantages of a payroll tax. In Queensland no business pays payroll tax unless it has a payroll of more than $500,000 a year. He also makes the point that they will be bearing the burden of collecting it, and will be legally responsible for that collection. It is a cost that they will not be compensated for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He accuses the Opposition also of `Goebelling'. I thought this was a very good term.

He points out also that the Opposition has gone to extreme lengths to cloud the issues and make out that the situation is far worse than it is. He points out, for instance, that, whilst the Opposition is saying that Australia is a high-taxed nation, in a United Nations survey Australia comes out as the third lowest taxed country of all the OECD nations. </PARA>

<PARA>I suggest that it is important that, like the Canadians, Australians need to understand and realise how regressive, costly, inefficient and unfair a GST would be for the people of this country. It is a tax on everything they eat, on everything they wear, on everything they use. It is a tax on all goods and services. It is a tax on school books, a tax on school shoes, a tax on legal services. It is a tax on all the domestic services that we take for granted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be a tax on child-care. I raise this matter specifically because it is one that those opposite have tried to hedge and fudge on. They intend to eliminate the fee relief scheme that this Government has been pursuing. They intend to end grants to community groups that provide child-care. They intend, instead, to have tax deductibility for the payments that people will make for child-care. As one would appreciate, this will benefit only the rich. It will affect hundreds of thousands of low and middle income families. It is going to hurt the working mothers. It is going to adversely affect the privately owned centres, which are gaining because of our policies to give fee relief to people who go to privately owned centres.

The Opposition has kept quiet about it, and we can understand why. It has failed, just as it has in the other areas. It has failed to talk about the domestic services tax; it has failed to talk about taxes on legal services and accountancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have also failed to talk about the tax on LPG. It is quite amazing. They talk about how motorists are going to gain, but what they do not tell the people is that there is no excise duty on LPG. Whether LPG is used in the home or in the car, there is no tax on gas.

Petrol may be cheaper if excise is totally removed, but what is sure is that LPG will be dearer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great cover-up relates to superannuation. It has been so well done. I have to give the Opposition full marks for the way it has handled it. It has even confused and, in some parts, converted members of the consumer movement who are members of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. Those members, inadequately, unfairly&mdash;wrongly, at least&mdash;put out a release supporting what the Liberal and National parties have done. They obviously did not take the time to go through the detail. The superannuation scheme that the Opposition is putting forward must worry the heck out of anyone who at the moment is 48 or 50 or 51 or 52 and has been planning to retire at 55. There are dozens, in fact hundreds if not thousands, of people in the community who have been paying into superannuation, who have had their roll-overs protected, and whose plan has been to retire at 55. The Liberals and the Nationals say that they will not be able to. The Liberals and Nationals say that people will not be able to retire before they are 60 and, if they try to, if they dare to, then they will bear a massive additional tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has also put limits on the amount of superannuation lump sum that people can take. At the moment, under our Government's plans, a person pays no tax at all on the first $80,000 lump sum. All that a person pays is a special 15 per cent tax on the rest of the lump sum entitlement up to what is called the reasonable benefits limit. That is simply worked out by multiplying one's average salary over three years by seven. So a miner on $50,000 is eligible for $350,000. No tax is paid on the first $80,000 and only 15 per cent tax on the rest up to $350,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition says that the limit to start with will be $60,000. In order to get up to the Opposition's maximum of $300,000, a person will need to have an entitlement of $540,000. It is quite disgusting that this Opposition is prepared to try to destroy the total concept of superannuation. It is not only doing it by saying that people cannot retire at 55; it is not only doing it by putting an extra tax burden on people who take their money before 60 years of age; it is not only doing it by making it more difficult in terms of the way that people get at their money, be it in a roll-over. It is going to tax the funds even more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a 15 per cent tax at the moment on the earnings of funds. The Opposition intends to make that 25 per cent. So for every $1m that a fund may have to distribute to all those who have been investing, there would be only $750,000 to distribute&mdash;75 per cent. The rest would go in a tax under a Liberal-National government. Moreover, the Opposition is going to make it hard for employers who want to contribute to a superannuation scheme for their employees. It is going to tax the contributions, and then it is going to start to discriminate between those who are self-employed and who are employees, and the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The self-employed person is only allowed to contribute to a superannuation fund up to $6,000. For that contribution, that person gets a tax rebate of 25 per cent. But that is not for the employer. The employer will have the unlimited right, the unfettered right, to contribute anything it wants for itself in superannuation&mdash;and the Opposition is going to tax the contributions that the employer makes on behalf of the employee. It is no wonder that the superannuation firms, employee groups, various professional organisations, the solicitors, doctors, bank managers and everyone else, are saying, `Hey! What are they proposing?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those people who are looking forward to their retirement right now, the Opposition is even going to introduce a deeming concept. So, if an ordinary worker takes $120,000 and wants to renovate his home, go on a holiday or buy a new car, under the Opposition's proposal, before he can get a pension, the Opposition is going to look at what he has spent his money on. It is possible that the Opposition will deem the expenditure; in other words, it will pretend that the person has still got it even though he has spent it, and the Opposition will use an assets test to prevent that person getting his full pension entitlement. This would not hurt the rich but it would hurt the low income earners, the ordinary workers who have small superannuation entitlements and who, when they retire, want to go on a holiday, want to give something to their kids, want to renovate their home or want to do something with a beach house, or something to that effect. Those people will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whichever way one looks at it, the Liberal and National parties have put forward an insidious type of scheme in superannuation.

In fact, it will destroy the very concept of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It amazes me that the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations was duped.

But once one gets to the detail one finds that people start to understand what it means to them, and what it means for the man who is 51 years of age and who has been looking forward to his retirement in four years time. Under a Liberal-National Party government he will have to wait until he is 60. Even when people wait until they are 60, if they have been changing jobs over recent years and have roll-overs or investments in other funds, they will not be able to take the full lump sum. Even though they have had it there and have not been using it and have been very careful about their savings and their investments, they will be limited to a maximum of $300,000, which is going to prevent a lot of people from doing the things they want to do in retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) leaves, I think he might listen to a couple of bits of information I can give him. The first thing I would like to tell him is that in the reasonably near future I will be visiting his electorate, and I thank him very much for his remarks today because I can go into Capricornia and tell people that he is opposed to reducing his constituents' petrol costs by 19c a litre. I heard him rabbit on about how costs are going to increase for country people. It shows how much time he spends in his electorate because if he did so he would know, as I do, of the huge cost of petrol even in a city such as Cairns where people have to drive long distances through lack of public transport, electric trains and other things.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People use motor cars in the bush, and that particular situation is going to make it vastly better for country people.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the other point I am about to touch on because I, unlike the honourable member for Capricornia, have run a trucking business. I can give him figures which I took out 15 years ago showing that the sales tax on my tyres cost me 50c a tonne to transport goods 1,000 miles. I notice the honourable member is scurrying out of the chamber because he does not like to hear the truth of the circumstances. He is locked into his Party's ideology. He is not entitled to represent truly the people of one of the most remote areas of Australia where fuel costs and freight costs are paramount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who has operated a trucking business, I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is my considered estimate that the Fightback package will lower the cost of operating a truck by 20 per cent. That is a substantial amount of money, and it will be reflected in lower freight rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the honourable member for Capricornia is under the thumb of the trade union movement and of his front bench, and he has to put his knuckles to his forehead whenever they suggest something to him, but one would think he would keep quiet in Parliament. One would think he would not give endorsement to a proposal, to a defence, that says, `Let's continue to tax the people of remote areas 26c a litre on their fuel and index it to inflation every six months'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. He went on to say that small business will not be affected by the removal of payroll tax because in many cases small business does not pay it directly. That is the truth. But he did not bother to tell small businesses that everything they buy into their shops, every service they get by way of transport and every major company that services their small businesses, is paying that $6 billion in payroll tax. Do you think that Big Business is saying, `Gee, those poor old little fellers down there; we won't pass on the cost of the $6 billion'? Of course it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at another fact about the people who live in the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. By their very geographical location they get higher wages. One fellow from my electorate wrote to me the other day saying, `I am earning $1,200 a week working in a mine 12 hours a day. I am taking home $100 a week better than my family would get if I was on the dole'. This is because of the tax burden he must meet at that level under this Government's high tax regime. He is a decent man. He went back to work after Christmas&mdash;but I can tell the Government that he had thoughts about it. He had done the sums. Sometimes you might say, `Could you blame him?' I was able to write to that man and show him how Fightback would reduce his personal tax bill by $158 a week. That would no doubt encourage him to stay at work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the honourable member for Capricornia is rabbiting on, the very people he represents, those who get higher wages to compensate for higher costs of living, are paying those massive taxes imposed by this Government, which blow up after one has earned about $30,000, if I remember rightly. From $20,000 a year one pays 38c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members might remember when there was a great push in this country from certain quarters for a flat tax rate&mdash;same tax on every dollar one earned. The magical figure that used to get floated around was 20 per cent. So I went to the Fightback tax table. I calculated that, of course, one would pay no tax on $7,000 a year under that table. One would pay 16.2c on the next $13,700 and then 30c on all the rest up to $50,000. I know some people think that sounds a lot of money, but in the remote areas such as those represented by the honourable member for Capricornia people do get those sorts of incomes as ordinary wage earners. When I calculated the tax at those rates and averaged it into $50,000, it came out at 22c flat, almost what that particular push wanted. Of course, if one is on only $20,000, it is less than 16c. It is about 12c, I suppose. I have not done that calculation. What did this Government say in its One Nation policy?  It said, `If you are on less than $20,000 a year&mdash;tough. You are probably silly enough to vote for us anyway. Why should we try to buy your support back?'. That includes the honourable member for Capricornia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been plenty of evidence in this place&mdash;it is not long ago that I lost a vote in this Parliament 118 to two&mdash;that I have got my priorities right. I vote according to the welfare of the people who put their faith in me when they cast their vote. I can tell the Government that that does not do much for one's political future. But the simple fact of life is that it is time the honourable member for Capricornia stopped standing up in this place, properly analysed the policies and said, `How will they affect the people in my electorate?'. I can tell him that the removal of growing fuel taxes will be a substantial benefit, as will be the reduction in personal income tax and the other benefits. A complaint coming out of the bush for decades has been that they pay sales tax on freight, and in many cases that is what they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been accused of `Goebbelling'. I laughed. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was at it again today, saying that the Opposition's policies will throw the unemployed on the streets. One can go back through pages and pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and find exactly those words. The Prime Minister is reminded every time by the back bench of this Party that that statement is untrue&mdash;and he knows it&mdash;but it does not stop him from using it. `Repeat an untruth often enough and it eventually gets believed' is a trademark of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that I stood off at arm's length from a goods and services tax for a long time. I would not have accepted a goods and services tax as a new tax, an additional tax, in the tax arrangements of Australia, be it brought forward by the Liberal Party or anyone else. But, when I sat in our party room and saw what the trade-offs were, how appropriate those measures were and how much better balanced an overall consumption tax would be, I changed my position. I have done it publicly. I want people to know that I am not here supporting a goods and services tax in isolation;  I am here supporting the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for someone to hold up a shirt or something of that nature; whingeing Wendy will be back on the television giving us the story of the shirt or the loaf of bread on which a tax of 15 per cent will be applied, which will be the case. But, of course, other things will cost less because of the other cost reductions under this plan. One cannot look at it that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in business most of my life and I have a slightly different perspective of how one reads a balance sheet. If someone wants to sell me his business, I do not necessarily go through the voluminous pages. I go to the bottom line. I say, `How much money did you make last year?'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I thought I would take a quick calculation of the bottom line for the Australian taxpayer after the introduction of the Fightback package. What did I get?  On present day figures&mdash;and let us hope that the recession eventually ends and wholesale sales tax recovers in a way. I do not like to see tax increase in any way, but the Government's current collections on wholesale sales tax are substantially down due to the recession. They are down on its estimate. Taking the actual figures which the Opposition used, we will remove $9,500m worth of wholesale sales tax, $13,000m worth of income tax, $6,600m worth of fuel tax and $6,000m worth of payroll tax. I think that adds up to about $35 billion. When I examine the other papers on the Fightback, I see an estimate that the GST will raise $27 billion. It does not matter how you want to make the mix. The bottom line is that the taxpayers collectively are $8 billion better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia wants to tell us, of course, that only the rich will get that. The tables that are produced in this Fightback pamphlet are quite different from that, of course. They give clear evidence of what people on very low incomes will get. They give very clear examples of the sort of compensation that some people will get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was driving around in my car the other day and I heard a woman ring in. We have had a few jokes in this House. We had the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), when he was briefly Treasurer, making great fun of a supermarket document which said amongst other things that a typical shopping basket might contain four cans of pet food. He went on, I think, to say&mdash;his great one-liner, reported religiously by some reporters who also do not go to supermarkets or ever look in their wives' grocery trolleys&mdash;`If you are prepared to live on dog food and Harpic, you will be all right'.  He thought it was very funny. I chose to write to one of the journalists who bothered to copy this statement without using his brains, and I pointed out that, if one ever wants to go and see what sells in a supermarket, one should take a tape measure and measure the length of shelf space allocated to that particular item. Around election time members of parliament seem to visit supermarkets more frequently, but I do it a bit more frequently than that. Anybody who walks in will find that the pet food section covers metres, as do the various soaps and detergents. This is evidence of the amount people buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for people to ring up and say, `I only buy one bottle of detergent every month to six weeks'. They probably do; but then they buy something else. To suggest, for instance, that a typical family with a pet does not buy four tins of pet food shows how little the now Minister for Finance understands what is in a typical family's shopping basket. The Government is out of touch. The figures were pretty correct. Of course, they were too isolated in themselves to be typical, and that supermarket did not sell everything. It did not sell motor cars, which of course will fall in price under a GST. That is the point: one has to average it out. We know what the averages have come to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is getting away from me and I have only commented on the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia and his book&mdash;one man's opinion. I want to make a couple of points about Question Time today and the role of the Prime Minister in this debate on protection. Today I thought, `The Prime Minister is pretty good; he's a pretty good talker. He can nearly convince people that black is white'. But it was amazing to hear him suggest today that a word like `altogether' apparently has some other meaning. He then cast aspersions on the John Laws show. That has been his principal policy platform for years. He gets special rights there; he gets on it when others cannot. The simple fact is that what he says there is for public consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth putting on the record again&mdash;particularly as I well remember his embarrassment today&mdash;that on the John Laws show, when referring to tariffs, he said;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the phase-in, which is 1997 and 2000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is very specific, but of course, the 1997 mark is now the only one the Prime Minister wants to talk about, when tariffs get to 5 per cent and 15 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we will have removed tariffs altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If anyone in this House or anyone listening can put any interpretation upon that apart from a great big nought&mdash;the fourth nought in the year 2000&mdash;I would like him to contact me. It is clear, it is unequivocal and it was where the Prime Minister stood before the Wills by-election. There is nothing wrong with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister boasts about his achievements in this place. Most of the economic reforms he has achieved have come about because we in the Opposition have supported him. If there is any reason why some of our reforms did not get up it is that when he was in opposition he would never have been so economically rational. Today we see the Government wanting to get into the privatisation area. But we well remember that when it suited the Government, when campaigning in a particular election, we had the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister calling `privatisation' the foulest of words. It is on the record. It needs to be remembered that most of this Prime Minister's achievements came about because this Opposition said, `It's good for Australia and we will not play politics with it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now identify the substantial difference between two political parties, of which one, notwithstanding the fact that there is a Wills by-election, is standing by its tariff policy and the other&mdash;namely, the Government&mdash;thinks maybe it wants to rethink it. But there is another major difference. This difference is the reason why our policy will work and be beneficial and why the Government's policy is a definition of impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is&mdash;and it was repeated by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in a press release I read today&mdash;that we tell industry that first we will get the parameters right. First, we will introduce our Fightback package, which is a package of tax reform which will take billions of dollars off industry costs&mdash;probably more than the present value of tariffs. Having done that, the Opposition will give industry a chance to have an efficient work force. Someone may say that that means we will pay it half. That is not what we are talking about; we are talking about employers being able to give appropriate wage packages to individuals in their employ, relative to their productivity and their ability, so that we do not have the lowest common denominator as a means of encouraging people to work. We expect a lot of employees to earn more. We expect that, under that arrangement, employers will want to work two or three shifts, and with the same capital equipment, this will create a lot more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very conscious of the phrase we have used constantly which suggests that our employment policy is about prosperity through productivity. When we have done those things&mdash;and we give ourselves a timetable for this&mdash;we are confident of reaching our target of neutral, nil tariffs by the year 2000. We do not have to be frightened of it; we do not have to duck out of it because there is a Wills by-election. When we do that&mdash;of course, the Fightback package will be implemented first; the sweets will come before the spinach&mdash;industry will not be frightened of overseas competition, be that import competition or export competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has to be understood. It is in black and white. It is in the policy. It has been restated by our Leader today. That is in stark contrast to the Prime Minister, who is back-pedalling again because he wants to keep his job. He spent $300m of taxpayers' money convincing the left wing to vote him into the leadership and now with his One Nation policy he will borrow another $20 billion of taxpayers' money to try to get an expenditure-led recovery. He wants to spend us out of trouble, having learnt that that did not work in the 1980s; whereas we want Australia to work its way out of trouble. That is the difference. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter of considerable importance, not merely to this Parliament but to all the Australian people and particularly those who are members of trade unions. In my remarks I want to refer to the grandiose plans which we have heard from the coalition in terms of its concept of industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industrial relations practice as it exists in Australia at the present time has emerged over many years from a period of industrial confrontation to an emphasis, through the creation of industrial tribunals, to negotiation, conciliation and awards which provide just terms and agreements with a concept of providing Australian workers with a reasonable living wage. There are a variety of awards, and the whole emphasis is upon negotiation. I think, quite properly, that strikes or lock-outs should be seen as a breakdown in these relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of that, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made a number of suggestions which represent the coalition's new approach to industrial relations. Under the coalition, there will be no more national wage cases; there will be no more wage increases which, in the Opposition's terms, are not matched by improved performance. And undoubtedly that is a standard which will not apply to Opposition members' behaviour in this House. Negotiations will be at the workplace level&mdash;and it is a somewhat novel concept to have an unemployed worker trying to negotiate a deal when unemployment levels are high. There will be longer working weeks and the abolition of penalty rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just the agenda of the coalition; it is a major break from the traditions of the past, and the Opposition is proud of it. It is in fact the agenda of the New Right of the coalition and it demonstrates the influence of the New Right in the area of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recently had a situation in Victoria which was raised in this Parliament on a number of occasions by members of the coalition. I refer to the dispute that took place at the Camperdown abattoir. That abattoir was purchased by Famicorp Pty Ltd for $1.4m in May 1991. Prior to the purchase, Famicorp had not been involved in the meat industry in Australia. Following the purchase of the works, its solicitors proposed to members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union that work should commence at the abattoir upon terms and conditions which were substantially below those that generally prevailed throughout Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solicitors made it clear that they wanted substantially lower wages and substantially increased workloads with the tallies; they removed the requirement for consultation on the composition of work teams;  and they allowed the employer to discriminate in relation to employment practices. At that stage that company was no more than a shelf company with a paid up capital of $2. When the employees at Camperdown rightly rejected these proposals, Famicorp attempted to provide non-award contract labour and entered into a contract with Troubleshooters Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was clearly a breakdown in industrial relations, but at that point it then emerged that senior Liberal Party figures and the Victorian Farmers Federation became publicly involved in this dispute. We had the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Kroger; we had the honourable member for Higgins, Mr Costello; we had a member of the Victorian shadow Cabinet, Mr Phil Gude; and we had the Farmers Federation supporting a rally and arguing strongly for the use of contract labour at the works. I will not dwell on that, but basically the arguments used there were used in this Parliament. We were told that this was an opportunity to test or to see the new program of the Opposition in terms of workplace agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail, attitude and involvement, and the nature of what occurred, at Camperdown were outlined in a magistrate's court only recently when one member of the Union, a Shane Francis Reilly, was charged with breaches of the law in respect of actions arising out of the picketing. Let me say at the outset that one of the fundamental rights of organised labour in a democracy is the right to strike, the right to picket, and if in the course of those actions breaches of the law take place, those who are involved have to face the consequences. No-one argues about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned, though, about what emerged. This was not just a simple exercise between a contractor who was out to break union conditions and awards and the owners of the company simply being cheered on by prominent members of the coalition. It emerged that Mr Kroger, the President of the Liberal Party in Victoria and one who has prominently involved himself in the sacking of members of the Liberal Party in this Parliament and replacing them with people of his own political thought who are members of the New Right&mdash;the honourable member for Higgins being probably the prime example of that&mdash;in order to observe, which is putting the most neutral term one could find on it, engaged a Mr Leeson, a private investigator, to observe what took place during this dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from being an independent and objective observer, Mr Leeson admitted under cross-examination, and under oath, that his purpose was to prepare material to enable Mr Kroger as a solicitor to then hopefully institute, presumably on behalf of Famicorp, an action for damages along the lines of the Dollar Sweets case. The problem that Mr Kroger and the coalition face is what we are seeing in practice, what occurs and what is really meant by the attitude and policy of the coalition in terms of their industrial relations program. The fact is that in cross-examination Mr Leeson admitted convictions of a serious nature, for impersonating a Federal police officer, for embezzlement and for a series of offences which involved larceny and unlawful pawning, on all of which he was convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How a man with that kind of criminal record comes to hold a police licence, I do not know. How a man with that record is sponsored and promoted by the President of the Victorian Branch of the Liberal Party, I do not know. But we do know, because it emerges clearly from the evidence given to the court, that Mr Leeson was not a simple, objective observer of the events at Camperdown. He acted in the role of an agent provocateur. He was party to, and clearly approved of, acts of assault, one of a grievous kind, against individual picketers. He did all he could on as many occasions as he could to inflame the temper of what was clearly a fragile industrial relationship. He finished up admitting on oath that he told lies, that he deliberately stirred up picketers, that he threw eggs at them, and that he was perfectly happy when John Beaton, a unionist, was brutally bashed with an iron bar by associates of Leeson, and that he, Leeson, placed an effigy of Beaton's scarred head in his office window in the view of the picketers, with a sign, `Egghead Beaton beaten'. That is the man who was employed by the President of the Liberal Party and who has been promoted within offices of the Victorian Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone back to a situation in which the people who talk about the industrial relations club have turned industrial relations into a situation almost akin to trench warfare. Of course, what in fact happened, on his sworn evidence in respect of the prosecution of Mr Reilly, was that Leeson's evidence was totally rejected by the magistrate because there were videos taken of the scenes and the events showing that Mr Leeson had lied under oath. The magistrate found that Mr Reilly had no case to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter not because it is a simple exercise of one side against another but because here we have a prominent member of the Liberal Party, the President of the Victorian Branch, a solicitor, not only choosing to involve himself in an industrial dispute but clearly doing so for the purposes, as was said on oath by his agent provocateur, of collecting evidence to enable another legal case to be launched, presumably by Mr Kroger on behalf of a company. So Mr Kroger was not only involved politically but was involved in trying to make a financial gain. In so doing he employed a man with criminal convictions, a man who could not be believed on oath. This became something of a Liberal Party cause celebre. This is the Opposition's new industrial relations policy in action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When Mr Leeson came to court he lied, and that is clear, and he lied about the incidents about which he gave evidence. More importantly, he exposed the nature of what the coalition means when it talks about its new industrial relations policy. I ask honourable members to think about it. This is the coalition that wants to move from a process of industrial negotiation and conciliation, that talks of people who have acted for employers&mdash;men of integrity and honesty who one does not necessarily agree with but who are described by the coalition as part of an industrial relations club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask: what kind of club is Mr Kroger trying to create?  What kind of infamy are we seeing when a prominent member of the Liberal Party uses a man with criminal convictions to act in a way which will inflame an industrial dispute, where there is already some sensitivity, for the purposes not only of political gain but also of personal gain; when he will involve members of this Parliament, shadow Ministers, whom he has promoted within the Party using his position as the Liberal President; and when he involves State shadow Ministers to rally to the cause?  What is the cause?  The cause is to clearly project the policy of the New Right in terms of industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the average decent Australian unionist and the average fair-minded Australian employer whether they want to see their workplaces subject to this kind of industrial confrontation. Do they want to see the bashing and the lies of known perjurers and criminals who are placed into these situations for the purposes of fabricating evidence and destroying any possible basis for a properly developed industrial negotiation?  That is the tragic court record. If any member of the coalition wants to see the notes that were taken at that hearing, I would be only too happy to make them available. I do not believe that within the coalition these facts sit easily. I believe that if the Leader of the Opposition is serious, he will repudiate this concept. I believe that the shadow Minister with the responsibility of dealing with industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), a man for whom I have some respect, would repudiate these actions. And repudiate them, they should!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this whole tragic and stupid exercise, the only people who seem to have got any productivity improvement out of the situation are the lawyers. The non-union labour that was employed came largely from outside Camperdown and had very little experience of the requirements that are necessary for the export of meat. After all of this confrontation, what happened? There was hardly a carcass that could be approved for overseas export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, Troubleshooters' lawyers will, at least, get something, because they are now suing the owner of Camperdown abattoir for non-payment for the provision of its somewhat incompetent labour. What a farce of an industrial relations policy! It cannot stand up in the meat industry or anywhere else. The policies of industrial thuggery will fail. They cannot be substituted for the productivity improvements gained through genuine consultation and negotiation with the union movement through the accord process&mdash;such as the ACTU supported agreements between the meatworkers union and key Victorian meat producers, such as O'Connors, Herds, BCI, Don's and Gilbertsons. The only real future for industrial relations in Australia lies in enterprise bargaining which is based on genuine representative negotiations between the unions and employers and which retains minimum standards through the maintenance of awards and national wage cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that the Krogers of the world and the New Right, operating as it does within the coalition, will accept a policy of cooperation in preference to their anti-union, anti-worker agenda. They do not even back down from support of those who break the law to provoke picketers, perjure themselves or glorify violence against workers exercising their basic right to strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this issue of Mr Leeson's employment was put to Mr Kroger in a radio interview on 18 March, Mr Kroger maintained his support for this man, this agent provocateur and this supporter of violence.

Does this violence form part of a so-called free choice that workers will be given as to whether they enter into individual contracts in preference to award employment or not?

I think that is a pretty fair summation. If I might relate what he has been saying to Labor's One Nation policy, I would say that One Nation will never succeed, just as Labor will go out at the next election, because the Labor Party is basing it on divisiveness. What we have to do as Australians is get together. We cannot go on with this tirade that the previous speaker engaged in. We have to get together and work together. We have to work as one people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the Appropriation Bills before the House. In particular, I want to speak about Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92, which, as honourable members are well aware, seeks funding for labour market program assistance to job seekers in industry of $87m; residential care for older people of $50m&mdash;I must say that one of my prime interests is in the care of the aged in my electorate and indeed around Australia; and child-care fee relief of $66m. It is interesting that apart from $23m of the child-care fee relief funding, all of these amounts already appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I do not know what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government's financial planning and its budgetary control have gone so out of kilter, and it has mucked it up so much, that while we are debating cognately Appropriation Bills (No. 3) and (No. 4), we are also debating Appropriation Bill (No. 5), which includes the same amounts and the same funding as that included in the other Bills. Later when Appropriation Bill (No. 5) is disposed of, the Government will be introducing amendments to remove from Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) what is in Appropriation Bill (No. 5). That is evidence of pretty bad financial management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder, too, why the Government did not know about this funding crisis. Obviously that is what it is, because it is running out of money. It has said that the original Appropriation Bills would have difficulty in getting through the Senate in time to provide the money. Of course, the Senate is not holding up these Appropriation Bills;  they are going along quite well, quite fairly, under the normal circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask:  why did the Government not know about its funding crisis four weeks ago?  The fact that it did not certainly implies and demonstrates that it really does not know what is going on. Of course, I wonder&mdash;I have no evidence of this&mdash;whether the special Appropriation Bill has been introduced because the Government has run out of money and it does not have enough money in the approved funds for the $370m recession bribe that it will provide by way of the additional one-off payments for the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, I think it is absolutely correct to say that we are debating this Bill now because of the Government's mismanagement, its financial bungling.

The Department of Finance of this Government was in breach of the Constitution.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very difficult to believe, but I must believe the Australian National Audit Office. The Department of Finance also failed to keep separate records for its superannuation schemes, in breach of the Audit Act. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already made reference to the `we are sorry for the recession' family allowance payment which is due on 2 April. I really believe that it should probably have been paid on 1 April, because it is an April fool's joke. But the people of Australia are not fools, and the people of Australia will not be fooled by this one-off payment which, as I said, is a `sorry for the recession' payment.  That will not bring about an economic miracle of biblical proportions. It will allow a few people in dire straits to pay a bill or two, but that is all. It will not get them a job;  it will not get them out of the financial difficulty that so many of our fellow Australians are in. The families who get the payment will welcome the extra income. It will not drum up a recession beating spending spree, and most of the money will be used to pay existing bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no argument with the Government's apologising for the recession. I believe it should do it even more clearly. I suppose that for Australian families cash in hand is one way of saying sorry;  but the Government should stand up and have the intestinal fortitude to admit to what it has done and what the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has done, particularly in his period as Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the families who will get the extra family allowance, particularly those who are unemployed&mdash;I think about 60 per cent of the unemployed people will be getting it&mdash;they really want a job. That $370m of family allowance payments will not create lasting jobs. It is just a bit of pump priming, which is really vote buying. The Wills by-election is coming up one week after the cheques go out. Is that not interesting?  Is that a coincidence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, there are three major issues concerning Australians:  jobs, jobs and more jobs. What we  have with the Government's One Nation package is concern for one job, and that is the job of the present Prime Minister. I was interested  earlier in the debate to hear a Government member say with great joy that the people of Australia had recognised the value of its One Nation package, its `One Job' package, its `One Broke Nation' package. I think he was right. Australians have recognised the value of it and they recognise that there is very little in it at all. In fact, it has sunk without trace because it is a fraud, a flop, a fizzer. There is an allocation of $2.3 billion in the first year and $20 billion over four years. Every cent of the $20 billion is borrowed money. Every move in One Nation is unfunded. It will put up Australia's debt even more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also really concerned about the way that those on the Government side are using scare tactics about Fightback. Of course, I and other members know that between now and the next election the Government will concentrate its attention on the one thing that has come out already. Government members will go around to all Australians and say, `Look out, look out, look out;  they will put on this dreadful goods and services tax, an extra 15 per cent'. They will say, as they have said already, `Everything you put in your mouth, another 15 per cent'. But that is wrong; it is not true. They will say, `Everything you put on your back, another 15 per cent'. Again, that is wrong. </PARA>

If they are having a beer at the pub, they are paying 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that, too. If they are at home having a glass of wine or a scotch, they have paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that, too. But the Government will not tell them that. It says, `Oh no, you will get this dreadful extra tax'. We will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people had a shower this morning and used some soap, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on that soap. If they cleaned their teeth, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the toothpaste. Presumably people wanted to look moderately well groomed before they went to work, to school or somewhere else, and would have combed their hair. They paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the comb as well. If men who do not grow a beard had a shave, they paid 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on the shaving items, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government cannot, and must not, try to scare the Australian people with this false and untrue statement about a 15 per cent tax on everything. It is not true. People who drove to work this morning should know that there is a 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on car parts and on motor oil. Everything will not go up by 15 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Government's figures on Fightback?  It has cooked the books and fiddled the figures. When the analysis of Fightback was carried out Labor changed the base figures. Everything that went into Fightback was done on current costs with a 3.5 per cent rate of inflation. But when the Government tried to compare and analyse Fightback, it was done at 7.6 per cent inflation, more than double. Of course one gets a different figure.

That is how employment figures are derived. But did Labor use that?  No, all the kids at school were included. The Government is very proud of the fact that the percentage of children staying at school has grown enormously since Labor has been in. Quite frankly, I applaud that, providing that they are genuine students. But it often seems to me that children are being paid to stay at school just to reduce the unemployment figures. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should not think for one minute that I attack&mdash;because I do not&mdash;the proposition that Australians should be well schooled and well educated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bills before the House. Unlike the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), I am convinced that the initiatives outlined in the One Nation economic statement of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will successfully get this country on its feet and see it into a period of growth and prosperity. I was particularly proud of the initiatives in the statement which will benefit Australia's small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the honourable member for Cowper started to refer to small business, I naturally thought he had read our One Nation package. Obviously he has not, because if he had he would have found that small business has been the real winner in One Nation, as our Government has continued to recognise the key role small business has to play in Australia's recovery from the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses are defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Bureau of Industry Economics as businesses which employ fewer than 100 people in the manufacturing sector or fewer than 20 people in other non-agricultural sectors. The small business sector in Australia comprises a diverse range of business enterprises. According to the first annual report on small business in Australia, which was released in 1991:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses participate directly in, or support, all economic activity in Australia, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing and construction, and service industries such as the retail trade, finance and property services and the hospitality industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Approximately 57 per cent of all non-agricultural small enterprises operating in Australia are in the retail trade, finance, property and business services and the construction industry, while more than 90 per cent of the total number of firms in most industry classifications are also small businesses. As stated in the annual report to which I referred:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small firms account for 72.1 per cent of total employment in the construction industry. They also dominate total employment in the recreation, personal and other service industries, in the retail trade, and in transport and storage industries . . . Overall, small businesses provide around 48 per cent of private sector employment&mdash;jobs for more than two million Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>This Government is giving greater recognition to small business interests in the development of economic and industry policies, and the initiatives in One Nation certainly prove that point. Small businesses have certain opportunities and advantages over large enterprises. This Government recognises that those small businesses can play an important part in Australia's economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, we are making efforts to improve the efficiency and performance of small businesses to ensure that enterprises which, by their nature, are likely to remain small, are able to operate productively and efficiently. This Government is also ensuring that new and innovative businesses, with high growth potential, are able to realise that potential and make a strong contribution to Australia's industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector has a lot to offer Australia in its attempt to improve economic performance. It is an important source of innovation. It adapts quickly to changing market conditions and contributes to the flexibility and dynamism of the economy. Small businesses also tend to spawn entrepreneurial spirit and they provide a large part of the economic infrastructure necessary for industrial growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has tried to be as responsive as possible to the needs and the concerns of small business. It was this Labor Government which decided to set up a parliamentary committee to investigate the requirements of small business in Australia. In November 1990, following extensive consultation with the small business sector, that committee presented its recommendations. The committee's response acknowledged the vital importance of small enterprises to Australia's economic development and, as a result, this Government accepted that there was a need to tailor industry policies to cater to small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package proves that the Keating Labor Government acknowledges that one of its basic responsibilities is to create an environment that encourages businesses to succeed and to grow. We, as a government, also recognise that for many small businesses on very tight budgets government policies and regulations can mean the difference between their success and failure. This recognition of the problems of small business has not come as a bolt from the blue. Rather, it follows concerted efforts by our Government and particularly by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) to hold lengthy and continuing consultations with the small business sector. Over the past 12 months in particular the Government, along with the small business unit and the small business council, has been raising the awareness of small business issues within Commonwealth departments and agencies, and that is to the benefit of the small entrepreneurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package could not have come at a better time for small business in Australia. The small business sector is extremely responsive to changes in economic conditions and demand patterns, and the recent contraction in economic activity in Australia has placed severe pressure on small businesses, particularly in rural areas. The annual report on small business in Australia provides, I believe, a very accurate summary of the calamity small businesses in Australia face. One part of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1990, the combination of lower commodity prices and a relatively high Australian dollar adversely affected the viability of small businesses in regional centres. The situation was exacerbated in Queensland and northern New South Wales by drought and flood, which leads to pressures on farm incomes and reduced demand for goods and services in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, as this report clearly shows, no State or Territory in Australia has escaped the trauma of the recession. Following consultations with the small business sector, our Prime Minister's One Nation statement holds some very important initiatives to help kick-start the economy and encourage the growth of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main initiatives in the economic statement affecting small business are: taxation reforms, which include a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small and growing businesses, which will increase capital mobility and growth in this sector; a nine-week extension for 1991-92 company tax payments for small business; and the introduction of pooled development funds to substantially increase equity capital available to small and medium sized companies. We also find that it includes a tripling of funding support to $12m, assisting small and medium enterprises entering export markets through the export access program. It has changes to banking regulations to allow banks to write off loans to troubled businesses trying to trade their way out of difficulties, and commitments from banks to expand their lending. It also says that there will be no increase until 1994-95 in the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives are in response to recommendations from the parliamentary committee's report and concerns voiced by the small business sector and the small business coalition. The small business coalition is composed of 35 businesses and professional organisations and has worked constructively with the Government in an attempt to raise the profile of small and medium businesses in Australia and address any structural impediments so as to allow small business to contribute to new industries, to export and thus employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the report from the parliamentary committee on small business, taxation remains the area of greatest concern to the small business community. The tax reforms outlined in the economic statement go a long way in realising the recommendations of the committee and the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current exemption from capital gains tax for 20 per cent of the goodwill realised on the sale of a small business will be increased to 50 per cent in respect of disposals of goodwill on or after 27 February 1992. The eligibility ceiling has also been increased from $1m to $2m of net business interest. This ceiling will be indexed annually from 1 July 1993 against the CPI to ensure that this significant tax relief measure is not eroded over time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reducing the tax paid on the disposal of goodwill, the measures will facilitate greater capital mobility in the small business sector and improve the ability of small business taxpayers to provide for their retirement by re-investing in their own business. These changes to the capital gains tax are administratively simple and do not lead to costly and complicated compliance burdens on small business taxpayers. However, the proposals for capital gains tax reform outlined in Fightback are complex, administratively unwieldy and certainly unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure introduced in the One Nation economic statement to assist small business is that smaller companies will be given a deferral of their initial tax instalment for the 1991-92 income year. As a result of the economic statement, incorporated businesses with a notional or estimated tax liability of less than $400,000 will be allowed to defer their initial 85 per cent company tax payment for nine weeks. Smaller companies which are due to make an initial company tax payment for the 1991-92 income year after February 1992, will be able to defer that payment until the twenty-eighth day of the third month following the balancing month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has recognised that changes such as this are necessary to small business as the recession has unfortunately resulted in delays in the receipt of income by small businesses, which has thereby reduced cash flow. The deferral of company tax payments by small business will ease the burden for these enterprises in so far as they will not have to pay tax on income which they may not have even received yet, thereby reducing the pressure and uncertainty of having to estimate company tax liabilities within 28 days of the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new debt restructuring arrangements outlined in One Nation mean that taxpayers who are entitled to tax deductions for bad debts which have been written off can claim losses resulting from debt for equity swaps.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic statement has also introduced pooled development funds, PDFs, which are primarily for the expansion of existing firms rather than for new operations and will greatly improve the availability of capital for small and medium sized firms with total assets of less than $30m. The pooled development funds will provide a tax incentive for equity investment in Australian businesses, resulting in companies with good prospects finding it easier to get the patient capital they need. The profits of the pooled development funds will be taxed at the concessional rate of 30 per cent. Dividends from the funds will be tax exempt, as will capital gains tax on the sale of PDF shares. PDFs will not be able to invest in retailing operations or real estate other than tourism projects and industrial buildings used in a manufacturing project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's aim in forming pooled development funds is to provide long term equity capital to small and medium enterprises. Eligible equity interest will be restricted to new capital, primarily for established companies which are expanding production capacity or markets. Some funds will be made available for start-up ventures. The PDFs should fill a market gap which has existed since the Government wound down the management and investment companies scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue recognised as important by the parliamentary committee looking into small business was export development for small and medium sized enterprises, which is a high priority among industry and small business associations. In acknowledging this fact, the Keating Government has increased funding for the export access program. Export access was an initiative of the 1991 Budget, and One Nation announced an increase in its funding from $4m to $12m over three years to assist small and medium businesses to enter export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export access provides participants with a comprehensive package of training and practical assistance in developing successful export activities, including assistance with preparing an export plan, identifying potential overseas buyers and preparing and undertaking an overseas market visit. The program, which targets smaller firms that do not yet have sufficient in-house expertise and resources to maintain their own sustained export development program, has revealed a widespread latent demand among small businesses to diversify their markets by entering export markets. Applications for participation in the program have far exceeded the available places in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased funding announced in the One Nation statement will allow an increase in the number of participants from about 250 to approximately 700 over the life of the program, which will help cater to the added interest. The funding will also go towards improving access to the program by businesses in all States and regions of Australia and enabling additional markets, especially in Asia, to be targeted. The export access program has created an Australian business office in St Louis in the United States. This Government is looking at establishing another office in Europe later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade operations were expanded through the economic statement with a $5m injection to expand its overseas posts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the superannuation guarantee levy announced in the economic statement have also been welcomed by the small business sector. The superannuation guarantee levy represents a major step forward in the development of retirement incomes policy and will lay the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for future generations of retirees. The levy will achieve this by providing a major extension of superannuation coverage, an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply with their award obligations, and an orderly mechanism by which employer superannuation support can be increased over time, consistent with the economy's capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was announced in the economic statement that the Government has decided to alter the implementation schedule of the superannuation guarantee levy to ease the transition costs for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. For these businesses there will be no increase beyond the initial prescribed minimum until 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the least publicised initiatives for small business in One Nation, but by far one of the most important, is the establishment of the Australian Technology Group. The ATG has been established with a view to helping identify research with commercial potential&mdash;particularly from public research bodies, but not limited to the public sector; securing effective control and protection of intellectual property for itself and its partner; providing market research output to Australasian and overseas companies; and further developing an export industry in intellectual property. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">General reaction to the initiatives for small business that are contained in One Nation has been very positive, both from the small business sector and its associations and the media.

Appropriation Bill (No. 5) seeks funding for, firstly, labour market program assistance to job seekers in industry amounting to $87m; secondly, residential care for older people amounting to $50m; and, finally, child-care fee relief amounting to $66m. In respect of these particular provisions, others have said, and I want to reiterate, that there is something very suspicious about them. The Government actually proposes to withdraw sections of existing additional Appropriation Bills and replace them with a new Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Bruce said, it boils down to the fact that the Government has run out of money. I think that is disgraceful.

I think we have had the answer to that posed here already tonight: the Government has run out of money. I would like to hear that from the Government. I do not know whether the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, will answer some of those questions. I suspect he does not know the answers, either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Government not know about this funding crisis at the time of introducing the additional Appropriation Bills only four weeks ago? If it did, why did it not raise it then? That was the time to bring this predicament before the Parliament and the people of Australia. It was not done then and we want to know why. Is this proposed action necessary because the normal channel for funds, the Advance to the Minister for Finance, is being or has been used up for other purposes? I believe the Government needs to reveal to the Parliament and to the people of Australia the funding state of the AMF and to explain why this is not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth question that I think needs to be answered clearly and conclusively is: how can the Government have $317m for a Wills by-election family allowance bribe but not have the ongoing funds for child-care, the aged and the unemployed? Incidentally, my colleague in the Senate the shadow Minister for finance, Senator Short, has posed these questions and has not yet received satisfactory answers to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we see this for what it is: an appalling, transparent, cheap trick to fund handouts for families immediately before the Wills by-election. In discussing this particular proposal in the debate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I asked why these particular payments were so broadly targeted. In other words, there are benefits from these handouts for families on taxable incomes up to $75,000. In that respect they were very poorly targeted indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Appropriation Bill (No. 5), the Opposition believes that the Government action reeks of financial and budgetary mismanagement of the highest order. The Government is going to find itself in increasing difficulties in regard to its budgetary situation as time goes by. In our view the Government's budgetary situation is currently in a shambles. There will be a turnaround in the Budget balance between the first and second halves of 1991-92 of around $15 billion. In other words, we are going to see a move from a budget prediction to an actual budget outcome with a $15 billion difference between the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about things that are unprecedented, I think it would be very difficult for anyone who has been in this place for a long time to point to such a turnaround. It is a turnaround of mammoth proportions. Our criticism of the One Nation statement was that it was unfunded. We are seeing evidence of that tonight with the Government, in a sense, admitting that it has run out of money and needs a further allocation of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) does deal with the funding for some important programs. I would like to  home in on one or two aspects of the Bill dealing with child-care. Child-care is of increasing concern to parents in these difficult times when many families are facing the prospect of having both partners working to make ends meet. This is happening in the community as a result of this Government's economic mismanagement. Many families are having to make a very difficult decision in respect of their children in that both mum and dad have to go out to work in order just to make ends meet. That is not necessarily to finance the purchase of luxuries, but just to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly in the family unit as the fundamental social unit in our society, and I have no doubt that the most ideal form of child-care is care in the home, ideally by one of the parents. Unfortunately, economic circumstances have placed this particular best option out of the reach of many families. I think that is very sad. The social consequences of that are enormous and, in many respects, unmeasurable. The Government will have to accept a good deal of responsibility for the social costs that we will have to pick up down the line as a result of its economic policies which have placed that best option for child-care&mdash;care in the home&mdash;out of the reach of many families. However, access to affordable child-care is essential for working parents. Taking a purely practical approach to it, we accept that that is the situation, and therefore the issue of affordable child-care needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Fightback package, which deals with this particular subject in some detail, we are giving serious consideration to the suggestion that tax rebates should be given on child-care expenditure. In fact, a paper that has been put forward by the Taxation Institute very pointedly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to recognise taxpayers childcare costs as a legitimate income earning expense is among the most striking anomalies in Australia's tax legislation. It impedes the drive for greater national productivity, has significant social as well as economic consequences and is out of step with several of our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. I am very pleased that in the Fightback package we have acknowledged that particular aspect of child-care. We say in the Fightback package that we are going to closely investigate the possibility of picking up that particular recommendation: that  there  should  be  some recognition through the tax system of the cost of child-care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made quite clearly in this particular paper, which is headed `Baby It's Cold Outside', that child-care is an essential expense for sole parents and others who have to work. In that sense, in pure taxation terms, it is an expense that they have to incur for the sake of gaining their income. I believe that those people who are in that situation are discriminated against. Speaking from my own personal experience as a parent of young children, I believe politicians find that particular expense very difficult to cope with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own family situation our child-care bill, just for plain babysitting expenses, is often $50 a week. I am quite sure that, if I were not a member of parliament, I would not be incurring that expense. Members of parliament have to attend numerous functions in the community to which they cannot take their children. I am not arguing for that to be a tax deductible expense simply for members of parliament. In the context of the broader approach to tax deductibility, or recognition through rebates of that expense, there are numerous people in the community who would be in exactly the same category. They are people who have to incur that expense for the sake of gaining their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that we have addressed that issue in the Fightback package. I for one, as a member of the coalition, will be pushing very hard in government for us to take that step; that is, recognising child-care as a legitimate expense. The existing situation of non-deductibility for child-care expenses also encourages reliance on unemployment and sole parent benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also addressed the issue of sole parent benefits in the Fightback package. That has been a difficult issue for many of us to contend with. The fact that we have taken the decision that the sole parent benefit ought to be discontinued when the youngest child turns 12 has not been an easy decision. But I firmly believe that it is the right decision. There is much concern in the community about abuses of sole parent pensions. The most important aspect is that we want to encourage people&mdash;we are generally talking about women or mothers here&mdash;to get back into the work force as soon as they can before their skills become obsolete. We have taken the decision in the Fightback package to discontinue that particular allowance when the youngest child turns 12. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government thrives on running misinformation campaigns about every aspect of our package. I want to make it very clear that, in our proposal to discontinue that allowance when the youngest child turns 12 instead of the present 16 years of age, we are not going to just cut it off and leave those mothers with nothing; in fact, we propose that the allowance be replaced with a Job Search allowance and the associated training benefits will be there. So mothers in that situation will be able to go out and look for work and be retrained, if necessary, to enter the work force. At the end of nine months, if they are not successful in gaining work, they will be considered as being eligible for the special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That exposes, once again, the misinformation we hear so often from the Government that we are going to throw people out on the streets and take them off the Job Search allowance at the end of nine months. We do not propose any such thing, despite what we hear time after time from the Prime Minister; we propose to create a special benefit for them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Standing Orders, we can have wide ranging debates on Appropriation Bills. But this present debate is centred well and truly on matters economic.

On the one hand, we have the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to this House of a month ago, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>, against a policy document put down by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) late last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback!</EMPHASIS> As I said, the differences in the approaches of those two documents could not be any greater.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the debate that has gone on in this discussion on the Appropriation Bills has been centred on those two economic plans. Many of those opposite have allowed themselves to be diverted a little. They seem to have a fixation about getting stuck into the Prime Minister for a whole host of reasons, real or imagined. I am amused that they then in turn suggest that it is the Prime Minister who has caused some diversion from matters that are of real importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of those things they feel is diversionary is a discussion that the Prime Minister has engendered about Australia and Australia's independence on the world stage. I reflect upon the words I used in this House in my very first speech when, because of the name of my electorate, Scullin&mdash;named after Prime Minister James Scullin&mdash;I did a little research about his life and his time as Prime Minister. One of the things I found of great interest was the difficulties he had in the 1930s when, as the Australian Prime Minister, he recommended the first Australian Governor-General, Sir Isaac Isaacs. I noted in that first speech that Scullin encountered much opposition from what I referred to as a `patronising British Government'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then went on to say, `Fortunately, things have changed, albeit gradually'. But I am concerned that there are those who still have the view that we should very much believe that matters British are of uppermost importance to us. The message that the Prime Minister has tried to convey&mdash;and I thought he did so with great generosity on the visit of the Queen&mdash;is that, in the 40 years of her reign, Australia has changed and Great Britain has changed: the outlook of both nations and the importance of our various relations have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is accepted in that vein, people should understand the thrust of what the Prime Minister was attempting to get across. I think younger Australians understand the point the Prime Minister was trying to make. They understand that our future dictates not only that we hold on to our traditional historic ties but that we see them in the context of putting Australia through to the twenty-first century; that we understand that, because of our geographic place in the world, we should embark upon ensuring that our trade and our trading partners develop in a wider scope. That is the real message. It should not be seen as a diversion; it should not be seen as remiss. If it flows on to wider debates on republicanism or otherwise, that is all to the good too, but let that not become, as the terminology is now, a first order issue, because a first order issue is quite obviously getting the economy right and getting the many thousands of Australians who are unemployed back into employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let me contrast the way in which the Opposition and the Government go about trying to put in place the policies to achieve those goals. We have a Prime Minister who unashamedly embarked upon a series of consultations in the run-up to his One Nation statement. We have a Leader of the Opposition who developed a policy statement quite clearly in the abstract of academia. It was done in parts. Not all of the coalition members were involved in its development. Even shadow Ministers had parts that did not relate to their portfolio hidden from them. They were not there to be able to pull it together as a concrete and cohesive set of policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Prime Minister who is willing to go out and listen, who has a team of Ministers who are willing to go out and listen and to take part in the consultative processes that have been developed throughout the years of the present Federal Labor Government. The One Nation policy addresses what is needed for the Australian economy. The Opposition's Fightback is nothing more than an ideological fetish. One Nation is an approach which is designed to provide a stimulus to get the economy going. The Fightback package offers an excuse for a pernicious tax. There are other areas in which one can contrast the different approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) highlight and contrast the differences in industrial relations policy. As the Prime Minister said in One Nation, modern industry has to be a cooperative process. We cannot have workplaces where people are locked in conflict. It would seem that the approach of those opposite is to take us back to the years of confrontation when we had one Australian set against another. The Government's approach truly requires us to develop as one nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other general areas of policy difference. If we look at the Opposition's approach to training, we can see that it would have a system that involved people going into on-the-job training at 80 per cent of award wages. There are no safeguards, it would appear, for the process of so-called churning; that is, where one participant in such a scheme would go on at the reduced award rate and then, at the end of that period, be replaced by another who qualified for that award rate, resulting in no advantage for the first individual. The present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, quite appropriately described Austrain as `Aus-slave'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measures announced in One Nation and their effect on local communities can be seen as significant. Not only were the moneys allocated for infrastructure there to give a kick-start to the economy; they were also well worthwhile projects in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the contribution of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) in his discussion about national railways quite intriguing and disappointing. It was lacking in vision as to what might be possible by bringing together the nation's railways systems under the one umbrella, and he started to attack such efficiencies when, to use his most unfortunate terminology, he equated railways with sheltered workshops. It is a most disappointing description and far from the mark. If we look at providing that type of infrastructure to rail, it will be of great value not only in economic terms but also, ultimately, in environmental terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional road funding that was announced in the One Nation economic plan also has the dual purpose of bringing economic benefit and environmental benefit. In the general area on the urban fringe of Melbourne which I represent, the accelerated funding for the western ring road is important. The funding that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has found for the western road extension between Greensborough bypass and Plenty Road is very important, not only because of the jobs that it will provide and the economical access that it will provide for the people living in those areas, but also, of course, because it will improve the quality of life of those who live on road systems that were not designed to take the volume of traffic that they now carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the interesting things about the Australian political scene at the moment is how a by-election in one Federal seat can so dominate what might occur. Suddenly, many of those who sit opposite have reached for their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melways</EMPHASIS> and found that the electorate of Wills is on about maps 16 to 18 and 28 to 30. They have discovered groups that operate within the Wills electorate and wish to champion their cause in this place at this time.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that quite outrageous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the electorate of Wills was in the electorate of Scullin between 1986 and 1989; therefore, I think I can speak with some knowledge about the types of areas which are within the Wills electorate. The suburbs of Fawkner and Hadfield, which I represented for those three years, are very much akin to a large area of my electorate. I think that like the people of Scullin, the people of Wills know that it is only the Labor Party which they can look to in hard times. There is no denying that they have been hard hit during the recession. Unemployment is high. The people of electorates such as Wills and Scullin have high expectations of Labor governments. They also know that Labor is the only party which has ever served their interests. They know that it has been Labor governments which have provided services and community facilities in electorates such as Wills and Scullin after decades of neglect from the coalition. </PARA>

As every day goes by the people of electorates such as Wills and the wider community know the difference between what is offered under the One Nation policy and what is offered in the Fightback tax slug.

This package will assist 7,000 young people through a combination of measures: a living allowance paid to unemployed apprentices and trainees to assist them in completing their basic training at TAFE; funds to private training providers to run intensive training courses for unemployed apprentices to enable the early completion of their trade training; a subsidy of $100 a week for up to 16 weeks to employers of third- and fourth-year apprentices vulnerable to retrenchment, to enable apprentices to complete trade training; an increased incentive from $500 to $1,000 to encourage employers to recruit unemployed apprentices; and an incentive of $300 to hire unemployed trainees. These are concrete measures which will have positive impacts in electorates such as Wills and Scullin as well as in other areas. </PARA>

On top of massive punitive cuts to the fabric of the social welfare system contemplated by the coalition, the average men and women of Australia are to be subjected to a considerable rise in the price of the basic necessities of life. For the people in Wills the Leader of the Opposition is offering a policy that, on best estimates, would see the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables rise by 10.1 per cent, clothing by 11.2 per cent, electricity by 10 per cent and health services by 22 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. The electorate of Wills is more than well known to the parties on this side of the House. I suggest that honourable members opposite might find out what it is all about in Wills and what, in fact, the great bulk of the Australian population has been complaining about for nigh on these last two years. The policies of this Government, which were largely the policies of this new Prime Minister, have led us to the mother of all recessions and brought us to the point of having to bring down an intermediate economic statement in March; following an intermediate economic statement in November, following a Budget in August&mdash;all of which are still subject to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable member for Scullin that economic circumstances in this country have changed over the last 12 months to an extent much greater than in any period in the past or in the foreseeable future. Last financial year we budgeted for an $8 billion surplus. This financial year we are likely to wind up with an $8 billion deficit, and on top of that we have an unfunded package, which we are discussing tonight by way of these machinery Bills, contained in a pork-barrelled statement called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS>. So we may well wind up with an economic position of reversal approaching some $16 billion, or perhaps $18 billion, in 12 months. I venture to say that had we made any economic proposal to reverse public sector spending in Australia by some $18 billion, the cry from the other side would have been heard around the world&mdash;perhaps even on the moon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included within the One Nation statement and these funding packages is provision for TAFE. TAFE is the flavour of the moment&mdash;somewhat, I would remark, past time. Provision for extra funding for TAFE includes Austudy, which makes it appropriate that we discuss the package of student financial assistance, called Austudy, and that we discuss modern provision for TAFE&mdash;or technical and further education&mdash;in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation package purports to add some $720m over the 1993-1995 triennium to previously committed funding. But there is a bit of a pea and thimble trick here&mdash;not that I would accuse the Prime Minister of deception; far be it from me to make such a statement. In fact, the $720m is minus some $300m in previously committed funding. So One Nation adds not $720m, but $420m to TAFE spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Prime Minister and if those honourable members on the Government side of the House care to read properly the Fightback statement, they will find a commitment to training that is unparalleled in the history of Australia. The con job in this statement that keeps respending the extra commitment over and over again must surely come to an end eventually . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this then brings us to the question of Austudy. I note that it is of some national significance that on the television tonight we saw students protesting and we saw blood in the streets for the first time in many years. It seems a bit senseless for students to protest over proposed Austudy changes because the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) has in fact denied any responsibility for, or connection or association with, a preliminary report put out by his consultant, Professor Bruce Chapman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve months ago the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a report on student financial assistance. We made a great heap of recommendations which were well thought out and bipartisan in nature. As a consequence of that report, the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who is now our Treasurer (Mr Dawkins)&mdash;I believe the fourth one we have had in a year&mdash;decided that the Department of Employment, Education and Training was not capable of responding to our report and so he directed the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services to hire an outside consultant, Dr Bruce Chapman, to bring down another report on Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman, rightly or wrongly, brought before the Minister a preliminary report for discussion-only purposes. As a result of that preliminary report for discussion we have seen student protests the likes of which we have not seen since the Vietnam war. It seems a bit senseless to me to argue about a preliminary report which is not final; particularly since the Minister in question has told Dr Chapman&mdash;his consultant who is paid for by our taxpayers' funds&mdash;to change his report. Before Dr Chapman had even brought down his report, the Minister said, `I don't like your result; I don't like any of your potential recommendations. Change it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Dr Chapman is in the process of rewriting the report which he will present in final form. I think probably, if one were to ask him, Dr Chapman would be willing to admit privately that he is not very happy about having been told by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services how to write his report. I am certain he is not very happy about students protesting in the streets; but then perhaps the students have not really listened to what Dr Chapman is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is a massive program to deliver grants to students at a secondary and tertiary level in order to provide them with living expense assistance so that the most financially disadvantaged in our nation can achieve educational equity. The problem with the grants scheme is that it becomes very difficult to design a simple system so that we can simply target those who are most in need and those who might not otherwise either finish their secondary education or achieve a tertiary education without financial assistance. So we have Austudy, which followed on from TEAS, which followed on from scholarships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is full of inequities. The greatest inequity of the lot, I suppose, is the fact that the Government and the Minister have never really spelled out clear policy objectives for the scheme. Very recently the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services responded to our report on Austudy. It took him some nine months but this month he finally responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our very first recommendation was that the Government and the Minister develop clear policy objectives for Austudy, for student financial assistance grants schemes. The Minister, who clearly is listening to departmental advice, has responded to us that the objectives are already published and are clear. This was a bipartisan Committee, which said that the objectives are not clear and that no-one understands what the heck the scheme is supposed to do. The policy objective is simply stated as breaking down financial barriers. That is pretty vague, is it not? It can mean almost anything. Our Committee asked for a much clearer definition of the objectives, such as to provide a comprehensive living allowance or to provide support in addition to other income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, Austudy is not designed to provide 100 per cent of living expenses for secondary and tertiary students because, if it is, I can tell the House they will starve. The maximum Austudy payment is of the order of $4,000 and the NUS, rightly or wrongly, reckons that about $12,000 per year is needed to maintain a student. That covers board, lodging, transport, books and incidentals, and does not include HECS. Maybe it is only $10,000&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but certainly one cannot live on $4,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy is a supplementary scheme to provide money to assist those who are most financially disadvantaged. Unfortunately, instead of targeting those in most financial need, it is broad-based and services some 43 per cent of tertiary students. I suspect, because that is old data, that this year, with the recession, when students are staying on at university, that figure will be up to 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second recommendation was to develop performance indicators against the objectives which the Department has not set and the Minister does not support so that we can see whether we are getting the money to the students who need it. That seems very reasonable. The Minister says that DEET, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, does monitor some small indicators and it thinks we are doing just fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anecdotal evidence I get when I travel around the country and discuss Austudy with parents and students in the outback, in country regions and in cities all over the country is that it is one of the most rorted systems of financial assistance of all times. I am told that in Western Australia Alan Bond's daughter got Austudy. I hear story after story of well-off students arriving in their BMWs and their Mercedes to collect their Austudy cheques. The Department thinks it is doing a good job of monitoring Austudy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest problems with the whole scheme is the fact that it is basically a means test scheme. That means that one is paid Austudy on the basis of financial need. The financial need is the need of one's parents, and until one is 25 one is deemed to be not independent of one's parents in terms of Austudy. We have created a few problems, and probably the most disadvantaged students in Australia today are those who fall into the middle family income situation where momma and poppa earn enough to fall outside the means test limits of Austudy but have decided, for whatever reasons, to donate their money to other priorities. The potential student then receives no parental assistance but cannot receive Austudy because his parents' means are above the minimum limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone who manages to own a company business and to structure his or her income so as to receive a majority or a substantial portion of that income as fringe benefits, or receive some of it in the future in significant superannuation payments, and who dedicates a portion of that income to negative gearing on the property market&mdash;all of which is legitimate for taxation purposes and all of which we have decided is proper and above board&mdash;can structure that income so that he or she pays minimal tax, has a minimal before-tax income. The children of such a person are therefore eligible to receive Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made some very clear recommendations. We said that the Department should review the allowable deductions for taxable income in order to determine whether Austudy should be paid. We said that fringe benefits should be included as income and that superannuation payments, particularly when one is donating lots of money from a company income situation, should be considered as income when considering Austudy payments. The Minister says that it is all too hard; it is not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, brought in the fringe benefits tax he elected to take the easy option and charge companies for fringe benefits which they gave to employees, rather than charging the employees for benefits thus received. So Australia would have to be one of the few countries, if not the only country, in the world that taxes one institution&mdash;that is, a company&mdash;for the benefit of someone else, the employee. Because of that we then pay Austudy to those individuals who get the fringe benefits. It is a ripper of a rort, I must say. But the Minister says it is too hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason students are protesting and that there is blood in the streets today is that Dr Chapman had the audacity to suggest that part of the $1.3 billion per year that we spend on Austudy would be better devoted to providing those students who elected to take up the option with interest free student loans. The students would decide how much they took, and they could pay it back with their HECS through the taxation system when they were in jobs or in income producing situations&mdash;having, I must note, received the benefit of their tertiary education in terms of their income earning capacity. That seemed eminently reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put such a proposition to countless numbers of parents around Australia. I have said, `Look, you give us this problem with Austudy, and a second problem, a third problem, a fourth problem or a fifth problem. I tell you, there are lots of problems because it is impossible to design a grants system and target it effectively without making it so complex that it will never work at all'. As it is, it is pretty complex. The form is terrible, is it not? The form is really horrible. Form 9 for asset testing is even worse. Regardless of how difficult it is now, the more tightly we target it, every door we try to close makes it more complex, and every door we close opens another door for another rort for someone else to receive the grant whom we do want to receive it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Dr Chapman very sensibly proposed that at least a portion of our grants system be dedicated to student loans which would be taken on an individual basis and become an item of student financial assistance that was elected by the students&mdash;not forced on them, but elected by them. What happened?  There is blood in the streets. Do honourable members know why?  Life must be too good for students, or at least those from the NUS who like to protest. The Austudy system must really be good, so good that it provides them with enough income that they are willing to go out and fight a national battle over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the last country in the world to retain a major grants system to financially support students in tertiary education. Beyond that, we are one of the very few, if any, major countries in the world today that provide their secondary students in the last two years of secondary school with student financial assistance to support their living expenses. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the honourable member for La Trobe was a little confused with the terminology, as he kept referring to blood on the streets today. I watched several news bulletins this evening. I saw a couple of vigorous demonstrations which, surely, in a free and democratic society we are entitled to. I did not see very much blood. From memory, I think the most vigorous demonstration was in Brisbane. I saw a couple of scuffles there, but I did not see very much blood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Warming to his subject, the honourable member informed us in a very dramatic tone that we have the greatest riots in the streets since the days of the Vietnam war. Let me say to the honourable member for La Trobe that, in the very unlikely event that the other side of this House wins the next election, he has seen nothing yet. If the honourable member thought that a few students protesting today was a riot, he should see what would happen if the mad swing to the Right&mdash;by the ideologically blinkered Right&mdash;is inflicted on this country. One does not have to take my word for it. One can see what has happened where the Right has had the ascendancy in the last couple of years. One can look at New Zealand, where that Government has tried to implement right wing ideological policies, right wing economic policies and industrial relations policies. Such countries have seen protests as they have never been seen before&mdash;be it in New Zealand, Britain or any of these places. The reason is that the policies attack the living standards of the working men and women of those countries. They will not tolerate that nor will they tolerate the imposition of a 15 per cent tax on everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that the honourable member for La Trobe has left the chamber. It is a pity because I particularly wanted him to hear this. I admit, as would anyone in an electorate office, that I hear stories of abuse of welfare systems and of Austudy. There are difficulties with Austudy; I am the first to admit that. I think we have to take a serious look at it; indeed, a committee has looked at it. I sometimes get a bit tired, though, when I hear about students driving up in a BMW or a Mercedes Benz to collect their Austudy cheques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this to the honourable member in all seriousness because undoubtedly, like me, people come to his office and tell him about rorts that they believe are in the welfare system. I always ask those people who are making these accusations to give me the evidence. I tell them that if they give me the evidence I will follow it through. It might be single mothers on the supporting parent benefit; it might be a whole range of things. When I ask for the evidence it is very rarely produced. The response I receive usually goes something like this: `Well, you know, Colin. My sister lives next door to someone who knows someone who is rorting the system'. That is the evidence that is given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not naive enough to suggest that there is no rorting of the system at all out there; of course there is. I think the honourable member for La Trobe summed it up when he said that, if we were going to stop all rorting, we would almost have to have a police state. But people throw these accusations around about people driving up in a BMW or a Mercedes Benz to collect their Austudy cheques and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member should not come into this Parliament and make these claims unless he has seen this happening or people are prepared to give him the evidence that people are driving up in BMWs. It most certainly does not happen in my electorate or the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin), who is at the table. We know everyone who has a Mercedes Benz or a BMW in both of our electorates. Believe me, there are not many of them. They are so well known because they are such a rare commodity in our area and they would not dare to drive up to the office in that way. As I said, if the honourable member for La Trobe thinks that today's minor demonstrations or minor disturbances were the most violent that he has seen since the Vietnam war, if Australia is unfortunate to have that side of the House inflicted on it after the next Federal election, he has seen nothing yet&mdash;believe you me!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly support the One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I strongly support it for the commitments that the Prime Minister has given to Australia's transport system. One of the greatest challenges&mdash;if not the greatest challenge&mdash;facing our country is to have an effective and efficient transport system. The efficiency and effectiveness of the transport sector is critically important to the Australian economy. I suggest that it is an inescapable consequence of our nation's size and dispersed population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally desirable is the need to develop a more equitable society by increasing our national income. The Commonwealth's guiding objective is to promote and develop an integrated, efficient and coordinated land transport system that reflects the national, economic and social priorities, that pursues safe and effective practices responsive to user requirements with each mode undertaking the transport task to which it is most suited, and which is equipped to meet the rapid growth envisaged in the 1990s and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The means of achieving these essential goals is by structural adjustment through micro-economic reform. Micro-economic reform aims to accelerate growth in living standards. It also seeks to establish an environment in which industry can provide the goods and services demanded by Australians and by our trading partners at competitive prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, this Government's reform achievements span the whole economy, including product and labour markets, service industries, the waterfront&mdash;despite what people on the other side might say&mdash;aviation and, indeed, broadcasting. The task in the transport sector is to improve intermodal choice and the links between modes to lower the real cost of transport. That is something that we in this Parliament should all be committed to. This directly benefits industries, exporters and consumers. More efficient railways, for instance, would substantially decrease the annual $4 billion drain by the railways on public sector savings and assist some of Australia's largest exporters. Improved efficiency in road investment and management can increase the returns to the community from the Commonwealth's considerable road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has also played a pivotal role in initiating road reforms that can deliver an extra $2m a year in national earnings. Working with the States and Territories, the Government has embarked on a reform strategy that aims to develop a more efficient and responsive national transport sector. The basis of this program is the Government's fourth-term policy commitment to structural reform of those industries with the greatest impact on the national economy. The impetus is the very real need for Australia to be more competitive internationally. The specific aim is to increase the economy's responsiveness and resilience by enabling higher growth in productivity, production and employment, and real wages, and easing Australia's susceptibility to changes in demand and fluctuating world commodity prices that can destabilise our balance of payments outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has estimated that land transport reform has a capacity to increase our national income by more than $6 billion. The Federal Government is determined to deliver these benefits to the economy and to all Australians. The changes now under way are being pursued in a spirit of cooperation with other levels of government through the establishment of institutions covering the national transport sector. However, more change is needed and at a faster pace. This is not solely a government responsibility, but one which we must all share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industries and those sectors serving them need to be more efficient; that is, increasing the return on public funds through better management practices, more targeted investment, lifting productivity and the use of new technology. The efficiencies achieved can be passed directly to users in the form of lower prices. While increasing efficiency and improving performance in the transport sector, the Government will act to safeguard public interests, social justice and safety objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pursuit of a modern, efficient and cost-effective transport system across all modes has required the creation of new institutional structures in both road and rail, national in outlook and commercially focused. As a consequence, governments are moving towards a consistent national, institutional and regulatory environment conducive to structural reform and growth. More transparent cost structures will provide clearer price signals in the marketplace. It follows that goods and services will be valued appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savings flowing from these changes will contribute to a more equitable society through improved national income. Underpinning this restructuring of the industry is a forward looking infrastructure development program, the largest of its type ever undertaken by any government in recent years. The Federal Government and the National Rail Corporation have committed $2.2 billion to mainline rail development in the years ahead. This Government will spend $4 billion on Australia's national road networks in the three financial years to June 1994. This Government's land transport strategy and the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister focuses Commonwealth spending on road and rail projects that reduce transport costs for industries, speed the flow of goods and produce to ports or demonstrate a capacity to lift national income through shorter travelling time and greater efficiency gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My only disappointment with the Prime Minister's statement relates to two projects which I and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who is sitting at the table, are committed to: the Caloola Pass Road and the Maldon-Dombarton rail link to the port of Port Kembla, so that it can reach its full potential as an export development port. Neither of us nor the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) had given up in our pursuit to have that objective achieved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the comments made by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), may I in my opening remarks simply put in a word or two in defence of freedom of choice in education and say that I do not believe that even the honourable member for Throsby believes that the evidence of one letter from one constituent damns all education systems, whether they be private or public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate I have some very good private schools and some very good public schools. I discover that there is a certain enthusiasm for the private schools, which I am quite prepared to endorse, given that I do not find the students in the private schools placing the same demands on the taxpayers' dollar as the students in the public schools do. In that sense, I think we need to applaud freedom in education and freedom of choice in education. Even the honourable member for Throsby would agree that the evidence he has put to the Parliament tonight in criticism of the private school system was hardly representative of the entire system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose to participate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92. As speakers before me have evidenced, this Bill seeks the funding of $87m for labour market reform and for assistance to job seekers in industry, $50m for residential fee relief for older people and $66m for child-care relief. This Bill is necessary because the Government considers that these three items of expenditure are so important that they cannot wait on the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1991-92 through the Parliament. The Government has indicated that awaiting the passage of that Bill would place severe hardship on many individuals, companies and charitable organisations, principally, the Opposition has observed, in the electorate of Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that the Opposition has with these Bills is what this passage of money does to the Government deficit. As we are all aware, the Government indicated in the 1991-92 Budget that it was anticipating a $4.7 billion deficit. It was not long before that particular prediction was revised to suggest there would be a $6.3 billion deficit. But now, as a result of the impact of the One Nation package on government funding, we find that that deficit has blown out to $6.8 billion.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government has indicated that by 1992-93 the deficit will hopefully&mdash;and I underscore `hopefully'&mdash;be $8 billion. It is this blow-out in deficit that most clearly marks the difference between the Government's One Nation package and the Opposition's Fightback package. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, what we have with the One Nation package is distinctly a credit card led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular significance of the GST, the proposal for tax reform under the Opposition Fightback package, is that the GST is not an additional tax. In fact, seven existing taxes go. The Liberal and National parties have mutually pledged themselves to a reduction of $13 billion in public sector spending. At this point we see most clearly marked the difference between the Government's proposals and the Opposition's proposals. What we are putting to the people of Australia is not an additional tax but one tax that replaces seven existing taxes and one tax that deliberately and significantly takes less of the taxpayers' revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts that we cannot escape, much as we would like to, are the facts about the Government debt. I want to refer to two charts. The first is an indication of Australia's net external debt. The chart starts in 1960 and runs through to 1990. It is painfully evident that in 1983 the Government's external debt soared out of control, reaching, on a calculation made a fortnight ago, $163 billion, compared with $35 billion when the Government came into office. This level of debt can only be repaid by additional Australian productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to score a cheap political point by suggesting that this debt is the fault of the former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not entirely. Part of this debt is the fault of misguided entrepreneurs around Australia&mdash;something that the Opposition freely acknowledges. But the Prime Minister cannot wash his hands of this debt, because he, along with the entrepreneurs, has been very much a part of that graph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant, inescapable and damnably uncomfortable truth is that that debt can only be repaid by increasing Australia's export earnings. This is clearly a part of the Opposition's Fightback package. It has been calculated that, unless we raise our export performance by an improved 3.5 per cent of our GDP and sustain it, we cannot pay off that debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second chart to which I draw the attention of the House is a measure of our export performance relative to GDP since 1970 through to 1990. At the top of that chart one will note that there is a line. That line is the 3.5 per cent improvement in GDP, export related, that we need to pay off the debt. In 20 years we have not done it. These two charts underscore all that the Opposition is about in offering an alternative to the One Nation package. They underscore what is wrong with the One Nation package, because we would contend that one cannot justify a credit card led recovery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; I appreciate the courtesy. If we are serious about repaying Australia's debt, we have no choice but to improve our export performance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians should be asking themselves, as I am sure every Government member has asked himself or herself: why on earth would an Opposition be proposing such a dramatic change?  Why should we run around committing ourselves to something that is going to be initially unpopular, unless there is no choice?  If we are truly to be an alternative government, if we are to stand and look the electors in the eye and say, `This is where we are going and why', we find ourselves with no choice but to outline what are dramatic changes in order to deliberately encourage Australians to be productive and to reward them for doing so by taking away the penalty that currently exists through our income tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the debate in this House on tariff reform the Prime Minister was very anxious to denigrate the Opposition. As has been clearly pointed out by the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), there is little between the Opposition's proposals for tariff reform and the Government's proposals for tariff reform, except that the Opposition commits itself unreservedly to industrial relations and micro-economic reform hand-in-glove with tariff reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that the Prime Minister, given that it is much easier for the Opposition to oppose than to agree with the Government, would at least have been gracious enough to acknowledge that what he has sought to achieve in tariff reform has not been thwarted by the Opposition parties. But, no, what did we have? We had the bare-faced hypocrisy of a Prime Minister who wanted to pretend that what we were doing was totally different from what he was doing, even though what we had done was done with a great deal of Opposition discomfort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time the Prime Minister woke up to the simple fact that the Opposition has endeavoured, not only in the area of tariff reform but also in the area of taxation reform, to be responsible, accountable and answerable to the people of Australia, and has not chosen to make cheap political points out of any one of the major reforms that will be necessary if we as Australians are to accept the challenge we face in paying off the debt that has been incurred over the past eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of the Opposition's Fightback package, particularly the proposed changes to taxation, I frequently find myself as the representative of a rural electorate facing all sorts of accusations from the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). The honourable member for Hinkler has come into this House and said on frequent occasions that every primary producer will find that the cost of the primary products he or she is producing will go up by 15 per cent. I was delighted this evening to note that the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) reviewed that figure. Whereas the honourable member for Hinkler alleged there would be a 15 per cent increase, the honourable member for Scullin was at least prepared to review that figure downwards somewhat&mdash;you may have heard him make this comment, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and suggest that the increase would be 10.5 per cent. I say to the House that the proposal under the Opposition's GST package is to advantage&mdash;not to disadvantage&mdash;rural producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been all too easy to get the impression that ALP members have somehow been pleased and almost relieved to be able to say that rural producers around Australia, because of their low income, pay little income tax and therefore will not be advantaged by the Opposition's goods and services tax. As a member of the alternative government, and as a representative of a rural electorate, my commitment is to make sure that my farmers pay income tax, not by increasing their income tax rates but by increasing to realistic levels of return they get on their investments, so that along with the rest of Australians they become income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But my message in tonight's debate is this: even my farmers who are currently poverty stricken and not paying income tax will be advantaged by the GST. The GST is attractive to people who are paying income tax because of the changes it offers in tax rates&mdash;16c in the dollar if they are earning less than $22,000; 30c in the dollar if they are earning less than $50,000. Even people not on large incomes will be advantaged by this package. Why? Because seven existing taxes are rubbed out. I do not have time tonight to elaborate, but let me deal with just three of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition proposes to remove in total, under its GST package, the wholesale sales tax. Out goes wholesale sales tax. What does that do? It removes a tax that is totally inconsistent in the way in which it applies. Do people realise that they pay wholesale sales tax on toothpaste but not on toothbrushes, that they pay wholesale sales tax on wardrobes but not if they are built in, that they pay wholesale sales tax on above-ground swimming pools but not on in-ground pools? A whole measure of inconsistencies is removed when wholesale sales tax is taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many farmers are currently in industries that are not entirely exempt from wholesale sales tax but at least have relief from it, all of the people who service the rural areas of Australia, for example, the truckies who bring the goods into rural towns and take the goods out, will find that their trucking rigs and spare parts have the wholesale sales tax removed. Their tyres and fan belts will all be cheaper as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the wholesale sales tax that is removed will be replaced by a goods and services tax, but under the Opposition's proposal that goods and services tax will be rebated because it is a cost to business. Effectively, the wholesale sales tax will be removed and there will be no tax to replace it. There will be a real fall in the cost of servicing rural industries and getting rural produce to the ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if that were not enough&mdash;and one can see the attraction that offers to rural people&mdash;in addition, diesel fuel, used principally in trucks, will have the petroleum excise removed so that it is available to the truckie at the same rate as it is currently available to the farmer for use on farm. Of course, it will be replaced by a GST but, as the fuel is a legitimate business cost, the GST will be rebated. The diesel fuel and the petrol, for that matter, that is used in the rural communities and in any form of business enterprise will fall in price. Even in those areas where people do not have the GST rebated, the price of the fuel will nonetheless fall. So the first question people on fixed incomes who are concerned about the impact of the GST should ask themselves is: `Do I own a car?'. If they do, they will be advantaged by $10 or $11 every time they pull up at the bowser to fill their tanks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the third tax area of change in the Fightback package compared with the One Nation package is that the Opposition proposes to remove payroll tax. It is too easy to be flippant about payroll tax and say, `Oh well, small business isn't affected by payroll tax'. Of course it is. In New South Wales alone, 54 per cent of employees are employed in industries that pay payroll tax, and the cost of that to those industries flows on to every other New South Wales consumer. A similar situation exists in every State in Australia. If we remove payroll tax we remove a real disincentive to employment. The Opposition proposes to provide opportunities for employment, as part of its Fightback package, by removing the current payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As if this were not enough&mdash;and time will not permit me to run through all of the advantages in the Fightback package&mdash;the Opposition goes one step further by exempting exports so that all Australian manufacturers, particularly primary producers, involved in producing exports will be producing goods that are more economic to export and more attractive in terms of the revenue they raise for Australia. In terms of the graphs that I had incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, there is a real opportunity to push that line through the 3.5 per cent and help us meet the debt that has been mutually incurred by the Government and by entrepreneurs. The removal of payroll tax will do something to encourage employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was appalled tonight to hear the honourable member for Scullin say that only the Labor Government has ever done anything for the poor and the underprivileged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 5), Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) largely because of an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Furrowed brows down on the farm' by rural writer Tim Stevens. This article highlights to me one of the real quandaries we have as a nation and as a parliament in trying to identify where we go from here. As a parliamentarian, it concerns me that the politics of prejudice and personality are increasingly dominating the debate at a time when the people of Wills and the people of Australia deserve better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Tim Stevens's article and its implications, like the measures in this Bill, are not going to provide a solution for those poor and underprivileged to which the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) referred. It seems to me that all the Government has done for the poor and underprivileged is create more of them. I do not think that is anything of which a government or a Labor Party should be proud. As one of my colleagues said a moment ago, there are one million people unemployed. Is that really something Government members would want to have blazoned around the electorate of Wills and around Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a measure which itself is illustrative of the whole problem. I have researched this legislation and I believe this is the first time that Appropriation Bills being advanced in their normal course through the Senate will be altered before they have been passed through. According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), they are being altered because of a requirement to meet expenditure which in a time frame on current estimates cannot be accommodated by the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Why not? The Advance to the Minister for Finance on every past occasion has been adequate for circumstances of additional expenditure by the Government. This is not late in the parliamentary year&mdash;this is towards the end of March&mdash;and the Parliament is going to sit for some months before the end of the current financial year. Sure, things are crook, but we have been told that things are now bottoming out. We have had all this rhetoric about progress and recovery, which I am afraid I am not as yet convinced has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is going to alter the financial allocations, which will put more pressure on borrowing by those who are going to enable the economy to recover and generate the jobs&mdash;which I happen to be worried about. This legislation is going to put greater pressure on our deficit. The turnaround has been well and truly articulated by my colleagues who have spoken before me. This legislation will ensure that money is not going to be cheaper and recovery is going to be slower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come back to the article I mentioned and then look at the One Nation document and at where we are going. As a representative of rural Australia, I do not believe the crisis is just a product of drought, nor of a fall in commodity prices. I believe the crisis in rural Australia is Government made. In my mind, the measures that were pursued by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), the five-minute Treasurer and former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, have been absolutely disastrous for those I represent. It is appalling that somebody who supposedly has some background in agriculture pursued policies that reached the state that Tim Stevens addresses in his article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without significant stimuli&mdash;not just rain&mdash;the rural sector may never turn around to a situation where it can again be described as healthy.</PARA>
<PARA>That legacy of the honourable member for Werriwa as Minister for Primary Industries is diabolical for the Australian family farmer. It is no use saying that we are in the day of corporate agriculture and vertical integration and that the day of the individual who tilled his block of earth, milked his cows, dug his vegetables and laid out his dried vine fruits has gone. His day has not gone. That is the basis of the arithmetic of modern civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a moment I will refer to an excellent analysis by Ian Castles in the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication headed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural Australia</EMPHASIS>. I want to talk about some of the figures included in it. I have a complaint about this paper: it refers to the 1986 census. I say to Mr Castles that I hope that we will get the product of the analysis of the most recent census a little before six years after the event. Mr Castles and his staff have a capacity with their computers to give us some updating of these demographic characteristics and the economic statistics of what is happening in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper has only just been produced so, although I am referring to a 1986 census, it is the latest information available. There were 2.3 million people counted in rural areas, which represented 15 per cent of all people counted in Australia. As far as I am concerned, that 15 per cent of people is just as important as anybody else in this country. The present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is a joke, and there is no use addressing the contribution he has made. One Nation reflects that his contribution has been nil. The package did provide a bit of money for counsellors&mdash;and I am pleased to see that&mdash;and there are some adjustments in the contribution for rural adjustment, but there is no amendment to rural adjustment. Rural adjustment is still helping people off the land. The original rural adjustment scheme, the original income equalisation deposit scheme, was designed to help to keep people on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this Government and each of its successive Ministers for primary industries have achieved has been to force people off the land. That is why Mr Stevens's catastrophic statement that `the rural sector may never turn around to a situation where it can again be described as healthy' is the epitaph on the term of the honourable member for Werriwa as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will look first at Mr Stevens's article, then go to the general climate of the rural sector and come back to what One Nation does for it. I do not have long to do it, but I want to do it because it seems to me that there are some fallacies around the country at the moment. To my mind, Mr Stevens's article is based on entirely the wrong premise. This country has enormous resources in the rural sector&mdash;human and material. This is still one of the most efficient food producing countries in the world. If there is to be a crisis in the world, it will be a shortage of food&mdash;a shortage of the very things of which Australia is the most efficient producer in the world. We have to place emphasis again on the way in which we can allow that sector not only to play its part but to drag Australia out of this enormous debt burden that Labor has imposed on us&mdash;a burden which the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with his One Nation statement will augment and which he, in his role as Treasurer, created&mdash;that is, a debt-loaded burden that no sensible farmer would be proud to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Mr Stevens say that is so wrong and creates this problem?  First he says that the nation can, in effect, float with a sick rural sector. He seems to have a view that Australia is out of the trough. I will come back to that in a moment. In my view Australia is bubbling along at the bottom of the trough, and I can see no significant sign that it is improving. Let us face it&mdash;in terms of investment in plant and machinery in the secondary sector, Australia today, in 1992, is at its lowest position for 30 years. In terms of our secondary industry we are way down in the depths. It is certainly no better in the rural sector. The second thing Mr Stevens says is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sector's contribution to Australia's gross product has dropped from more than one quarter in the early 1950s to less than 4 per cent in 1990-92.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is that? Because of commodity prices, drought and the debt burden that this Government has created for farmers. There is no longer the wheat stabilisation scheme. We know of the absolutely disastrous way in which the former Minister for Primary Industries handled the wool price support mechanism. It is no use saying, `Oh, but it had had its day'. The point is that the Government was part of making it have its day. There was a representative of the Minister's Department on the Australian Wool Corporation through every phase of decisions which made that 870c limit. He was there through every phase of the decisions that changed the legislation that took away the responsibility to ensure that that minimum reserve price took account of the price of other commodities. Those were the 1987 amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that my colleague the former member for Gwydir, Mr Ralph Hunt, when shadow Minister for primary industries during an early phase of the Hawke Government, produced some figures and calculated seven years ago that the Labor burden on the rural sector at that stage was more than $2 billion per annum. I have tried to update the figures, and on my calculations it is three times as high as that at about $6 billion per year. That is removing tax concessions, removing wheat stabilisation schemes, changing commodity arrangements and removing the minimum reserve price scheme for wool. That additional burden is something like $6 billion per year in the rural sector. It takes account of the higher relative rate of the cost of money in Australia and takes account of the debt burden that this Government's policies, including One Nation, represent. The third thing that Mr Stevens says is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the late 1980s balance of payments crisis was largely created by the blow-out in foreign borrowings by the so-called entrepreneurs and a blow-out in spending, it was compounded by crashing rural commodity prices and the resultant trade deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to understand that that was not purely the result of the commodity crash. It was at a time when trade indices around the world were rising. The opportunities were there, and if the Government had taken the right action, if it had been on the front foot and tried to worry a little more about bilateral trade arrangements&mdash;for example, in the Middle East&mdash;a lot of our problems would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the live sheep trade, we have to understand that through successive Ministers for trade under the Labor Government there was a feeling that they did not like the politics of Saudi Arabia and did their best to antagonise the Saudis. During the most recent visit by the honourable member for Werriwa, in his current role as Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, he did not even see the Minister for agriculture in Saudi Arabia. Why not?  Because of the progressive antagonism that has grown between this administration, under whichever manifestation, and the Government of Saudi Arabia. If this Government had tried to do more in the Middle East and in Asia from the time when it was first elected, that crisis that Mr Stevens referred to would not have been as bad. At that stage world trade was on the rise. Instead of our leading the world into depression, we would have been out there behind the rest of the world. And so we could and should have been. Mr Stevens continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the turnaround can also be attributed to wool prices which have since fallen back again, and drought breaking rains.</PARA>
<PARA>Wool is in a crisis state. The downward spiral continues according to yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and  today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says woolgrowers are on tenterhooks as prices hold steady. There are enormous problems in marketing. The price is compounded because of the difficulties of knowing how to handle the stockpile, and the Government has been absolutely of no use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why we have three organisations, I do not know. The Government seems to go mad on creating jobs in the bureaucracy. We have three bureaucracies to do a job that one could do. I pay great tribute to those who are on the Australian Wool Realisation Commission for the impossible task that they are attempting. The reality is that those in the Wool Realisation Commission should be linked with those in research and development and with those in the Australian Wool Corporation who are responsible for promotion. I believe that between the three they could do the task far better than three organisations could. There needs to be far more sympathetic consideration of the recommendations that were made by Sir William Vines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Government cannot reach a decision, it has great pleasure in appointing committees of inquiry. It has appointed some outstanding Australians to these committees, and Bill Vines is a very good example. I thought he produced a great report. It was a very difficult challenge. The Government had made a mess of it. The Government refused to acknowledge its involvement in the collapse of the minimum reserve price scheme. What happened?  It appointed Bill Vines, he came out with his report, and its most significant recommendations were ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether those recommendations would have created a better wool market. Nobody can tell now, because the time is past. The point I make is that it is of no use appointing people who are experts and have knowledge of the industry, then listening to their reports, and then saying, `No, we don't like them'. That is what the Government did with the wool industry in the first place. It had its own representatives from the Department of Primary Industries on the Wool Corporation right through the period of the wool market collapse. As far as I am concerned, it was the Government that created half the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I wanted to refer briefly to the demographics of the industry. There is no doubt that in the rural sector we have some significant problems. In terms of the present decline, we have a high proportion of children but a low proportion of people in their teens and their early twenties. The cost of education in the rural sector is significantly higher. We have a number of difficulties in the ageing of the population on farms in Australia. We have a greater percentage of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in the rural community. We have a lower percentage of migrants, but a larger group who come from English speaking countries. We have a higher proportion of women, but when we get down to education, employment and income, there lies the rub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People living in rural areas have left school at an earlier age than urban dwellers. Fewer of them have graduate or post-school qualifications. To a large degree rural students are being ignored by this Government. The Government talks about what it does for education. Children in boarding schools are ignored. Children who go to universities, whether to institutions such as the University of New England and its many campuses or Sturt University, have to live away from home. This Government has taken away the assistance to residential colleges. Austudy does not take account of the circumstances where, because of the means test, there are enormous difficulties for many who are on the land in educating their children to the standard that they would wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of tertiary students who live in rural areas is low. I could go on. The analysis of these statistics from ABARE are a damning indictment of the Government and of One Nation. As is said in this report, there is high unemployment. There is high unemployment for a compound of reasons. There is a movement out of the rural sector. It is a major social problem. The point is that One Nation has done absolutely nothing about it. What we have to understand is that the One Nation forecast economic growth for 1992-93 is 4.75 per cent, following zero growth in 1991-92. These year average forecasts imply six to seven quarters of strong economic growth. Although perhaps not quite as strong as the recovery from the 1982 recession, they certainly project a medium term forecast growth of around 4.5 per cent for the next three years with inflation remaining under 4 per cent and a current account deficit remaining under 5 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On any assessment, while this scenario might be desirable, I think it is unlikely to be met. If we look at the present state of investment in plant and machinery, and if we look at the inherent sluggishness of the domestic economy following that spending binge of the late 1990s, the crisis of confidence and the cost of money, we have no doubt that there are enormous problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the other adverse factors such as the higher real interest rates in the business cycle, long term oversupply of commercial property, weak growth in household incomes, reflecting slow wages and high unemployment and slow employment growth, the continuing impact of the debt overhang, especially in the corporate sector, implying that any increase in incomes is likely to be put first to debt repayment and balance sheet repairs rather than investment in plant and equipment. That is a real negative. We have the continuation of sluggish world growth and the prospects of what is happening in Japan. We have Australia's relatively high current account deficit, the deficit that is continuing and the deficit that is going to be increased, as I see it, by the Appropriation Bills now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me, if I can revert back to that article by Tim Stevens, is that there is nothing in One Nation that is going to help the bush; there is nothing in the present prospect of weather conditions or the prospective failure of the GATT round that will allow the sector which on so many occasions in the past has helped Australia out of the rough to do so now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in 1982-83 the drought induced recession was ended by a rain soaked rural sector able to produce, willing to produce and producing, that is not going to happen now. The reason it is not going to happen now is that there is nothing in One Nation. It is a very good reason to accept Fightback. The alternative the coalition offers is that we provide positive assistance which, sadly, is totally lacking under the Labor package. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I wish to take advantage of the opportunity to make a few correcting observations about some comments made by the Opposition lead speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who suggested that there was something particularly incompetent about the Government's management of its budgetary process, as demonstrated by Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1991-92, that it was an unprecedented state of affairs to have such legislation brought before the House, that there was a funding crisis, and that funds were being used for purposes other than those that had been suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the House that the suggestions made by the honourable member for Curtin are quite without foundation. The fact is that the reasons for this Bill have been quite clearly spelt out by me in my second reading speech, in which it was clearly stated that there were three areas of expenditure which are the subject of the Bill: labour market programs, residential care for the elderly, and child-care fee relief. We faced unexpected demands in two cases and substantial additional pressure in the other, brought about by the measures announced in the November and One Nation statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the labour market programs, there was an increase of some $87m mainly as a result of the increase in the expenditure on labour market programs deliberately introduced by the Government in the November statement and, to a lesser extent, in the One Nation statement. In the case of residential care for the elderly, in the way that program is organised, if the religious, charitable and other organisations that are building capital works, for which they are entitled to Government assistance, for aged persons residential care move into a faster path of construction than has been forecast, that expenditure automatically increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to child-care fee relief, the increase in expenditure comes about because of the additional places over and above those forecast in the Budget, particularly in the private sector. That is a very welcome development and one which certainly accords with the Government's policy of increasing child-care places in the private sector. It comes about also because of the lower level of average income per person utilising the child-care places than was forecast, and therefore a higher level of fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of that nothing is being hidden from the Parliament. We have given the reasons why there is this funding pressure, which collectively mean that the demands on the Advance to the Minister for Finance are greater than the amount that is in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, and suggested that, if we waited for the normal Additional Estimates Bills, which are also before the House at the present time, to go through in the normal way, by the time those Bills were through the Senate we would have faced demands on the Advance to the Minister for Finance which could not be met and therefore there would be problems in terms of maintaining programs. To ensure that people who are the beneficiaries of these programs are not subject to the massive inconvenience that would otherwise result, this Bill is before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a Bill is not unprecedented. Last year we had a Bill of this kind before the House to meet another unexpected event, the Gulf war. The expenditure for the Commonwealth in the Gulf war meant there was more pressure for expenditure than could be met through the AMF, and we had a special Bill for that purpose. So it is not unprecedented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nor is it the case&mdash;and I strongly refute the suggestion by the honourable member for Curtin&mdash;that there is anything in this Bill which relates to the one-off family allowance payment to be made in April. The Opposition has been suggesting through its finance spokesman, Senator Short, that there is some such likelihood. I refuted that statement at the time he made it some days ago. It has now been repeated by the honourable member for Curtin. Let me repeat that the funding for the family allowance one-off payment in early April was provided for in the Bill which was brought into this House on 26 February and passed through the Senate on 5 March. The Opposition is simply not keeping up with what is happening in this place. The funding for the one-off payment has well and truly passed through this Parliament and is totally irrelevant to the Bill now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that this Bill is required in circumstances of unexpected pressures on the Advance to the Minister for Finance which cannot be met, and it is very sensible for the Parliament to give it a speedy passage. </PARA>

I do not know how one can make that sort of comparison at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) seems to have a confused view of how moneys are appropriated in this place. The mere fact of making a statement in November does not appropriate moneys; it simply announces that we are going to spend more in particular areas. An appropriation has then to be forthcoming. The appropriation, of course, was contained in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), involving an additional $87m, all but $5m of that coming from the additions to labour market program expenditure, if necessary in the context of the recession announced in the November statement and in the One Nation statement. Now those moneys have to be appropriated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an Appropriation Bill has not gone through the House and there is not sufficient money in the Advance to the Minister for Finance, obviously the moneys cannot be spent. Whether it is a Gulf war or labour market programs, the financing problem is the same. We need to have an appropriation to meet something which has occurred subsequent to the Budget which could not be catered for by the Advance to the Minister for Finance and which puts an obligation on the Government to try to ensure that it is able to meet its announced program of expenditures in a way which will mean that there are appropriations available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way that that can be done in these current circumstances is to have a Bill of this kind. There is nothing wrong with such an approach. It is an approach which will mean that there is parliamentary scrutiny in every way of these additional expenditures. In the Senate the Appropriation Bills normally go to the Estimates committees and are looked at in considerable detail. We have indicated that we have no objection whatsoever to the items involved in Appropriation Bill (No. 5) going to the Estimates committees even though the Bill will have been through the Senate by the time those committees get to consider the items. However, officials can be questioned in relation to those expenditures. We made that quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process, which has been explained several times, ensures that there is not a cessation or a cutback in expenditure for certain program areas. At the same time it gives the Parliament full scrutiny and is absolutely necessary because of events that have arisen since the Budget was brought down. There is nothing about a financial crisis in relation to that and the attempts by the honourable member for Dundas to talk in those terms are just beating up the issue extraordinarily. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the point the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has made. I certainly understand that there is a need for separate Appropriation Bills. Normally when these matters are dealt with they occur in a Budget context. The Budget is a statement. It is like the statement that was made in November and the One Nation statement. It is a statement by government and Appropriation Bills have to follow. Normally they are part and parcel of the Budget. When the Government makes its statement, it introduces Bills which deal with the appropriations that are necessary. In other words, it knows the consequences of the decisions that have been taken, and Appropriation Bills come in.</PARA></TALK.START>

It gets down to a question of timetabling. The fact is that, because of the way in which the Government had dealt with these matters, it was not in a position to pay its bills when they fell due. That is what it is about. It is like a person not being able to handle the payments of his bills when they fall due because he is, in one way or another, living beyond his means or has not been able to shift the money from one account to another. </PARA>

I regard it as even less of a beat-up when the Government is not able to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), One Nation. Like all my colleagues on this side of the House, I very much welcomed the commitments made in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, and as the member for the electorate of Moreton I am particularly pleased with a number of the initiatives contained in the statement. The One Nation statement contains some very real and very important initiatives which will improve employment prospects in my electorate and throughout the nation, and will provide some very positive benefits to constituents, to business, to the economy and to the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the most important thing to say about the One Nation statement is that it gives this country a very strong fighting chance to really succeed in the 1990s and to grow and further improve our export and economic performances. Unlike the Opposition's statement, allegedly known as Fightback, the One Nation statement actually does create real jobs for real Australians and gives some real hope for the future for Australians. It is those particular points that I would like to mention this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package promises to do a great deal in our community, and in particular it has an important emphasis on improved infrastructure. Within my electorate that infrastructure mainly refers to improved railway facilities. Two important projects that were announced in the One Nation statement which are of particular interest and benefit to my constituents are the freight rail line to the port of Brisbane and the new rail line from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. Both of these rail projects pass right through my electorate, and many hundreds of my constituents will receive the jobs that will be created by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that this Government is contributing $30m to the establishment of a standard gauge freight rail line to the port of Brisbane, because this link will mean that the port of Brisbane will provide a viable competitive alternative to the southern ports as a major port for the import and export of goods. At the moment, for southern businesses to have goods shifted to the Brisbane port by rail, the goods would need to be unloaded from a standard gauge train, which happens at Acacia Ridge depot, and then shifted onto alternative rail carriages or onto trucks, then transported to the port, unloaded again and put onto ships. This means that for movement of freight into and out of the port of Brisbane a double or triple handling process is involved, which costs money and makes the freight rail line very inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction of a standard gauge railway line to the port of Brisbane, and its inclusion in a number of other rail projects which will link the whole country together with one national standard gauge rail line, means that rail becomes a very efficient mover of goods and that freight traffic through the port of Brisbane will be cheaper and faster for all businesses, both in Queensland and in southern ports. That means that the port of Brisbane will continue to grow. It is already one of the most efficient ports in this country, and with this project it will be an even more efficient port. I am particularly pleased about that because it will also mean further growth and development of Queensland business with job opportunities for Queensland workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very many positive benefits for Queensland with the rail projects, but there are some community concerns about the freight rail line. I know that the residents of my electorate who live along the freight rail line are concerned about the possible impact of additional rail noise on their quality of life. It is an issue I am particularly concerned about because the urban environment and the noise of traffic, whether road, rail or air traffic, is a very important element in the quality of life for people in cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of additional trains along these lines needs to be considered by governments at both State and Federal level when they are developing this project. It has been one of my important tasks to raise with both the Queensland Minister for Transport, David Hamill, and my parliamentary colleague the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), the important question of ameliorating any noise impacts of this new freight line on the residents along the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken up the issue of trying to ensure that, when the environmental impact study is done on the impact of this rail line, comprehensive measures are undertaken to reduce the impact of rail noise on the residents. I have also asked for very serious consideration by the Federal Government of any submission by the State Government for an electrification process to occur for freight rail traffic along this line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rail line will massively improve the efficiency of the port of Brisbane, but in fact it will add only something like three or four trains a day along the line. The major noise problems along this rail line come from the existing freight rail traffic, and I am also working with the State and Federal Governments to put together a package to ensure that all that freight rail traffic through those suburban areas of Brisbane is electrified, because it is the 158 other freight trains that run past people's homes every week now that are causing most of the noise problems. For all the residents in about 14 suburbs who live quite close to that line we need to do something about that noise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most efficient and most effective way of achieving some reduction in noise is to add electric engines to the trains rather than the heavy, noisy diesel engines. The lines along which these trains will flow are already electrified because they are also passenger lines, so it is not a question of great expense to make the freight traffic electrified as well. It is just a question of purchasing additional electric engines to be added on at the Ipswich point or the Acacia Ridge point where the traffic changes. So I am hoping that the noise problem that my residents along that corridor currently suffer will be ameliorated by such measures, and it will be my task as their Federal representative to fight to get the necessary funds flowing from both State and Federal coffers to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the freight rail line will be proceeded with by this Government in concert with the Queensland Government. I am also pleased that the Federal Government has made a contribution towards the establishment of a passenger rail line to the Gold Coast. It has been something of a tragedy in Queensland that there has not been a rail line since 1957 from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. I think that has created considerable difficulties in the development of the corridor between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. I am pleased that this Government has had the foresight to finally put some money into this project to enable that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, a fair amount of the line from Brisbane to the Gold Coast will run through my electorate, and it will be the workers in my suburbs who will get a lot of the jobs on the construction. For them I am delighted at the funding of this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other measures in the One Nation statement that are of benefit, not just to my constituents but to the whole of Queensland and Australia. I refer particularly to some of the very important tax benefits that have been included in the statement and the new accelerated rates of depreciation on plant and equipment, which will considerably assist the many manufacturing companies and businesses in the industrial areas of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be unreasonable to suggest that a number of areas in my electorate represent the industrial heartland of southern Brisbane. I have the suburbs of Rocklea, Oxley, Archerfield, Coopers Plains and Moorooka, where most of the industry in southern Brisbane is located. Many thousands of residents in my electorate are employed in industries based in those suburbs, and every one of them will benefit from the accelerated rates of depreciation and the other tax measures that have been included in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the release of the One Nation statement, I have had some opportunities to speak with managers and other staff in these companies. Without exception they have expressed their very strong support for the measures that have been contained in the One Nation statement because of the assistance that they will provide for industries to re-equip and have some opportunities to expand in their production and, therefore, their employment. I am pleased that they will take up the opportunities offered in the One Nation statement to do just that. I think that is a very important element of the One Nation statement which contrasts most definitely with the Opposition's Fightback package; that is, that we have some very real and important measures in the One Nation statement that create real jobs. We do not just make judgments that maybe somewhere down the track jobs can be created; we are actually creating real jobs with real projects and with real measures that will benefit industry, business and commerce and the whole nation with expanded infrastructure projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the One Nation statement says, over the next four years there will be 800,000 additional jobs created. This is not just with the expansion of infrastructure projects, but also with the expansion of business and industry throughout the country, with the new measures that we have undertaken in both depreciation of plant and equipment and other tax measures. I am very pleased to be able to support the One Nation statement and to indicate that it has been received very well by the constituents of my electorate. They are very pleased with the measures contained in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that there are a number of measures in the statement which will also significantly expand the training and apprenticeship opportunities for the young people who live in my electorate. There is some concern within the community&mdash;a concern that I share&mdash;about the high levels of youth unemployment. I think it is very important that we take the opportunity now provided to us to expand the training and employment opportunities of youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the One Nation statement contains a comprehensive boost to TAFE. I think it is in the TAFE area that we have had a real problem with unmet demand in our tertiary education and higher education sector. In Queensland there has been quite a considerable campaign mounted about the number of young people who have been unable to get into universities. What they have ignored is the massive expansion in tertiary places that has occurred in the last nine years under this Government and the fact that this Federal Government has funded a considerable number of additional places for Queenslanders to go into universities and places of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area where we have a great deal of unmet demand is in the TAFE sector. Most of the unmet demand is from students who do not believe that TAFE will really address their needs. I think that indicates that we need to considerably expand our funding of TAFE and provide some improved facilities and services so that they are able to access good courses that are relevant and will be acceptable to the employers in this country. That is why I think it is very important that the Federal Government has grasped this issue very strongly and has put forward in the One Nation statement a considerable funding boost to TAFE which will enable it to address some of that unmet demand for training places and provide some real training and, therefore, future employment opportunities for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to support the One Nation statement, not just for the benefits that flow to my electorate but also for the benefits that I know flow to the whole community in Australia. I believe that it provides a very strong contrast to the Opposition's package and that the people of Australia will very clearly identify the sharp contrast between the ideological dreams of the Opposition, which contain no real substance, and the very real and positive benefits that will flow to Australia and all Australians from the measures it contains. </PARA>

<TITLE>Vietnam Veterans Job Link Program</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am speaking this evening on behalf of the Vietnam veterans job link program, an organisation in Western Australia which provides very important assistance to those ex-members of the defence forces who require assistance in gaining employment either immediately after leaving the service of the defence forces or later as they have left one particular job and moved back into the marketplace. The VVJLP was originally created to meet the needs of former Vietnam veterans re-entering the civilian work force after career disruptions due to military service obligations. It became obvious in the short term that this exclusive employment placement service should be rightly expanded to embrace all former Defence Force personnel and their direct dependants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past two years, the Vietnam veterans job link program has received a funding allocation from the Western Australian Department of Employment and Training, or DET, through its employment equity program. The actual cost of operating the service exceeded funds allocated by DET. This continued uncertainty in relation to future funding and support resulted in a lapse in job placement activity in early 1991. The organisation undertook a review which led to a total reorganisation of the committee and program functions. This program restructure resulted in a client base increase from 74 to 136 and the placement of 34 clients in permanent full time employment and 43 in casual temporary employment between 13 May and 24 September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the organisation is to place former Defence Force personnel and their direct dependants in employment. The target group for their services are all former Defence Force personnel and their direct dependants, including former defence personnel from allied nations who need job placement assistance. The organisational structure is quite simple. It operates from a location called Cypress Cottage. Personnel who are considered suitable are able to use that particular facility for recreation or to take the opportunity to collect their thoughts or plan how to restructure their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total funding required for the effective operation of the project is $84,518. To date it has received $50,000 from the Department of Employment and Training, as I have mentioned, leaving a shortfall of $34,518, which is required to ensure the continued operation and success of the program. Given the target group being serviced, it is the belief of the Vietnam Veterans job link program that the responsibility of funding the project should be shared between both the State and the Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has recently upgraded its accounts and records procedures and is therefore well placed to provide the respective funding bodies with regular financial and activity reports as required. Procedures have also been established to review the strategic plan on a quarterly basis, therefore ensuring the ongoing effective service provisions of the target group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past months the Vietnam veterans job link program has undergone a very stringent review and restructure, resulting in a dramatic increase in services being provided and outcomes being achieved. With a pending reduction in Defence Force personnel and the inception of the Ready Reserve scheme with its short term enlistment, the need for such a service becomes even more paramount. To realise its potential and to continue to place unemployed Vietnam veterans and former Defence Force personnel in employment and training, the project requires ongoing financial support from both State and Federal governments, which leaves, as I said, a shortfall of just under $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to list some of the services available through the Vietnam veterans job link program: canvassing business and employers for potential job placement; arranging work placement; increasing former Defence Force members' awareness of the job market through the development of vocational and job search skills; advice in personal presentation skills; assistance with resume preparation, job applications and interview techniques; information on the areas of employment, training, education, welfare and enterprise; information on accreditation of service skills; typing of resumes and letters; post-interview assistance; and information on the job market prior to discharge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to add my personal representation on behalf of the Vietnam veterans job link program so that it may receive assistance from the Defence Department for that valuable funding to be able to fulfil its total service to those Vietnam veterans and other Defence Force personnel who are, in fact, using its services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to reflect on some debate that has become much more current over  recent years about the future trends in the legal profession. In particular, I want to be positive about those elements in the legal profession that are quite courageously looking at the possibility of substantial reform, opening up the profession and dealing with some of the residual areas of anti-competitive behaviour which has been inherent in the profession over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the recent debate has been sparked most dramatically by a report of the Victorian Law Reform Commission in which it has proposed very substantial changes to the role of the traditional profession in Victoria. There are a number of areas which have attracted criticism by those concerned by competition issues:  the division between the Bar and solicitors and, in particular, one aspect of that, the two-counsel rule, which means that Queen's Counsel have traditionally been obliged to appear with a junior paid at two-thirds the rate of the senior;  the separation of the profession into different State entities, so that it is difficult for a professional to obtain reciprocal recognition between different States, which has prevented the development of an all-Australian profession;  and the question of advertising, where the profession has traditionally resisted what ordinarily would have been seen to be a pro-competitive approach by barring advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that regard the profession is often criticised for establishing what are broadly regarded as minimum price fixing arrangements through the promulgation of scales of fees. In regard to that matter, Mr Speaker, I sought an audience with you earlier and indicated that I would wish to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a table which sets out the solicitors' remuneration scale in Tasmania and a survey of some legal fees. I have sought leave from the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), to incorporate that document in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I seek leave to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the interesting things in terms of both the scale of fees that is demonstrated and the survey that was conducted is that there is a very competitive market indeed in lawyers' services, notwithstanding the minimum price that is established under the scale of fees that is promulgated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, approximately just under one-half of the practices surveyed showed that they were charging less than scale fees. I regard that and the other information contained in that survey as very refreshing. I think it shows the profession in a very positive light, although a number within the profession will no doubt resent the fact that they are exposed through surveys of that kind to examination by the public. I believe it is very much in the profession's interest to welcome an examination of its operations and to move towards a situation in which its members are prepared to advertise. It does not seem to me to be correct that the profession is, in a sense, still regarding itself as being in the gentleman's club environment of the 1800s when the rest of the professions have had to face up to very competitive pressures in the marketplace and to adopt very pro-competitive approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would very much like the law societies to abolish the establishment of scales of fees and to permit advertising. That is a very live issue that, as I indicated, has been raised by the Victorian Law Reform Commission. There is very good theoretical justification for concluding that advertising would reduce the cost of producing legal services. For example, I cite an article by Muris and McChesney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">American Bar Foundation Research Journal</EMPHASIS>, Winter 1979, at pages 179 to 207.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Treatment outside RGHs will be approved only in special circumstances, such as where the necessary treatment cannot be provided at the RGH or in an emergency which results in admission to the nearest suitable facility. Excepting emergency, admission must be arranged with the prior approval of my Department. In the case of emergency, approval must be sought as soon as possible afterwards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Department tells me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">you will appreciate that circumstances vary for each patient and a decision on each case must therefore be considered on its merits. However, in giving approval to being treated outside of departmental facilities, factors such as the medical and social condition of the patient, the clinical urgency of the proposed treatment, access to the RGH and the resulting waiting time are all taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>My constituent is 87 years of age, he is a Changi veteran, his wife is 80 years of age and too frail to travel. Yet the Department, having considered this case, has said to me that no special circumstances apply. I understand the basis for the general policy. But if we get to a situation in this country in which the specific circumstances of an individual like this man&mdash;an 87-year-old veteran suffering constant pain, with an 80-year-old wife&mdash;cannot be treated on those merits, bureaucracy has gone mad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Minister, who I know to be a compassionate man, should intervene personally in this matter. I expect him to do so. I am quite prepared to make the name of my constituent available to the Minister;  in fact, I have already made it available to the Department. Given the sacrifice of people such as my constituent, if the Minister does not intervene on behalf of this veteran of 87 years of age who is in constant pain and seeking to be treated locally, I can only say that the administration of this Government of the people who have defended the country in the most difficult circumstances available&mdash;and we can think of no more difficult circumstances than being an inmate of the Changi system during the Second World War&mdash;is in more than a sad state. It is a vicious indictment of the approach of this Government towards the very real and personal problems of veterans who, in the latter stages of their life, surely deserve better treatment than this bureaucratic approach which has been demonstrated in this instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of the House a very sad case of a woman who lives in my electorate. I will call her Lorraine. Lorraine is an invalid pensioner. She has two children, aged 14 and 16, both going to school. She is a very compassionate person and has another child who is boarding with her. The child is there because she needs Lorraine's help. Lorraine is not a particularly well woman. I will read a letter that I received from Lorraine's doctor. The opening paragraph states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unfortunate lady suffers from severe, recurrent, resistant complex partial epilepsy. She has seizures almost daily, and, in spite of treatment, the seizures are not completely controllable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, each time and she has to go four times a year. The program offers 50 per cent to a maximum of $30. We find that the Victorian Government has now introduced the program, which in principle is terrific, but it is city based and city oriented. It enables those people who live in the inner city to get to doctors close by. Once again, country people are being disadvantaged by a government which claims it is caring, but it is only caring for people in the city electorates and the country people are disregarded because they are not strong Labor voters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one of my staff members rang the director of the multi-purpose taxi program, Mr Robert Stonem, and suggested that it was a city based program, he got upset.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the Seamen's Union because I think it has come in for a lot of unfair criticism from The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who is still living in the past. The reality today is that the manning rate on Australian ships is comparable to that in any OECD country, while Australian maritime wages are in the lower sector of OECD wages. We are much cheaper than most OECD countries, but this is not generally recognised. In the past, there was a higher manning rate but this was partly due to inefficiencies that occurred through having outdated ships. With the modern ships it is a different story altogether. I think BHP would acknowledge that it is probably making more money out of its iron ore tankers manned by Australian crews going to Japan than Japanese manned tankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important because Australia is a maritime nation. As Kep Enderby once observed, we are surrounded by sea. That is one of his more profound statements, but it is true. Australia desperately needs a maritime service of its own. This is one of the areas where we can make our quickest and best current account savings. If Australia is to carry a greater percentage of its produce in its own ships, we would be making substantial savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would be making even greater savings if we were to build the ships here. I have been talking to a fellow from Sweden. This particular gentleman set up the computerised ship building industry in Germany and has now moved to Australia. He says that Australia is, in his view, the best place in the world to build large ships for the reason that we have a very good skill base and that the quality of our tradesmen is second to none in the world. I might add that this is a Swedish view, not an Australian view. He also says that we have the best weather in the world for building ships but what is lacking in Australia is management&mdash;which has been appalling&mdash;and infrastructure. He said that, given the right infrastructure and proper management, he believes that Australia can competitively build ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a great thing it would be for Australia if we could establish a viable shipbuilding industry&mdash;build our own ships and carry Australian produce in them. Think of the employment and the wealth it would create for Australia in terms of current account savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another thing that ought to be considered. Australia is competitive with the OECD countries, but we should not expect our seamen to compete with a rust bucket and a rice bowl. It is irresponsible to expect that. I believe that these ships create a real danger for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A ship in Western Australia broke its bow and spewed oil into the Indian Ocean. In my view that ship was heading for the rocks. If it was not, it certainly had no business to be where it was. Foreign owners were prepared to risk our environment for the sake of the money that they were going to get from that operation. I believe that if we had our own ships we could have much better environmental control of our coasts than exists at the moment and we could take very strong action against anybody who threatened that environment. If this imposes any cost, it is a cost that can certainly be absorbed in the confidence, the safety and the environmental security it would give us. </PARA>

At the moment this ship, which is run by ANL, built in the last two or three years in Newcastle, is going backwards and forwards across the strait with 60 of these containers on the top deck filled with sand.

We have seen just what the Opposition's Fightback package would mean to education in this country, particularly tertiary education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I grew up as a young man, very few young people had the opportunity to go on to university and obtain the qualifications that would have made this country a greater country than it is today. It concerns me that the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is running around now trying to pursue a rather draconian attitude towards education, particularly tertiary education. The reception he received at the Queensland University in the last couple of weeks when he went there would have been an indication of the concern amongst students. It is good to see the young people in the nation in that context being prepared to stand up and be counted and to express their grave concern. There is little doubt that, whilst some students have expressed their concerns about HECS and what have you, HECS does provide the opportunity for a tertiary education for all people, no matter what their financial backgrounds. There is little doubt that the Opposition's Fightback package would deny the great majority of Australians&mdash;young Australians particularly&mdash;the opportunity to have a tertiary education. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great commitment from this Labor Government, particularly since 1983, to assist our young people in the education areas. When we talk about where it may cost students up to $2,000 in HECS every year, we are talking about between $25,000 and $130,000 for a single degree under the Opposition's Fightback package. Which working class people in this country are going to be able to afford such draconian proposals as those that the Opposition puts forward? It is a negative thing. It is a deliberate attack on the young people of this country and it should be rejected for what it is. Honourable members opposite should find a bit of backbone amongst themselves and start telling the leaders within their own parties that it is not on; that it is a ridiculous thing to attack our education system when Australia has the opportunity to be the clever country that we justly deserve to be&mdash;and we are. We have a very capable population. We can see from some of the reports that have been put forward in this Parliament in the last couple of days that the future of Australia lies in a well-educated population.

I encourage Opposition backbenchers to stand up and think about their own children for a start, and their children, so that we do not return to a situation where once again the tertiary education system is available only to the rich. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's withdrawal from the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (CIPEC) in 1986 followed a review which found, in essence, that the costs of our membership (A$217,000 that year) far exceeded the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia produces only a small volume of copper (around 3% of world production) and thus our ability to influence the market and/or the organisation was limited. Moreover, the cost of membership of CIPEC was increasing disproportionately in relation to the benefits. Given this, and the fact that there were no foreign relations considerations which would justify our continued participation despite the costs, Australia withdrew its membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contacts with other copper producing countries have, however, been maintained through our aid and other policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision in respect of Australia's withdrawal from the International Bauxite Association (IBA) was also based on cost/benefit considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, a review conducted by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs &amp; Trade, concluded that membership of the IBA was not cost-effective&mdash;the costs of membership far outweighed the benefits; the organisation comprised producer members only and thus consumer views were not adequately represented; there were no compelling foreign policy considerations which would justify continued participation; and industry did not support continued membership. In reaching this conclusion, it was noted that notwithstanding budget cuts in 1986-88 (largely initiated by Australia), the IBA budget had increased 21 per cent in 1989-91 in US dollar terms, resulting in a 50% increase in Australia's contributions to A$388,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore wrote to other IBA member governments in September 1991 advising that Australia had decided to withdraw from the Association. In accordance with the rules of the Association, this will take effect from October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the world's largest bauxite and alumina producer and the fourth largest aluminium producer. The industry is an important source of employment and export income. Accordingly, in publicly announcing the decision on 12 November 1991, I noted our continuing interest in developments in this industry and said that Australia remains willing to consider, with other countries, cost-effective ways of ensuring continued co-operation and information exchange. Australian officials are actively participating in the search for ways to continue dialogue on the bauxite/alumina/ aluminium industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Social Security Act sickness allowance is not paid to full-time students. Income support for students is available under the AUSTUDY program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training pays AUSTUDY to eligible full-time students subject to an income and assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTUDY can be paid during periods of short-term illness or injury as long as the student remains </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">enrolled full-time. The illness/injury provisions allow payment to continue for up to sixteen weeks in a year in the case of tertiary students or at the school's discretion in the case of secondary students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For self employed or part-time employed students ineligible for AUSTUDY because of the AUSTUDY income test, loss of earnings due to illness would qualify them for sickness allowance only if they ceased full-time study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Social Security Act 1991 provides the legislative basis for the payment of Sickness Allowance. The Student Assistance Act 1973 is the legislative basis for AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) No. Full-time students can be eligible for AUSTUDY, including during periods of short-term illness or injury. Payment of sickness allowance to full-time students who are not eligible for AUSTUDY because their income is over the allowable AUSTUDY income test level would circumvent the AUSTUDY income test. This test is designed to direct income support to those students most in need.</PARA>
